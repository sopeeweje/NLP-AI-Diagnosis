"Computational modeling of 60Hz STN DBS for gait disorder in Parkinson's disease Project Summary The therapeutic gain of subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) for Parkinson’s disease (PD) has relied on high frequency stimulation (HFS) (e.g., 130-185Hz) to alleviate cardinal motor symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia and tremor, along with levodopa motor complications (e.g., motor fluctuations and dyskinesia). As the disease progresses, gait disorder, including freezing of gait, may emerge, increasing the risk of falls while limiting socialization and quality of life. Oftentimes, such symptoms are recalcitrant to dopaminergic medications and STN-DBS. Studies suggest that low frequency stimulation (60-80Hz) may improve gait in those with chronic DBS. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 60Hz STN-DBS provides gait improvement within the first year of DBS implantation. However, there is limited data on the nature of this response, in terms of what aspects of gait respond and its relation to dopaminergic medications. In addition, based on preliminary results, it is possible to use machine-learning models to identify patients who may overall benefit from 60Hz STN-DBS based solely on preoperative assessments. However, the extent to which patients’ symptoms may improve under 60Hz STN-DBS needs to be further investigated. This project aims to (1) investigate the impact of 60Hz STN-DBS on gait kinematics using wearable sensors; and (2) develop machine learning models to predict response of STN-DBS patient symptomatology at both high frequency and 60Hz based on sensor profiles of PD motor symptoms at baseline. Parkinson’s patients with gait disorder who will either be undergoing STN-DBS implantation or already have chronic bilateral STN-DBS will be recruited. We will conduct the study in two phases: Phase I – obtain baseline kinematic profile for each subject in terms of tremor, bradykinesia, and gait using objective sensor measurements in the unmedicated and levodopa-ON states. We will specifically assess gait parameters within three domains: postural sway, gait speed and rhythm (cadence), and circumduction. Phase II – participants will be evaluated in two conditions: 1) OFF medication/ON stimulation; 2) ON medication/ON stimulation. Sensor-based gait analysis will be done in 60Hz and HFS modes for each DBS electrode contact pair in the different medication states. Following data collection, statistical analysis will be performed and machine learning models will be developed to accomplish aims (1) and (2). Accordingly, this study will help determine the aspects of gait influenced by 60Hz stimulation and how it is affected by levodopa, while potentially identifying certain 60Hz responsive PD phenotypic subtypes. It will also allow for instantaneous recommendations by artificial intelligence on which stimulation frequency is best suitable for a subject based on a priori sensor measurements of motor symptoms. The ranking provided can guide clinical evaluations and programming through a sensor guided paradigm.

"CRCNS: Deep Neural Network Approaches for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation The discovery that aberrant synchronization of rhythmic neuronal activity recorded in PD patients is suppressed by DBS has advanced the concept that measures associated with pathological activity may be used as biomarkers to control the delivery of DBS therapy. Pilot studies of aDBS in PD have reported promising clinical results from triggering DBS stimulation when the signal recorded from the DBS electrode showed a high level of oscillatory power in the beta frequency range (13 – 35 Hz). That approach, however, has important limitations. Most importantly, beta power recorded from the DBS lead is suppressed by movement including PD tremor, its detection is highly dependent on lead location and the recording montage needed to record during stimulation is incompatible with directional current steering, a recent innovation employing segmented stimulation contacts. The inherent complexity of the increased parameter space through DBS innovations also overwhelms standard programming techniques. Finally, use of additional biomarker signals (e.g., recorded from cortex) is likely to improve the ability to adaptively control DBS for disorders marked by complex multidimensional symptomatologies such as PD. The current proposal will establish methods for overcoming these limitations by developing techniques for multi-feature classification from ECoG recordings, using advanced machine learning algorithms. The proposed research builds upon the extensive and unique experiences with multi-day, extra-operative recording from DBS leads in patients at Charité Hospital and intraoperative ECoG and DBS recording from patients at the University of Pittsburgh, in order to develop computational methods to advance closed-loop, adaptive DBS (aDBS) strategies for movement disorders. This research seeks to improve computational methods for interpreting brain signals recorded from patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease. The results may inform the design of novel strategies for biomarker-responsive brain stimulation.",CRCNS: Deep Neural Network Approaches for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,10021999,R01NS110424,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Berlin', 'Biological Markers', 'Bradykinesia', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'reduce symptoms', 'remote sensor', 'symptomatology', 'translational neuroscience']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,228673,0.03256636615384111
"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies). Ultimately, this research aims to improve the lives and wellbeing of those suffering from spinal cord injury. Successful completion of this research will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” ! 1!",MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury,9674165,R03HD094577,"['Acute', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Correlation Studies', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Event', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Length', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Team', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rogaine', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord damage', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dorsal column', 'early detection biomarkers', 'expectation', 'functional independence', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'motor deficit', 'motor function recovery', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'restoration', 'secondary outcome', 'social', 'spinal cord imaging']",NICHD,REGIS UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,96034,0.0022924024539927135
"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles. This effort will contribute to the restoration of voluntary limb movements in individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke.",Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation,9699018,R01NS102259,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Digit structure', 'Elbow', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Error Sources', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Forearm', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Joints', 'Lifting', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Fatigue', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Space', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Quadriplegia', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'artificial neural network', 'awake', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experience', 'finger movement', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'grasp', 'hand grasp', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroprosthesis', 'nonhuman primate', 'response', 'restoration', 'robotic device', 'scapula']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,329650,0.0052902412815769686
"Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots PROJECT SUMMARY This application will result in a technological platform that re-empowers persons with severe paralysis, by allowing them to independently control a wide spectrum of robotic actions. Severe paralysis is devastating, and chronic—and reliance on caregivers is persistent. Assistive machines such as wheelchairs and robotic arms offer a groundbreaking path to independence: where control over their environment and interactions is returned to the person.  However, to operate complex machines like robotic arms and hands typically poses a difﬁcult learning challenge and requires complex control signals—and the commercial control interfaces accessible to persons with severe paralysis (e.g. sip-and-puff, switch-based head arrays) are not adequate. As a result, assistive robotic arms remain largely inaccessible to those with severe paralysis—arguably the population who would beneﬁt from them most.  The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. Control interfaces that generate a unique map from a user's body motions to control signals for a machine offer a customized interaction, however these interfaces have only been used to issue low-dimensional (2-D) control signals whereas more complex machines require higher-dimensional (e.g. 6-D) signals. We propose an approach that leverages robotics autonomy and machine learning in order to aid the end-user in learning how to issue effective higher-dimensional control signals through body motions. Speciﬁcally, initially the human issues a lower- dimensional control signal and robotics autonomy is used to bridge the gap by taking over whatever is not covered by the human's control signal. Help from the robotics autonomy is then progressively scaled back, automatically, to cover fewer and fewer control dimensions as the user becomes more skilled.  The ﬁrst piece to our approach deals with how to extract control signals from the human, using the body-machine interface. The development and optimization of decoding procedures for controlling a robotic arm using residual body motions will be addressed under Speciﬁc Aim 1. The second piece to our approach deals with how to interpret control signals from a human within a paradigm that shares control between the human and robotics autonomy. To identify which shared-control formulations most effectively utilize the human's control signals will be the topic of Speciﬁc Aim 2. The ﬁnal piece to our approach deals with how to adapt the shared-control paradigm so that more control is transferred to the human over time. This adaptation is necessary for the human's learning process, since the goal in the end is for the human to be able to fully control the robotic arm him/herself, and will be assessed under Speciﬁc Aim 3.  At the completion of this project, tetraplegic end-users will be able to operate a robotic arm using their residual body motions, through an interface that both promotes the use of residual body motions (and thus also recovery of motor skill) and adapts with the human as their abilities change over time. By leveraging adaptive robotics autonomy, our application moreover provides a safe mechanism to facilitate learning how to operate the robotic platform. Frequently the more severe a person's motor impairment, the less able they are to operate the very assistive machines, like powered wheelchairs and robotic arms, which might enhance their quality of life. The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means, through non-invasive technologies, to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. We propose and study an approach that leverages robot machine learning and autonomy in order to facilitate human motor learning of how to operate a robotic arm using a customized interface, in order to make powered assisted manipulation more accessible to people with severe paralysis. 1",Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots,9773039,R01EB024058,"['3-Dimensional', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Residual state', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shoulder', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injured survivor', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'arm', 'assistive robot', 'base', 'body-machine interface', 'brain machine interface', 'empowerment', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'n-dimensional', 'novel strategies', 'physical conditioning', 'psychologic', 'robot control', 'sensor', 'two-dimensional']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2019,329494,0.012822221782936832
"Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is our ability to perform complex, yet previously un-practiced tasks successfully on the first attempt. We refer to this ability as `ad hoc self-programming': `ad hoc' because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; `self-programming' because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. This type of learning differs importantly from trial-and-error learning, in which responses are sculpted incrementally, based on feedback from previous attempts. In comparison to trial-and-error learning, much less is known about ad hoc self- programmed learning, but it clearly represents a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The overall goal of our research proposal is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.  There have been significant barriers to the study of this topic. Among them are the difficulty of studying these processes in animals who require training (which by definition precludes single-trial self- programming), and the lack of access to opportunities with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to study neuronal processes in humans.  The proposed research seeks to address this gap. We leverage critical advances in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and computational modelling, including: 1) availability of a large-scale recording platform enabling simultaneous recordings of 100+ neurons from the cortical surface; 2) opportunities to record from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in human subjects engaged in a custom-designed behavioral task; 3) developments borrowed from the artificial intelligence community to create advanced neural network models of complex cognitive processes.  By applying these innovative methodologies, we focus on addressing our overall goal with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we determine what information about the structure of a novel, complex, instructed task is represented in human dlPFC neuronal activity. We also determine how and when this information is encoded, in terms of spiking activity, oscillatory activity, or coherence between the two. In Aim 2, we determine the relationship between these neuronal representations and behavior. We investigate how the robustness and timing of the emergence of required neural representations relates to response accuracy and reaction time. In Aim 3, we develop a computational model of ad hoc self-programmed learning. To do so, we borrow from recent insights in the AI world regarding prefrontal network structure, and also apply our developing understanding of neural representations from the previous Aims.  We expect that this innovative approach will revolutionize our understanding of this amazing capacity for immediate, configurable learning that characterizes our everyday lives. In doing so, we will develop new strategies to study mechanisms of rapid, flexible cognitive control in general. A better understanding of human cognitive control and its nuanced capacities will naturally translate into an appreciation of deficiencies in these processes, and how they manifest in the form of neuropsychiatric disorders. This appreciation can then lead to the development of rational, targeted therapies. Project Narrative In our everyday lives, we frequently encounter situations that we have never previously faced, but to which we must respond appropriately on the first attempt. The human brain's remarkable ability to rapidly reconfigure its cognitive circuitry to match new task demands and thereby enable such behavior is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The proposed studies leverage exciting new developments in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and artificial intelligence to understand the neuronal circuitry underlying this amazing capacity.","Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex",9792299,U01NS108923,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amaze', 'Animals', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'computational basis', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2019,665648,-0.050958436114345335
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9675333,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning ability', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,363758,0.011827553957879506
"Tools for modeling state-dependent sensory encoding by neural populations across spatial and temporal scales Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the natural acoustic environment. They adapt their hearing to emphasize the features of sound that are important for making behavioral decisions. Normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy scenes and to understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. A better understanding of the function of the healthy and impaired auditory system will support new treatments for these deficits. This project will develop computational tools to study central auditory processing. A software library will support fitting and evaluating a large number of encoding models to describe the functional relationship between a time-varying natural auditory stimulus and the corresponding neural response. Many such models have been proposed, but relatively few direct comparisons have been made between them. This project will enable their comparison, allowing identification of the key features that contribute positively to their performance. The system will have a modular design so that useful elements from different models can be combined into comprehensive models with even greater explanatory power. The software will be open source and will support data from multiple recording modalities, including small-scale single unit electrophysiological and calcium imaging data, as well as large-scale local field and magnetoencephalography data. In addition to building on existing hypotheses about neural coding, the system will support machine learning methods for fitting artificial neural network models using the same datasets. These large, data-driven models have proven valuable for wide ranging signal processing problems, but their value and relation to existing models for neural sensory processing remain to be explored. Sensory processing involves coherent activity of large neural populations. To study coding at the population level, the system will support models that characterize the simultaneous activity of multiple neural signals and identifies latent subspaces of population activity related to sound encoding. Sensory coding is also influenced by behavioral context, reflecting changes in behavioral demands and the more general environment. The system will incorporate behavioral state variables into models, where encoding properties can be modulated by changes in behavioral context. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particularly in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the neural populations in the healthy brain represent complex natural sounds. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Tools for modeling state-dependent sensory encoding by neural populations across spatial and temporal scales,9774688,R01EB028155,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual system structure', 'artificial neural network', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'computerized tools', 'data format', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'online repository', 'open source', 'receptive field', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'tool']",NIBIB,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,794000,0.012149467857511514
"Quantifying causality for neuroscience Abstract: Causality is central to neuroscience. For example, we might ask about the causal effect of a neuron on another neuron, or its influence on perception, action, or cognition. Moreover, any medical approaches aim at producing a causal effect – effecting improvements for patients. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard to establish causality, but they are not always practical. For example, while we can electrically or optogenetically activate entire areas, large-scale targeted stimulation of individual neurons is hard. Other ways of establishing causality are problematic: if we observe a correlation it is hard to know its cause. The problem is confounding: there are variables that we do not record that affect the variables we do. This also renders model comparisons problematic – a causally wrong model with few parameters may well fit the observed data better than a causally correct one with many parameters. We thus need data analysis tools that allow authoritatively asking causal questions without the need for random perturbation experiments.  Just like neuroscience now, the field of econometrics once focused on correlations. But since the 1980s, empirical economics has undergone a so-called credibility revolution, requiring the development of rigorous methods to establish causality. Several successful methods have emerged to become the workhorses of empirical economics. The idea underlying these methods is that if one can observe variables that approximate random perturbations, then one can still discover causal relations. This is what economists call a quasi-experiment. We here propose to carry over such quasi-experimental techniques to neuroscience. For example in neuroscience, if there is a random variable that affects only one neuron, then any activity in other neurons correlated with that variable must be causally affected by the neuron. Another famous quasi- experimental method is regression discontinuity design (RDD). This approach effectively uses the noise introduced at the threshold to identify causal relations. Importantly, such techniques have, thanks to decades of research in econometrics, very well understood statistical properties. These approaches promise to considerably enrich the approaches towards causality we have in neuroscience. We have a strong interdisciplinary team, spanning economics, experimental, and computational neuroscience, collaborating on adapting these quasi-experimental techniques to problems in neuroscience through a combination of machine learning and domain-specific engineering. This promises to be a major advance relative to current techniques that generally approach causality in neuroscience through model comparison. Project Narrative: The goal of this project is to develop a set of computational techniques that allow neuroscientists to quantify how neurons causally influence one another. To do so, it utilizes approaches popular in econometrics called quasiexperiments. Such approaches to quantify causality is important as medical perturbations of brains, e.g. treatments of epilepsy or depression are aimed at effecting or causing a change in the brain.",Quantifying causality for neuroscience,9775861,R01EB028162,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'econometrics', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'optogenetics', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,803000,-0.013862930602820208
"Neurophysiologically-informed Design of Flexible, 2-learner Brain-Machine Interfaces for Robust and Skillful Performance PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to elucidate the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing. The outcome of the proposed work has the potential to guide the development of the next generation of neurophysiologically-informed, cortically-controlled neuroprosthetic systems for patients with neurological disorders. State-of-the-art brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage machine learning to rapidly calibrate to the neural activity of individuals, but performance also benefits from subjects learning to reliably produce desired neural activity patterns. The basic science and engineering principles of designing such a “2-learner BMI” in which the brain and machine synergistically learn are not well understood. Hence, this proposal aims to investigate how the brain learns when the machine undergoes different degrees of learning, how different degrees of brain learning affect long-term BMI performance, robustness, and generalization, and how these principles can guide the design of a 2-learner BMI system which facilitates brain learning. The proposal is structured in three aims: 1) To study the impact of decoder adaptation on the development of neural encoding models underlying neuroprosthetic skill; 2) To Study how decoder adaptation and resultant neural encoding model influences BMI performance with perturbations (robustness) and BMI performance on unpracticed tasks (generalization); and 3) Design and validation of the next-generation Flexible 2-Learner Decoder architecture. The analyses and experiments proposed in these aims will leverage the fundamental knowledge gained about how the brain learns and acquires neuroprosthetic skills into the neurophysiologically-informed design of robust and high-performance closed-loop motor neuroprosthetics that generalize to new tasks. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will advance our understanding of the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing.

"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program will establish new framework for understanding the cognitive neuroscience architecture of scene perception, with the aim of unraveling how the human brain analyzes the geometry and functionality of visual environment in order to guide our actions and navigation in the world.",Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene,9694232,R01EY026042,"['3-Dimensional', '4 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Floor', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visuospatial', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'vector']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,318065,0.005615480834963632
"Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Selective attention is an essential cognitive ability that permits us to effectively process and act upon relevant information while ignoring distracting events. A network involving frontal and parietal cortex for top-down attentional control, referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), is active during both spatial and non- spatial (feature-based) attention. However, we know very little about the fine structure of attentional control activity in the DAN, how this structure changes to represent different to-be-attended stimulus features, how the connectivity within the DAN, and between the DAN and sensory cortex shifts when attending different features, or how these top-down processes and their influence in sensory cortex unfold over time. This gap in our knowledge is a critical problem for our models and theories of attention, and because attentional deficits are involved in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia. The working model guiding this research is that top-down attentional control, based on different to-be-attended stimulus attributes, is guided by a smaller-scale neural fine structure within the DAN and prefrontal cortex that makes specific connections with specialized areas of visual cortex coding the attended attributes. Moreover, the time course of activity within the DAN in relation to that in sensory cortex follows a top-down cascading model, being earliest in frontal, then parietal cortex, and finally sensory cortex for preparatory, voluntary, attentional control. To identify the functional networks for attentional control for different forms of attention, and to define their time courses, this project uses innovative simultaneous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Advanced signal processing and modeling, including multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), graph theoretic connectivity analysis, and Granger causality analysis will be used to reveal the fine functional anatomy and time course of attentional control and selection. The project includes three experiments that vary the to-be-attended stimulus attributes from spatial location to stimulus features (color and motion), and pursues three aims. Aim 1 is to reveal the fine structure of top-down preparatory attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus features. Aim 2 is to elucidate the specific connectivity between fine structures for preparatory attentional control in the DAN and their target sensory structures in sensory cortex. Aim 3 is to reveal the time course of top-down attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus attributes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The capacity to focus attention is at the core of human mental functioning, and therefore, elucidating the neural bases of attention remains a central challenge for neuroscience, representing an essential aim in translational efforts to ameliorate attentional deficits in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia.",Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning,9718308,R01MH117991,"['Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Color', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Discrimination', 'Dorsal', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'data integration', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mental function', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective attention', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2019,530307,-0.005552754111156748
"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function.

"CRCNS: Neural Basis of Planning Humans and other animals can choose their actions using multiple learning algorithms and decision­ making strategies. For example, habitual behaviors adapted to a stable environment can be selected using so-called model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, in which the value of each action is incrementally updated according to the amount of unexpected reward. The underlying neural mechanisms for this type of reinforcement learning have been intensively studied. By contrast, how the brain utilizes the animal's knowledge of its environment to plan sequential actions using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm remains unexplored. In this application, PIs with complementary expertise will investigate how different subdivisions of the primate prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and arbitration of different learning algorithms during strategic planning in primates, using a sequential game referred to as ""4-in-a­ row"". Previous studies have revealed that with training, humans improve their competence in this game by gradually switching away from a model-free reinforcement learning towards a model-based reinforcement learning in the form of a tree search. In the first set of experiments, we will train non-human primates to play the 4-in-a-row game against a computer opponent. We predict that the complexity of the strategic planning and the opponent's move violating the animal's expectation will be reflected in the speed of animal's action and pupil diameters. Next, we will test how the medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and selection of different learning algorithms during strategic interaction between the animal and computer opponent. We hypothesize that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in computing the integrated values of alternative actions originating from multiple sources and guiding the animal's choice, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex might be more involved in monitoring and resolving the discrepancies of actions favored by different learning algorithms. The results from these experiments will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms for complex strategic planning and unify various approaches to study naturalistic behaviors. By taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning and decision neuroscience, proposed studies will elucidate how multiple learning algorithms are simultaneously implemented and coordinated via specific patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex. The results from these studies will transform the behavioral and analytical paradigms used to study high-order planning and their neural underpinnings in humans and animals.

"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment.

"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. ! ! . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. !",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,9929246,UH3NS103550,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'antidepressant effect', 'base', 'clinical implementation', 'connectome', 'control trial', 'evidence base', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'response', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'white matter']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,UH3,2019,165527,0.016006855917989175
"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9685036,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2019,50016,0.0018795949009934832
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9645112,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'source localization', 'surgery outcome']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2019,516327,-0.002722081473028863
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning. Deep understanding of sensory-motor systems will aid in development of new treatment modalities for diseases that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. n/a","CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling",9730639,R01NS100049,"['Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Huntington Disease', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'control theory', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional plasticity', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mathematical analysis', 'medical schools', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'sensorimotor system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,205290,-0.007946905187600682
"Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understanding how stored memories change as a function of experience. The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weaker—it can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia. In all of these conditions, cogni- tive deficits can arise from insufficient separation of representations. This research may lead to better ways of re-differentiating these representations and—through this—ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits. NARRATIVE This work has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of when learning decreases overlap between memories in the brain (differentiation) or increases overlap (integration). Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dementia, and dyslexia: In all of these conditions, cognitive deficits can arise when there is insufficient neural separation of memories or concepts (e.g., temporal lobe stroke can “collapse” stored visual knowledge, preventing retrieval of names of common objects). The learning models and interventions developed here may eventually lead to new and better ways of re-differentiating these collapsed representa- tions and ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits.","Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning",9741542,R01MH069456,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Running', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'behavioral study', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'memory retrieval', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'phonology', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,455418,-0.006850385124449913
"Cracking the Olfactory Code Project Summary (Overall: Cracking the Olfactory Code)  Sensation drives perception, which informs decisions and actions. Olfaction is the main sense used by most animals to interact with the environment. However, olfaction remains shrouded in mystery — we do not know which molecular odorant features matter to the olfactory system and which do not, how information about these features is recombined to create holistic odor representations within the brain, or how those representations relate to perception. As a consequence, we lack an empirical understanding of the core transformations taking place at each stage of olfactory processing, which ultimately lead to perception and behavior. In addition, we lack a clear theoretical framework for understanding how a stimulus space that is both discrete and high-dimensional yields a perceptual space that is continuous and low dimensional. Because the olfactory system is “shallow” — meaning that within two synapses information about complete odor objects is abstracted and generalized — understanding this specific circuit will also afford general insight both into architecturally-related allocortical brain regions critical to behavior (e.g., cerebellum, hippocampus), and into cortical centers that play a key role in integrating diverse sources of information (e.g., prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex). Here we propose to reveal the computational logic of olfaction by collecting the first system-wide dataset of neural and perceptual responses to a large, principled set of odorants, and by applying a unified statistical and theoretical approach to its interpretation. This project will convene research groups with expertise that spans neurobiology, and will leverage recent technical advances in molecular genetics, neural imaging, electrophysiology, opto- and chemogenetics, human psychophysics, and machine learning to interrogate all levels (from peripheral receptors to cortex to perceptual and behavioral output) of the olfactory system. Taken together, these experiments will establish a reference dataset that reveals the key transformations performed by the olfactory system, test a key unifying theory for olfaction, and create a community-wide resource that will prompt new theory and experiment. This work will also have wide-ranging implications for our general understanding of how sensory information is organized in the brain to facilitate adaptive action. Project Narrative (Overall) The brain builds rich internal representations of the external world in order to support perception and behavior. Here we take advantage of the architectural simplicity of the mammalian olfactory system — and an interdisciplinary team whose expertise ranges from molecular genetics and optogenetic to machine learning and human psychophysics — to characterize how odor information is sequentially transformed by neural circuits to generate meaningful perception. This work will both address longstanding mysteries about the inner workings of the olfactory system, and reveal general principles that govern how the brain organizes and processes information.",Cracking the Olfactory Code,9814744,U19NS112953,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Frequencies', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sense Organs', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic manipulation', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging approach', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'neural circuit', 'new technology', 'novel', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory receptor', 'olfactory stimulus', 'optogenetics', 'piriform cortex', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'stimulus processing', 'theories', 'working group']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U19,2019,2774000,-0.016436082468156823
"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment.",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,9743002,UH3NS103550,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Resistance', 'Scalp structure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'antidepressant effect', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'connectome', 'control trial', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'implantation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'patient population', 'response', 'support tools', 'targeted biomarker', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'white matter']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,UH3,2019,1262523,0.016006855917989175
"Neurocognitive deficits and compensation in binge drinkers ABSTRACT  Binge or heavy episodic drinking has been on the rise and is associated with a range of harmful consequences that scale up with the high intensity drinking prevalent among young adults. Evidence on the nature and extent of neural changes associated with binge drinking (BD) is scant, especially as regards sex differences, so more sensitive, high-precision imaging modalities are needed to examine persistent brain alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based methods are sensitive to brain function, as well as different neural tissue properties, and are well suited to provide multidimensional insight into the structure and organization of the brain. Despite a paucity of neuroimaging studies in BD, evidence obtained from individuals with alcohol use disorder suggests that degradation of prefrontal functions may contribute to impaired executive functions and an inability to refrain from hazardous drinking. Consistent with findings in alcohol use disorder, our data and other evidence indicate that BD participants show compensatory engagement of additional brain areas to maintain adequate performance on cognitively demanding tasks. Complementary MRI modalities can reveal the nature and regional specificity of structural degradation that underlies and constrains the compensatory reorganization.  The overall aim of this project is to use a range of MRI-based methods to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult binge drinking men and women. Because of their spatial precision and sensitivity to different neural tissue properties and functional features, MRI-based methods can provide insights into structural and functional alterations at the level of an interactive system. Specifically, BOLD fMRI will evaluate functional activation during tasks that probe cognitive control; resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis will examine alterations at the level of a functional network, while structural degradation will be reflected in gray and white matter morphometric features. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will characterize white matter microstructure and tract-based changes. These measures will be obtained from young adult men and women (18-30 yrs) who will be assigned to binge drinking (BD) and light drinking (LD) groups based on their drinking patterns and will be equated on age, race/ethnicity, and family history of alcoholism. Interactions between binge drinking and sex will be examined in all analyses. Overall, we hypothesize that neural alterations will correlate with a range of alcohol-related variables, with greater deficits and increased compensatory activity observed in BDs who engage in higher intensity drinking, with BD women being especially susceptible to functional deficits and structural degradation. Data will be integrated across imaging modalities in a machine learning classifier framework that will inform a predictive model of drinking trajectories based on 6-mos and 12-mos longitudinal follow-ups. Combined with a rich set of drinking indices, personality and behavioral variables, a constellation of brain measures will provide a mechanistic insight into the type and extend of the neural degradation underlying executive deficits and compensatory brain reorganization. NARRATIVE  The overall aim of this project is to use a multimodal MRI approach to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult men and women engaging in binge drinking.

"Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication Project Summary/Abstract: Processing acoustic communication signals is among the most difficult yet vital abilities of the auditory system. These abilities lie at the heart of language and speech processing, and their success or failure has profound impacts on quality of life across the lifespan. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, and for improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders, such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. Non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans reveal the loci of language-related processing but do not answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. Thus, circuit-level neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing remain poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language. This proposal investigates neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing abilities shared between songbirds and humans. In Aim 1, we test the cellular-level predictions of a powerful modelling framework, called predictive coding, proposed as a general computational mechanism to support the learned recognition of complex temporally patterned signals at multiple timescales. We combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods with multi-electrode electrophysiology, to test explicit models for natural stimulus representation, prediction, and error coding in single cortical neurons and neural populations. One aspect of auditory perception integral to speech is the discretization of the signal into learned categorically perceived sounds (phonemes). In Aim 2, we use the predictive coding framework to investigate the learned categorical perception of natural auditory categories in populations of cortical neurons. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent phonemes can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Aim2 also examines how categorical neural representations are affected by temporal context. In addition to which phonemes occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Songbirds also attend to the statistical regularities in their vocal communication signals. In Aim 3, we focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication,9803507,R01DC018055,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'bird song', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'pattern perception', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,334599,-0.07547705020343878
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9735214,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'data warehouse', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'summer internship', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2019,268961,-0.001964529066902724
"An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms An intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) is used to record electrical signals directly from a person's brain, predict their intention from those signals, then control an assistive device (e.g., a computer cursor, prosthetic limb, or powered wheelchair) according to those intentions. This technology enables severely paralyzed people to interact with the world. However, designing robust algorithms to extract intent from recordings of single neurons is extremely challenging, in large part because of the very limited access to humans, or even monkeys, from whom these invasive recordings can be made. In this project, we will develop a model iBCI system that generates real-time biomimetic neural data by capturing the high-degree-of-freedom finger movements of able-bodied human subjects. To accomplish this, we will construct a modular recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN will be trained to predict the motor cortex activity of a monkey from the monkey's own finger kinematics. Small modules of the RNN will be interchanged according the particular animal or recording session to model the high inter-session variability present in motor cortex. Once the modular RNN is trained, its weights will be fixed and human finger kinematics will be used as the RNN inputs, which will generate subject-controlled emulated neural activity. The emulated neural activity can be passed to iBCI decoding algorithms that control computer cursors or other physical devices, allowing human subjects to interact directly with decoders in real time, closed-loop conditions. We call this model system the jaBCI. The jaBCI is low cost and noninvasive, making it possible to rapidly test and design novel iBCI decoders using statistically rigorous sample sizes. The project will be executed in close collaboration with intracortical microelectrode array data expert Dr. Lee Miller at Northwestern University. Dr. Miller's lab, with the help of our consultant Dr. Mathis, will obtain simultaneous finger kinematics and neural activity of monkey subjects that will serve as the training data for the RNN component of the iBCI model. We will validate the emulated neural data generated by the jaBCI across many measures to ensure the model captures as many features of intracortical data as possible. These include comparing the model and actual iBCI in subject performance, learning rates, control strategies, neural variation across days, neural firing rate distributions, and low-dimensional neural dynamics. With the validated model, we will undertake a study to rigorously evaluate the highest performing, current state-of-the-art iBCI decoders. This will yield useful insight into the features of decoders that yield the greatest performance gains, overcoming the current impossibility to compare iBCI decoders in well-controlled studies using more than two or three naïve human subjects. We will also use the iBCI model to evaluate novel decoder designs, and to determine the features of neural dynamics that are consistent across common iBCI tasks to help focus decoder development on those features. Narrative Brain-computer interfaces are systems that translate the electrical neural signatures of thought into instructions for a personal computer or powered wheelchair, which is an incredibly useful technology to help paralyzed people regain some independence and ability to communicate. This work would develop a tool that scientists can use to design, test, and optimize the sophisticated computer programs that translate brain signals into device instructions without having to implant electrodes into a person's brain until the program is completed and rigorously tested. This tool could increase the pace of discovery and development of brain-computer interfaces.",An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms,9817780,R01NS109257,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biological Models', 'Biomimetics', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Finger joint structure', 'Fingers', 'Freedom', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Industry Standard', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Cortex', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operating System', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Personal Power', 'Persons', 'Posture', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Robotics', 'Rotation', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'brain computer interface', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer program', 'cost', 'design', 'finger movement', 'head-to-head comparison', 'high dimensionality', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'innovation', 'insight', 'invention', 'kinematics', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'skill acquisition', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,367007,0.0151724682343367
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need.

"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD,9730653,R01NS100849,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction Time', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,75097,-0.024445663694040422
"Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant processing of social and affective information is a severe and disabling symptom across many neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent reports demonstrate that direct electrical brain stimulation (EBS) can alter perception, such as changing the identity of a person being viewed or causing memory-related hallucinations. If EBS can distort normal perception, then EBS using different parameters may be able to normalize SAP, for example by modulating affective salience to visual stimuli in PTSD. One key impediment towards developing EBS as a therapy for SAP pathology is that we lack an understanding of how electrical stimulation modulates neurodynamics and cognition. A critical step towards designing rational EBS-based stimulation parameters for SAP pathology is building a causal model of the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics, interregional interactions, and EBS modulation of these dynamics and interactions during SAP. Visual SAP relies on a neural circuit in the temporal lobe that includes the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Non-invasive brain imaging techniques either lack the temporal resolution to examine millisecond dynamics (fMRI/PET), or are relatively insensitive to activity in deep brain structures such as the amygdala (MEG/EEG/TMS). Direct neural recordings using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy will allow us to overcome these barriers to study the dynamics and interactions in the SAP circuit. Furthermore, delivery of EBS via these implanted electrodes will allow us to examine how electrical modulation of this circuit alters SAP. Using iEEG and advanced analysis methods from machine learning, we recently delineated the set of information processing stages that FG goes through for face perception. In this project, we will test a three- stage dynamic model of the sequence of events and interregional interactions that enable SAP based on these previous results, the work of others, and our preliminary data. We will record iEEG in our regions of interest to test neural dynamics during three critical aspects of social affective processing: perception of facial expression (Aim 1), the inference of actions from motion (Aim 2), and guiding conscious perception to affectively and socially salient stimuli (Aim 3). Then we will employ EBS to modulate perception during these processes. In addition, we will supplement iEEG with magnetoencephalography (MEG), which, while less sensitive to amygdala activity, provides whole-brain cortical coverage and facilitates the comparison of iEEG results to a normative population. The outcome of the proposed research will be a spatially and temporally specific model of the causal dynamics and interactions during SAP. This model will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted EBS therapies that may normalize pathological SAP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Abnormalities in social affective perception are a critical part of the etiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The proposed research will map the detailed neurodynamics of critical aspects of social affective perception and examine how these neurodynamics, and the associated cognitions, can be modulated by brain stimulation. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of social affective perception, a circuit relevant to a number of mental disorders, and take a critical step towards determining how brain stimulation may be used to remediate pathological social affective perception.","Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation",9707904,R01MH107797,"['Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anger', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Body Image', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Perception', 'Feedback', 'Form Perception', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Social Perception', 'Social Processes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'encephalography', 'evidence base', 'face perception', 'healthy volunteer', 'information processing', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,446302,-0.022470223970589134
"Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroscience is producing increasingly complex data sets, including measures and manipulations of sub- cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular mechanisms operating over multiple timescales and in the context of different behaviors and task conditions. These data sets pose several fundamental challenges. First, for a given data set, what are the relevant spatial, temporal, and computational scales in which the underlying information-processing dynamics are best understood? Second, what are the best ways to design and select models to account for these dynamics, given the inevitably limited, noisy, and uneven spatial and temporal sampling used to collect the data? Third, what can increasingly complex data sets, collected under increasingly complex conditions, tells us about how the brain itself processes complex information? The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate new, theoretically grounded methods to help researchers to overcome these challenges. Our primary hypothesis is that resolving, modeling, and interpreting relevant information- processing dynamics from complex data sets depends critically on approaches that are built upon understanding the notion of complexity itself. A key insight driving this proposal is that definitions of complexity that come from different fields, and often with different interpretations, in fact have a common mathematical foundation. This common foundation implies that different approaches, from direct analyses of empirical data to model fitting, can extract statistical features related to computational complexity that can be compared directly to each other and interpreted in the context of ideal-observer benchmarks. Starting with this idea, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish a common theoretical foundation for analyzing both data and model complexity; 2) develop practical, complexity-based tools for data analysis and model selection; and 3) establish the usefulness of complexity-based metrics for understanding how the brain processes complex information. Together, these Aims provide new theoretical and practical tools for understanding how the brain integrates information across large temporal and spatial scales, using formal, universal definitions of complexity to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of complex neural and behavioral data sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will establish new, theoretically grounded computational tools to help neuroscience researchers design and analyze studies of brain function. These tools, which will be made widely available to the neuroscience research community, will help support a broad range of studies of the brain, enhance scientific discovery, and promote rigor and reproducibility.","Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience",9789280,R01EB026945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'design', 'information processing', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,21171,0.004498589429478833
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled. PROJECT NARRATIVE The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques as well as automatic clustering approaches based on quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution.

"CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations Throughout the brain, specialized systems carry out different but complementary functions, sometimes  independently but often in cooperation. However, we do not understand how their activity is dynamically  coordinated, and dysregulation of this is associated with many mental health conditions. Neuronal oscillations, which are detectable in local field potentials (LFPs) at various frequencies, are a promising  target for this coordination. Gamma oscillations (40-100 Hz) in particular have been singled out since they enhance stimulus responses, facilitate interactions between brain regions, and are expressed ubiquitously across cortical and subcortical regions. Indeed, gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral  nucleus of the amygdala (BL), an important regulator of emotional behaviors. BL gamma oscillations are  enhanced during periods of heightened vigilance during a foraging task, following emotionally salient experiences, and upon presentation of socially-relevant stimuli. The variety of circumstances that engage  it make it a promising target for interventions affecting emotional behaviors in general. However, technical challenges abound because gamma manifests as brief intermittent oscillatory bursts, layered atop numerous ongoing activities in other frequency bands. This precludes manipulating gamma exclusively with traditional pharmacological, optogenetic, or chemogenetic approaches, since these have substantial  effects on ongoing non-gamma activities, and are delivered irrespective of whether gamma bursts are present or absent. To overcome this, a closed-loop algorithm was developed that monitors the LFP in  real-time for gamma oscillations and delivers precisely timed optogenetic stimulation capable of enhancing or suppressing gamma strength on a cycle-by-cycle basis. While this improves upon the status  quo,, further refinement is needed. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to clarify how the gamma modulation technique operates via biophysically detailed modeling of the local circuits in the BL that generate gamma, the effects of optogenetic stimulation, and the closed-loop algorithm. Aim 2 designs better signal  processing routines for detecting and parameterizing gamma in real-time. Aim 3 develops an approach to  create customized biophysical models that reproduce the properties of gamma observed in individual  subjects, which when combined with the results of Aims 1 and 2 should allow for optimized control over gamma oscillations in individual subjects. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region implicated in emotional regulation.  By developing improved methods to manipulate these oscillations, we hope to better understand their  function and improve our ability to control emotional states and behaviors. n/a",CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations,9914633,R01MH122023,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Emotional', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rodent Model', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'biophysical model', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional behavior', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'vigilance']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2019,297755,-0.0052760095221160855
"Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging Project Summary. Neuroimaging is poised to take a substantial leap forward in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of human behavior, due to a combination of improved analytic techniques and the quality of imaging data. These advances are allowing researchers to develop population-level multivariate models of the functional brain representations underlying behavior, performance, clinical status and prognosis, and other outcomes. Population-based models can identify patterns of brain activity, or `signatures', that can predict behavior and decode mental states in new individuals, producing generalizable knowledge and highly reproducible maps. These signatures can capture behavior with large effect sizes, and can be used and tested across research groups. However, the potential of such signatures is limited by neuroanatomical constraints, in particular individual variation in functional brain anatomy. To circumvent this problem, current models are either applied only to individual participants, severely limiting generalizability, or force participants' data into anatomical reference spaces (atlases) that do not respect individual functional topology and boundaries. Here we seek to overcome this shortcoming by developing new topological models for inter-subject alignment, which register participants' functional brain maps to one another. This will increase effective spatial resolution, and more importantly allow us to explicitly analyze the spatial topology of functional maps make inferences on differences in activation location and shape across persons and psychological states. We will test and validate the methods using a purpose-designed experiment (n = 120) that includes two types of naturalistic narrative experiences (movies and audio stories) and tasks from three functional domains (pain, emotion, and cognition). The tasks are designed with several constraints in mind, including: (1) systematic coverage of cognitive, emotional, and sensory tasks matched in stimulus properties (e.g., stimulus duration); and (2) multiple levels of task demand within each task, to permit parametric modeling and prediction of demand levels. We will compare our new methods to existing methods based on out-of-sample effect sizes in predicting behavior and test-retest reliability. We will make the analytic methods, software, and dataset available to other researchers, along with a library of functional reference spaces for multiple psychological states. Project Narrative. We develop new methods for enhancing the development of models that can predict behavior, clinical status, and other outcomes using neuroimaging data. Successful development will help improve the translational impact of neuroimaging. It will also contribute to developing multidisciplinary neuroscience, by promoting the development of neural signatures for specific mental processes in humans with increased precision and specificity.",Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging,9747296,R01EB026549,"['Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Charon', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gaussian model', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Processes', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Wages', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'mental state', 'model development', 'movie', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'statistics', 'translational impact']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,692050,-0.007962479405987077
"RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data Project Summary/Abstract  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allows the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded. We use the term ECOG to refer to the entire range of invasive recording techniques (from subdural strips and grids to penetrating electrodes) that share the common attribute of recording neural activity from the human brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. While this ability has resulted in many high-impact advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain function in health and disease, it generates staggering amounts of data as a single patient can be implanted with hundreds of electrodes, each sampled thousands of times a second for hours or even days. The difficulty of exploring these vast datasets is the rate-limiting step in using them to improve human health. We propose to overcome this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the unique properties of ECOG. We dub this software tool RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).  The first goal of Aim 1 is to release RAVE 1.0 to the entire ECOG community by month 6 of the first funding period. This will maximize transformative impact by putting the new tools in the hands of users as quickly as possible, facilitating rapid adoption. The design philosophy of RAVE is driven by three imperatives. The first is to keep users ""close to the data"" so that users may make discoveries about the brain without being misled by artifacts. The second imperative is rigorous statistical methodology. The final imperative is ""play well with others"". As described in Aim 2, our approach will make it easy to seamlessly incorporate new and existing analysis tools written in Matlab, C++, Python or R into RAVE, giving users the best of both worlds: advanced but easy-to-use visualization of results from ECOG experiments, whether they are analyzed with the off-the- shelf tools routines provided with RAVE or novel tools developed by others.

"Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion PROJECT SUMMARY Little is known about the neural mechanisms that regulate natural dynamic cues during human social and emotional interactions, although these mechanisms are impaired in many psychiatric and neurological disorders. Although it is widely understood that social signals such as facial expressions carry salient, but implicit, emotional and social cues, these “real-time” pathways have not been investigated with dual-brain neuroimaging techniques. This unmet need is largely due to technological limitations that prevent neuroimaging of two or more individuals during natural interactive situations. We overcome this technical “roadblock” with recent advances in an emerging human brain imaging technology, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This non-invasive technique detects active neural tissue based on hemodynamic signals measured by variations in the absorption spectra associated with oxyhemoglobin and de-oxyhemoglobin. Because detectors and emitters are surface mounted on the head, absent a high magnetic field, they are relatively insensitive to head movement and thus successfully applied to dyadic experiments. The focus of this proposal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie dynamic cross-brain neural coupling during real interpersonal interactions. Cross-brain neural coupling is defined as the correlation between the temporal patterns of the signals of two brains. It has been proposed that these matched patterns represent shared neural processes including dynamic exchanges of information. However, the basic assumptions of shared information and temporal resonance patterns between specific brain-to-brain regions has not been tested. We pioneer tests of these hypothesis using eye-to-eye contact as a metric of shared information and predict that dynamic neural coupling between the two brains will increase with increasing numbers of eye-to-eye contact events. Mimicry of facial expressions is also a metric of emotional contagion as well as shared information between brains. We further test the hypothesis that neural coupling will increase with the level of mimicry also by virtue of the shared information Confirmation of the hypothesis that neural coupling represents shared information between the two brains would provide a singular advance for understanding mechanisms for dynamic interactions. Both approaches include variations of emotive expressions to test the additional hypothesis that content as well as shared information might influence dynamic coupling mechanisms. Findings from these studies are expected to open a new direction for the study of live and dynamic interactions between individuals, and provide foundational components to a general framework for models of face-to-face interactions. A long-term goal is to understand the neural underpinnings of affective disorders as they present in clinically-relevant and real-world situations. Project Narrative How do two brains interact? We pioneer a novel neuroimaging technology, near infrared spectroscopy, to investigate basic mechanisms of neural coupling between two dynamically interacting individuals. Using these new methods we test the fundamental hypothesis that neural coupling (temporal synchrony between two brains) represents shared information across the two brains.",Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion,9711359,R01MH119430,"['Affective', 'Arousal', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Eyebrow structure', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Negative Valence', 'Oral cavity', 'Oxyhemoglobin', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smiling', 'Social Interaction', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'contagion', 'detector', 'dyadic interaction', 'emotional reaction', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'magnetic field', 'mimicry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,405576,0.00024513082992808977
"Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis Understanding the function of the nervous system requires a sophisticated understanding of its main output, behavior. Although our ability to record from and to manipulate neurons and neural circuits has accelerated at a spectacular pace over the last decade, progress has lagged in coupling the interrogation of the nervous system to similarly high-resolution measures of behavior. As a consequence, we lack a sophisticated understanding of how the brain composes, modifies and controls action.  We have recently developed a transformative behavioral characterization technology called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), which circumvents many of the limitations imposed by typical approaches to behavioral measurement (e.g., overtraining, head-fixation, limited behavioral flexibility). This analytical system works by capturing comprehensive and continuous morphometric data about the three-dimensional (3D) posture of a mouse as it freely behaves. The 3D data are then analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify patterns of motion that correspond to stereotyped and reused modules of sub-second behavior (which by analogy to natural language we refer to as behavioral “syllables”). The output of this fitting procedure is a parts list for behavior: a limited set of syllables out of which the rodent creates all of its observable action. In addition, within any given experiment MoSeq identifies the specific transition structure (or “grammar”) that places individual syllables into sequences; these sequences encode all patterns of spontaneous behavior expressed by an animal in a given experimental context. We have recently combined this behavioral assessment technology with techniques for neural recording, allowing us to assess the relationship between neural activity in behaviorally-relevant circuits and patterns of action. This combined approach allowed us, for example, to identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics in striatum; importantly, these observed correlations validate MoSeq as a technology that enables accurate inference of internal states from external states. However, the code that underlies MoSeq is essentially bespoke, inappropriate for distribution, and difficult for all but expert users to navigate. In addition, implementing MoSeq in its current form requires extensive prior mathematical and computational experience, limiting its use to a small set of users with specialized skills. Here we propose Aims to democratize MoSeq by (1) transforming it into an end-to-end pipeline that can be easily used by graduate-student level neuroscientists with minimal expertise, and which can be modified on an ongoing basis to accommodate improvements to MoSeq and (2) to offer hands-on training in the set-up and appropriate use of MoSeq for characterizing behavior and neural-behavioral relationships. Together these aims will create a vibrant community of MoSeq users; the creation of such a group has the potential to transform the way behavior is analyzed across neuroscience, and promises to lead to broad insights into the many and varied relationships between neural circuits and behavior. A central goal of neurobiology is to reveal how the brain generates and organizes action, but we lack sophisticated tools for objectively and comprehensively characterizing behavior. We have developed a next- generation method called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) that affords unprecedented insight into how the brain organizes behavior; however, using this approach requires substantial expertise, which has slowed its adoption by the scientific community. Here we propose to streamline and package the underlying code, and to offer hands-on training, so that users without extensive computer science or math backgrounds can easily use MoSeq to characterize animal behavior as part of efforts to understand how genes, drugs or neural activity changes action.","Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis",9654850,U24NS109520,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Dimensions', 'Educational workshop', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'data format', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'graphical user interface', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'natural language', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'next generation', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'skills', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'voltage', 'web services']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U24,2019,455655,-0.044865668461670186
"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains).

"Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks. Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy, which affects nearly 4% of the population over their lifetime, roughly one third of afflicted patients are incompletely responsive to anticonvulsant drugs, requiring in severe cases neurosurgical resections or novel approaches such as deep-brain stimulation (DBS). Recently, I helped develop an electrophysiology-based online DBS protocol for seizure detection and interruption in rodent models of absence epilepsy, a form of epilepsy involving aberrant thalamocortical activity. However, like other online DBS procedures which detect seizures as they occur, there was little ability to predict incipient seizures due in large part to limited spatiotemporal resolution of the signal we used, the electrocorticogram (ECoG). ECoG and related electroencephalogram (EEG), being large scale local field potential approaches, do not provide single-cell resolution of neural dynamics that are likely required to obtain predictive information. Over the last decade, the field of brain-machine interface (BMI) has made breakthroughs in neuroscience and engineering by developing methods for multi-electrode array recording of large scale neural spiking activity and efficient reduction of the resultant high-dimensional neural activity to a smaller number of dimensions to effectively control neural prostheses. We predict that this approach will be invaluable for understanding neural dynamics during seizures and stimulation, and for developing predictive algorithms and adaptive DBS protocols.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to precisely characterize thalamocortical neural activity during spontaneous absence seizures and following thalamic stimulation by combining large-scale thalamic and cortical neural recordings, optogenetics, and BMI mathematical techniques. Additionally, the experiments presented in this proposal will use the recorded neural activity to develop adaptive algorithms that both predict oncoming seizure activity and modify stimulation parameters based on the neural state and response to stimulation in real-time. This proposal is aimed towards increasing our understanding of the neural dynamics of epileptic networks and improving the efficacy and safety of online DBS. Roughly one third of epileptic patients are resistant to pharmacological treatment, which has promoted the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a means to detect and prevent seizures. However, the neural activity underlying epileptic discharges and the effects of DBS on this activity are poorly understood, partially due to the limited information carried by the EEG signals used for monitoring seizures. A more precise characterization of epileptic neural circuits is crucial to improve current DBS design and enhance the sensitivity and efficacy of seizure detection and disruption, which demands the tools and resources of basic research.",Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks.,9604827,F31NS100265,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Generalized seizures', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'markov model', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,33104,0.01970950349744672
"Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation ABSTRACT Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and more than 5 million people worldwide. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an effective treatment for the motor signs of PD. However, DBS is often limited by partial efficacy, side effects, and long and difficult clinical visits to identify and program therapeutic stimulation settings. Additionally, PD symptoms fluctuate from moment-to-moment depending on a multitude of factors, and therefore the demand for stimulation (or medication) changes throughout the day. There is a clear need for automated, individualized DBS programming strategies that can both reduce programming time and adapt to deliver optimal stimuli as each patient's symptoms fluctuate. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the quality of life for PD patients by providing them with an intelligent, adaptive, closed-loop DBS algorithm. In Aim 1, we propose to create a closed-loop DBS algorithm in silico that can learn from and adapt to electro-physiological signatures of parkinsonian states in order to deliver optimal, patient- specific stimulation. The algorithm will be built upon the framework of reinforcement learning, which has several desirable properties that make it ideally suited for use in a closed-loop DBS algorithm. Given a biomarker for parkinsonian severity and a set of possible actions, the algorithm will autonomously learn how to deliver stimulus to reduce the biomarker and therefore PD symptoms. Preliminary results shown in this proposal suggest that the algorithm is able to learn complex actions without a priori knowledge, and can help to control a selected biomarker. In Aim 2, we propose to test out the algorithm in a large animal model of PD with high-density DBS arrays that have been shown to enable more advanced current steering and higher resolution local field potential recordings. We will then apply the algorithm and compare its performance to continuous DBS in terms of effects on individual parkinsonian motor signs as well as the electrophysiological signal targeted by the algorithm. This project will not only provide a means to critically evaluate putative biomarkers of DBS therapy for alleviating parkinsonian motor signs, but also provide a much more versatile and powerful closed-loop algorithm for use in titrating DBS therapy for individuals with Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders amenable to deep brain stimulation therapy. As a result of this project, we will create a closed-loop DBS algorithm that can help improve the quality of life for Parkinson's disease patients. NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and while dopamine replacement medication is well established for alleviating many of the motor symptoms of PD, but deep brain stimulation (DBS) is often indicated, in conjunction with medication as the disease progresses. One of the significant challenges with DBS is patient-specific dosimetry of stimulation settings to efficiently achieve a strong and consistent therapeutic effect. This project will develop an innovative reinforcement learning algorithm that autonomously learns which stimulation settings are most effective at reducing parkinsonian motor signs based on closed-loop feedback of oscillatory activity within the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus using high-density electrode arrays.",Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,9762992,F31NS103487,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'E-learning', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurotoxins', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'computational network modeling', 'deep brain stimulation array', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'density', 'dosimetry', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'investigator training', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor symptom', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'side effect', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2019,30689,0.01648624317142221
"Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control Project Summary/Abstract  Millions of people suffer from some form of paralysis. In most of these cases the connection between the brain and the spinal cord is damaged, however, the motor cortex is healthy and intact. Thus, for these individuals, brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) hold significant promise for improving quality of life. BMIs decode an individual's intention to move by utilizing statistical models of neural activity patterns recorded from the motor cortex using implanted electrode arrays. While these methods have been encouraging in preclinical experiments and clinical trials for controlling thought-driven 2D computer cursors, they suffer from poor performance when applied to higher degrees-of-freedom (e.g., robotic limbs), and are not robust to the inevitable degradation of the electrode array. In order to address these clinical needs, this project starts from the recent observation that just as some behaviors are easier to learn, some patterns of neural activity, termed neural states, are also easier to generate. The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate if these “easy to generate” neural states can be used to robustly control a prosthetic arm. This is a significant departure from current decoding methods, which incorporate little to no information about the motor system, especially its ability to learn and adapt. The first major aim of this work is to develop experiments and analysis methods in order to find these “easy to generate” neural states in the non- human primate (i.e., rhesus monkey) motor system. Here “easy to generate” can be understood as the monkey's ability to volitionally generate that particular neural state. The second major aim of this work is to characterize the properties of the motor system that enable some states to be more easily generated than others. Prior work in our lab has shown that motor cortical population activity has well-defined structure, as predicted by dynamical system theory. These dynamics cause neural states to evolve in lawful ways through time. The work here will extend these findings by characterizing the dynamics associated with a monkey learning to generate a neural state. Finally, the third major aim of this work is to determine if neural states that monkeys can volitionally generate can be utilized for robust control of a prosthetic arm. The central hypothesis of this work is that building a model that only utilizes firing patterns that can be easily generated (as determined experimentally) will enable robust and high-performance control of a prosthetic arm. If successful, this study could have significant clinical impact by presenting a new paradigm to enable robust control of a prosthesis. Project Narrative  Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injuries or neurodegenerative diseases that result in considerable movement impairment. Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) hold considerable promise in drastically improving the quality of life for these individuals, who otherwise have very limited treatment options. This work will investigate the motor system's ability to learn and adapt, and directly use these insights to build robust high degree-of-freedom BMIs for clinical applications.",Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control,9765066,F31NS103409,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Arm', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation device', 'Robotics', 'Spinal Cord', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Volition', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'brain machine interface', 'clinical application', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'motor impairment', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'pre-clinical', 'prosthesis control', 'rehearsal', 'relating to nervous system']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,34556,-0.000735073000374432
"Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method of focally stimulating the brain that uses electromagnetic induction and does not require surgery. There is optimism that TMS will revolutionize how we treat neurological and psychiatric disorders, evidenced by over 1000 clinical trials registered using TMS. Much of this optimism stems from the successful use of TMS as a treatment for depression. Despite the large number of clinical trials using TMS the number of therapeutic indications has been stagnant, limited to major depression and more recently obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are fundamental questions about the underlying mechanisms of action for TMS that will be critical to understand in order to advance this treatment modality. Here, we propose a unique collaborative project between neurology and neurosurgery that will allow an unprecedented window into understanding how TMS impacts the human brain. Specifically, we will perform TMS in neurosurgical patients with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) monitoring to record real time effects of TMS on local and remote brain areas with an unparalleled combination of spatial and temporal resolution relative to other human studies. We have already demonstrated the safety of this approach using a gel-based phantom brain and have results from seven patients demonstrating safety and preliminary results. For the current proposal we aim to: 1) characterize the response of TMS on the human brain as recorded from iEEG between active and sham conditions, and 2) relate remote electrophysiological responses induced by TMS to measures of brain connectivity between the stimulation and recording sites assessed with resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI). This will allow us to evaluate the relationship between TMS-evoked iEEG responses and the strength of functional connectivity to the stimulation site in a regression model. We hypothesize that: 1) TMS will have focal effects detected from surface electrodes underlying the stimulation site as well as network-level engagement detected at remote sites, 2) Repetitive TMS will induce frequency- specific effects that differ between 0.5 and 10 Hz stimulation protocols, and 3) the magnitude of repetitive TMS-evoked iEEG responses across electrodes will relate to the strength of rs-fcMRI between the stimulation and recording sites. By investigating the electrophysiological responses of TMS with high spatiotemporal precision in humans, this study will provide new mechanistic insights into the effects of TMS on target engagement and relate these findings to imaging methods already in widespread use. Moreover, the TMS will be applied in a clinically meaningful way by targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a protocol used to treat depression. Generating results for these aims will be key to advancing our understanding of how TMS engages brain networks, which can be leveraged to rationally develop personalized, imaging-guided therapeutic TMS for depression and other disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will help our understanding of how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) affects the brain. We will develop a new method of measuring TMS-induced changes in brain activity with high spatial and temporal accuracy that is only possible with intracranial recording. The research will shed light on the mechanism of TMS and facilitate the development of better interventions and treatments for psychiatric diseases.",Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans,9805657,R21MH120441,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurology', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cranium', 'field study', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optimism', 'programs', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'stem', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2019,231750,0.013906905950841337
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9634046,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ferrets', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,327250,-0.0008197045907918115
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9707897,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,641907,0.020963974872952734
"CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits Despite substantial progress characterizing neural responses, it is particularly challenging to determine  causal interactions within recurrently connected circuits due to the confounding influence of the  interconnections. This proposed project pioneers a nascent field of closed-loop computational neuroscience that enables real-time feedback stimulation during experiments to decouple recurrently connected elements and make stronger causal inferences about their interactions. Specifically, the  contributions of this project will include: Aim 1) Using modern unsupervised machine learning methods to fit latent state dynamical system models of population responses under closed-loop stimulation. The  developed techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in genetically targeted inhibitory interneurons  across S 1 cortical laminae in the mouse to map the causal effect of inhibitory cells on the sensory gain in  excitatory cells. Aim 2) Merging and extending tools from network feedback control and causal inference  to identify functional connections between network nodes using realistic experimental constraints. These  techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in different S1 laminae of the mouse, using distributed  perturbations to identify the functional connectivity between microcircuit layers during sensory stimulation.  Aim 3) Developing a large-scale computational modeling environment to serve as an in si\ico testbed for the community.  Significance: The proposed project changes the de facto standard use of stimulation in experiments to  leverage the full power of new recording and s.timulation technology for decoupling recurrently connected  variables and making stronger causal inferences.  Broader impacts: While the project uses rodent somatosensation as a model system, the results of this  project will provide new techniques to study neurologic disorders involving disfunction of recurrent circuits  (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and depression). The open-source implementations will constitute  critical algorithmic infrastructure for closed-loop stimulation experiments. This project will also result in the  production of new trainees in an emerging new interdisciplinary field of closed-loop computational neuroscience. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The neural circuits that fail in many neurologic disorders (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and  depression) are difficult to study because they involve complex feedback loops. This project will develop  algorithms that combine measurements and stimulation in real-time to provide powerful new tools to  uncover the operating principles of these circuits and change their operation. Discovery in this area can  help improve understanding of neurologic disorders and development of new stimulation therapies. n/a",CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits,9916954,R01NS115327,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Closure by clamp', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Opsin', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Production', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventroposterior Medial Nucleus of the Thalamus', 'Vibrissae', 'awake', 'cell type', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'open source', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'real time model', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'technology development', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,325241,-0.03429394220944359
"Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in the United States, affecting 4% of all adults over the age of 40. For individuals whose motor symptoms are refractory to medication and significantly impair their daily living, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered to be the only bilateral therapeutic option. Despite recent advances in DBS technology, a significant portion of ET patients with DBS implants will receive inadequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads, while others will lose efficacy of the therapy after 1-2 years due in part to inflexible neurostimulator programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs and programming algorithms that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields within the brain, especially in cases where stimulation through a poorly placed DBS lead results in low-threshold side-effects. Our proposed study will integrate high-field magnetic resonance imaging, histological neurotracing of fiber pathways, computational modeling of DBS, and single-cell electrophysiology methods to further develop and experimentally-validate a novel semi-automated machine learning algorithm that facilitates hypothesis-driven determination of subject-specific neurostimulator settings through directional DBS leads. Specifically, we will: 1) identify the neural pathways involved in the reduction of action and postural tremor using directional DBS leads and a novel particle swarm optimization algorithm based on subject-specific anatomy; 2) quantify how tremor-related information is modulated on the single-cell, population, and network levels by therapeutic DBS in a preclinical large-animal model of harmline-induced tremor; and 3) investigate how therapeutic windows (i.e. the threshold difference between postural and action tremor abolishment and side effect emergence) change over time with human DBS therapy targeting one or more pathways within the cerebello-thalamoc-cortical network. Together, this project will (a) experimentally evaluate and translate a novel DBS programming algorithm to human ET patients, (b) provide a much more detailed map of the neural pathways underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS (on postural and action tremor) and side effects of DBS (on dysarthria, paresthesia, ataxia), (c) rigorously investigate how DBS for treating tremor works mechanistically at the single cell and network levels within the brain, and (d) probe the neural pathways involved in the worsening of tremor symptoms for ET patients over time. NARRATIVE Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a proven therapy for patients with medication-refractory essential tremor, but a significant portion of patients with these implants do not receive adequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads or inflexible DBS programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields in the brain to improve the functional outcome for all patients requiring DBS to manage their essential tremor. Our research study will experimentally evaluate a novel machine learning algorithm for programming directional DBS leads implanted within thalamus to more precisely identify and effectively target the pathways and circuits involved in (a) cessation of action and postural tremor, and (b) worsening of tremor symptoms over time.",Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor,9816407,R01NS081118,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Cerebellar cortex structure', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dysarthria', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Essential Tremor', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Harmaline', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intention Tremor', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Paresthesia', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Primates', 'Radiation', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tremor', 'United States', 'Utah', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'deep brain stimulation array', 'density', 'design', 'electric field', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic field', 'motor symptom', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'particle', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'research study', 'side effect', 'somatosensory', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'zona incerta']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,583682,-0.003459180928517467
"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,9789318,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2019,7509,-0.004651992469144229
"PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry Project Summary Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research, there has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. Such sharing, evaluation, and integration are necessary if computational modeling efforts are to be useful not only in generating reliable and accurate accounts of how brain subsystems operate, but also of how they interact to give rise to higher cognitive functions, and how disruptions of such interactions may give rise to disturbances of mental function observed in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This proposal seeks to meet this need by developing PsyNeuLink: an open source, Python-based software environment that makes it easy to create new models, import and/or re-implement existing ones, integrate these within a single software environment that will facilitate head-to-head comparison of comparable models, the assembly of complementary models into system-level models, and serve as a common repository for the documentation and dissemination of such models for both research and didactic purposes (i.e., publication, education, etc.). These goals will be pursued under two Specific Aims: 1) Extend the scope of modeling efforts that PsyNeuLink can accommodate by: i) enhancing its application programmer interface (API) used to add new components and interfaces to statistical analysis tools and other modeling environments (such as PyTorch, Emergent and ACT-R; ii) enriching its Library by adding PsyNeuLink implementations of influential models of neural subsystems; and iii) developing a publicly available workbook of simulation exercises as both an introduction to PsyNeuLink and for use in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry curricula. 2) Accelerate PsyNeuLink by developing a custom compiler that preserves its simplicity and flexibility, while dramatically increasing its speed, to make it suitable for simulation of large and complex system-level models, and for parameter estimation, model fitting, and model comparison. This project will exploit the power and accelerating use of Python, and modern just-in-time compilation methods to develop a tool designed specifically for the needs of systems-level Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry. This promises to open up new opportunities for research at the systems-level — a level of analysis that is crucial both for understanding how human mental function emerges from the interplay among neural subsystems, and how disturbances of individual neural subsystems impact this interplay, disruptions of which are almost certainly a critical factor in neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. This proposed project seeks to address this need by developing a standard software platform for the construction, documentation, sharing, and integration of computational models of brain function, that promises to accelerate the study of how system-level interactions give rise to mental function and, critically, the kinds of disruptions of such system-level interactions produced by disturbances of individual subsystems — disruptions that are sure to be a complex but critical factor in neurological and psychiatric disorders.",PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry,9824928,R21MH117548,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Perceptual learning', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Writing', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'flexibility', 'head-to-head comparison', 'improved', 'learning network', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'open source', 'parallelization', 'preservation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,253798,-0.014873470050858617
"Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex PROJECT SUMMARY Humans with normal hearing excel at deriving information about the world from sound. Our auditory abilities represent stunning computational feats that only recently have been replicated to any extent in machine systems. And yet our auditory abilities are highly vulnerable, being greatly compromised in listeners with hearing impairment, cochlear implants, and auditory neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in the presence of noise. Difficulties in recognition often lead to frustration and social isolation, and are not adequately addressed by current hearing aids, implants, and remediation strategies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to reveal the basis of auditory recognition and to provide insights that will facilitate improved prosthetic devices and therapeutic interventions. The development of more effective devices and therapies is currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the factors that underlie real-world recognition by normal-hearing listeners. In particular, although responses to sound in subcortical auditory pathways are relatively well studied, little is known about the transformations that occur within the auditory cortex to create representations of meaningful sound structure. We propose to enrich the understanding of auditory recognition with three sets of experiments that examine the cortical representation of real-world sounds in human listeners, combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling of the underlying representations. Aim 1 develops artificial neural network models of speech and music processing and compares their representations to those in the auditory cortex, synthesizing and then measuring brain responses to sounds that generate the same response in a model, and probing the time scale of the auditory analysis of speech and music. Aim 2 develops and tests models of pitch perception in noise, exploring the hypothesis that pitch perception is constrained both by the statistics of natural sounds and the frequency selectivity of the cochlea. Aim 3 develops and tests models that jointly localize and recognize sounds, and probes the brain representations of sound identity and location using fMRI. The results will reveal the mechanisms underlying robust sound recognition by the healthy auditory system and will set the stage for investigations of the cortical consequences of hearing impairment and auditory developmental disorders, hopefully suggesting new strategies for remediation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: People with normal hearing are typically able to recognize, understand and localize sounds of interest, but this ability is often compromised in listeners with hearing disorders. The proposed research will enrich the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying auditory recognition and localization in normal listeners. The results will likely provide insight into the brain processes whose alteration in hearing disorders underlies listening difficulties, potentially leading to improved remediation strategies.",Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex,9797408,R01DC017970,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Ear', 'Floor', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing Aids', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pitch Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Social isolation', 'Sound Localization', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Pathways', 'artificial neural network', 'auditory pathway', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'developmental disease', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'sound', 'sound frequency', 'speech processing', 'statistics']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,337875,-0.026480332888380868
"Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network The ability to learn and think about complex situations is central to a range of human cognitive functions, including navigation, reasoning, and decision making. Numerous theories across these domains rely on representations of states of these external and internal environments, but how they acquire such representations remains unknown. My overall goal is to understand how animals, including humans, can reason and learn in such complex environments. In this project, we propose to investigate how animals are able to learn these representations in a complex sequential decision making task in monkeys. Using a novel behavioral task inspired by the board game battleship, monkeys search for hidden shapes on a screen. There are millions of possible shapes, and yet monkeys are capable learners, vastly outperforming classic reinforcement learning algorithms. How monkeys can learn the shapes so quickly remains mysterious. In addition to these unknown computational foundations for learning, the neural mechanisms that support this behavior are also unexplored. Recent studies including electrophysiology and lesion research have found signatures of state representations in the amygdala (AMYG) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, these studies have only used very few states that only require associations to learn. Moreover, the interactions and computational roles of the regions have not been characterized. In light of these gaps in our understanding of learning in complex tasks, we will use the battleship task to elucidate 1) the aspects of the environment that drive learning representations of complex states, 2) the computational foundations of this learning using behavioral model fitting and deep neural networks, and 3) the neural mechanisms that underwrite this capacity in the AMYG-OFC circuit. We hypothesize that OFC represents hidden task states, those that cannot be fully defined in terms of perceptible stimuli and outcomes. We further hypothesize that AMYG plays a central role in learning and updating these representations by constructing an online representation of the current environment using input from OFC as well as from sensory processing and memory regions, representing current stimuli, outcomes, and associations. We posit an observer-critic architecture underlies learning representations of complex tasks, with AMYG activity computing and sending a teaching signal to OFC that learns and updates task state representations. As part of this planned research, I will be trained in advanced modeling and neural analysis techniques, and complete a course of study on the use of deep neural networks. This training will take place under the guidance of Dr. Stefano Fusi and Dr. C Daniel Salzman in the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. Despite broad relevance to understanding the mind, how people are able to learn and adapt to changes in their environments remains unknown. Numerous psychiatric dysfunctions as well as healthy neurotypical processes result in deficient ability to learn and update representations of complex, real-world situations. We will use electrophysiological techniques in nonhuman primates and advanced computational modeling to begin to investigate how people can so quickly learn and adapt to a complex world.",Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network,9754494,K99DA048748,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Behavioral Model', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decision Making', 'Drops', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visuospatial', 'Weight', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'deep neural network', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotransmission', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'theories']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2019,159052,-0.005511845347792179

"CRCNS: Real-time neural decoding for calcium imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Chen, Rong PROJECT DESCRIPTION A. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Real-time neural decoding centers on predicting behavior variables based on neural activity data, where the prediction is performed at a pace that reliably keeps up with the speed of the activity that is being monitored. Neuromodulation devices are becoming one of the most powerful tools for the treatment of brain disorders, enhancing neurocognitive performance, and demonstrating causality (Bergmann et al., 2016; Knotkova and Rasche, 2015). A precise neuromodulation system (Figure 1) integrates neural activity monitoring, real-time neural decoding, and neuromodulation. In precise neuromodulation, a decoding device predicts a behavior variable based on neural data streams in real-time. Based on the decoding results, neuromodulation parameters such as timing, frequency, duration, and amplitude are changed. Precise neuromodulation systems with closed-loop real-time feedback are superior to the fixed (open- loop) neuromodulation paradigm (Brocker et al., 2017; deBettencourt et al., 2015; Ezzyat et al., 2017). A recent direct brain stimulation study (Ezzyat et al., 2017) demonstrated significant advantages of precise neuromodulation over open-loop neuromodulation. Ezzyat et al. applied direct brain stimulation with decoding capability to patients with epilepsy to improve their memory. They found that stimulation increased memory function only if delivered when the decoding device indicated low encoding efficiency while stimulation decreased memory function if delivered when the decoding device indicated high encoding efficiency. An open-loop neuromodulation system with a fixed stimulation paradigm may not always facilitate memory function.  Miniature cellular imaging (Ghosh et al., 2011; Kerr and Nimmerjahn, 2012; Scott et al., 2013) is one of the most powerful ways to study neural circuits. It enables us to investigate neural circuits during behaviors for an understanding of network architecture of behavior, cognition, and emotion. Miniature cellular imaging records neuronal activity at cellular and sub-second levels of spatial and temporal resolution in freely moving animals. Miniature cellular imaging has many advantages. First, compared with in vivo multi-electrode recording, miniature calcium imaging can probe all cells in the field of view, and visualize the spatial location of monitored cells (Kerr et al., 2005). Second, compared with magnetic resonance imaging, which measures brain activity at the macroscopic scale and with low temporal resolution, miniature cellular imaging provides high spatial and temporal resolution. Third, fiber photometry (Cui et al., 2014) lacks cellular-level resolution, while miniature cellular imaging allows concurrent tracking of neural calcium activities at cellular spatial resolution.

"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9728374,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human model', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,381751,0.0021366945953712854
"Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks The mammalian brain is believed to be optimally designed for robust and adaptable computation of the sensory inputs from the world, with respect to both its hardware (network structure) and software (network dynamics). The precise connections between the intricate structural connectivity and the rich network dynamics, however, are yet unknown. Moreover, our understanding of how the network structure and dynamics shape (or are shaped by) underlying coding principles in the brain network, is limited. My research plan proposes to close this gap by leveraging rich dataset obtained by state-of-art experimental techniques at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and innovative mathematical methods.  Specifically, my project aims to 1) link network structure and dynamic information processing in the brain, and to 2) bridge the gap between detailed biophysiological mechanisms and overarching neural coding principles with a focus on predictive coding theory, using data-driven mathematical models. To address Aim 1, I will investigate how network dynamics measured by synchronizability, metastability, and integrated information depend on local and global structure of the network. I will then study whether the experimentally obtained mouse brain connectome has optimal connectivity structures for unique dynamical characteristics. These analyses will be extended to the cell-type and layer-specific brain connectivity, based on the latest Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity data obtained from Cre-transgenic mice. During the independent phase, I will investigate whether brain-like networks can be evolved from optimization of dynamic measures. Regarding Aim 2, I will analyze data obtained from my current collaborative project which experimentally tests predictive coding models in the mouse visual cortex. In this study, we measure neural activity in response to expected and unexpected sequences of natural stimuli across three hierarchically related areas. Upon completion of the experiments, during the mentored phase, I will investigate mapping of algorithmic units in predictive coding models to neuronal populations in different layers. During my independent career period, I will extend the predictive coding model to incorporate active sensing and thalamo-cortical circuitries.  The project during the mentored phase will be carried out at the University of Washington which provides a highly interdisciplinary environment and offers the ideal training for me to become an independent researcher. I will also have access to rich resources and outstanding collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. I will have two mentors, one from the University of Washington and another from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. This unique setup will allow me to study mathematical models based on experimental data obtained by cutting-edge techniques with guidance from mentors with strong theoretical backgrounds. With theories closely tied to experiments, I believe my proposed project will contribute to our understanding of the connection between structure and computation of the neuronal network, addressing BRAIN initiative’s high priorities. The proposed research aims to probe how adaptable sensory coding arises from intricate connectivity structure and dynamics of the brain network at multiple scales. This study will contribute to our understanding of connections between unique structure and dynamics of the brain network as well as the mapping of complex neuronal dynamics in the cortical circuitry to algorithmic nodes in predictive coding models. By combining cutting-edge experimental and theoretical tools, this project will contribute to identifying fundamental principles underlying emergence of cognition and perception from neuronal network dynamics.","Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks",9804370,K99EY030840,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive control', 'collaborative environment', 'connectome', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'object recognition', 'predictive test', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'theories', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,128619,-0.01553778742565975
"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9764342,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'machine vision', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2019,34022,-0.012916035396327767
"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions. The starting point of the project is our earlier discovery that phase structure in oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) of hippocampal areas CA1/CA3 carry location information in exquisite detail (Agarwal et al. 2014). We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations. The computational description level will leverage ideas of vector symbolic architectures, a class of connectionist models originally proposed for describing cognitive reasoning (Plate, 1995; Kanerva, 1996). Models produced by the software tool will concisely encapsulate assumptions about the computation and its implementation of a brain function and produce predictions that can be tested in a next generation of recording experiments. The proposed theory framework will be tested in building models for navigation in hippocampus and for visual processing in areas V1 and V4 in cortex. Project narrative: A key difficulty with inferring brain function from recordings of neural activity in a working brain is that the dynamics of individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Here we address this problem by delivering new tools for decoding and decomposing neural population activity, leveraging the recent discovery by the PI of behavior-specific phase structure of local field potentials. Further, we provide software and a theoretical framework for describing models of brain function on a computational and mechanistic level that can produce testable predictions for a new generation of brain recording experiments.",Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings,9789876,R01EB026955,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Encapsulated', 'Fostering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'area V1', 'area V4', 'base', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'independent component analysis', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'presynaptic', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'visual processing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,20717,-0.02118131522546729

Mark Richardson, MD, PhD, Department ofNeurologicaJ Surgery and Robert S. Turner, PhD, Department ofNeurobiology, University ofPittsburgh; Wolf-Julian Neumann, MD, and Andrea A. Kiihn, MD, Department ofNeurology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin. Co-Investigators: Benjamin Blankertz, PhD, Department of Computer Science, Technische Universitat Berlin; Tom Mitchell, PhD, Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon University. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 1 Introduction and Objectives  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) represents one of the major clinical breakthroughs in the age of translational neuroscience.1 In 1987, Benabid and colleagues demonstrated that high frequency stimulation can mimic the effects of ablative neurosurgery in Parkinson's disease (PD)2'3, while offering two key advantages to previous procedures: adjustability and reversibility. This project will employ artificial intelligence strategies, which have allowed for unprecedented innovations in translational, personalized, high-definition medicine4, to further elevate the therapeutic potential of DBS. By developing a computational framework for decoding behavioral and disease states from combined subthalamic and cortical population recordings, this work will inform future adaptive stimulation paradigms for PD and other movement disorders. The central aim is to develop a computational framework for deep learning- based multi-feature decoding of behavioral and disease states from electrocorticography (ECoG), in order to advance the evolution of aDBS. Proposed Research. The concurrent use ofresearch ECoG during DBS surgery recently has enabled basic neuroscience investigation ofhuman co11ical-subcortical network dynamics. The overall goal ofthis project is to establish intelligent algorithms to identify physiological and pathophysiological states in ECoG data that predict epochs during which stimulation would facilitate movement or reduce symptoms. Given that ECoG electrode strips can be implanted safely during DBS surge1y5·6, the use of ECoG for aDBS is hypothesized to have several advantages: 1. compatibility with any DBS electrode design; 2. optimal signal  to noise ratio, 3. customization of electrode implantation location, based on known network connectivity of the target nucleus; 4. potential implantation of multiple remote sensors in different brain regions. Several barriers, however, exi'st for advancing this type of strategy. Namely, neither instantaneous biomarkers, evidence for optimal recording locations, adaptive control algorithms, nor previous reports on the use of ECoG-based, adaptive DBS have been described in PD patients. These obstacles will be overcome through achieving the following: Objective #1: Identify cortical and subthalamic biomarkers that can distinguish activity related to physiological motor behaviorfrom that related to pathological symptoms. The goal of objective 1 is to distinguish oscillatory features in population activity based on the temporal, spectral and spatial specificity of their synchronization across the corticosubthalamic axis, e.g. characteristic evolution of beta activity with bradykinesia vs. rhythmic high frequency activity  synchronized during tremor. Features that reflect instantaneous motor behavior and parkinsonian symptom  severity will be characterized through spectral decomposition mapped to 3D reconstructions of recording locations.  Objective #2: Determi11e tlte optimal computational approaclt fol' real-time ,letection and prediction of physiological andpatliophysiological behaviors.  The goal of objective 2 is to use results from the first objective to build a computational framework for deep learning of physiological and pathophysiological states from cortical time-series data based on  hierarchical recurrent artificial neural networks.

"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles.

"Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots PROJECT SUMMARY This application will result in a technological platform that re-empowers persons with severe paralysis, by allowing them to independently control a wide spectrum of robotic actions. Severe paralysis is devastating, and chronic—and reliance on caregivers is persistent. Assistive machines such as wheelchairs and robotic arms offer a groundbreaking path to independence: where control over their environment and interactions is returned to the person.  However, to operate complex machines like robotic arms and hands typically poses a difﬁcult learning challenge and requires complex control signals—and the commercial control interfaces accessible to persons with severe paralysis (e.g. sip-and-puff, switch-based head arrays) are not adequate. As a result, assistive robotic arms remain largely inaccessible to those with severe paralysis—arguably the population who would beneﬁt from them most.  The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. Control interfaces that generate a unique map from a user's body motions to control signals for a machine offer a customized interaction, however these interfaces have only been used to issue low-dimensional (2-D) control signals whereas more complex machines require higher-dimensional (e.g. 6-D) signals. We propose an approach that leverages robotics autonomy and machine learning in order to aid the end-user in learning how to issue effective higher-dimensional control signals through body motions. Speciﬁcally, initially the human issues a lower- dimensional control signal and robotics autonomy is used to bridge the gap by taking over whatever is not covered by the human's control signal. Help from the robotics autonomy is then progressively scaled back, automatically, to cover fewer and fewer control dimensions as the user becomes more skilled.  The ﬁrst piece to our approach deals with how to extract control signals from the human, using the body-machine interface. The development and optimization of decoding procedures for controlling a robotic arm using residual body motions will be addressed under Speciﬁc Aim 1. The second piece to our approach deals with how to interpret control signals from a human within a paradigm that shares control between the human and robotics autonomy. To identify which shared-control formulations most effectively utilize the human's control signals will be the topic of Speciﬁc Aim 2. The ﬁnal piece to our approach deals with how to adapt the shared-control paradigm so that more control is transferred to the human over time. This adaptation is necessary for the human's learning process, since the goal in the end is for the human to be able to fully control the robotic arm him/herself, and will be assessed under Speciﬁc Aim 3.  At the completion of this project, tetraplegic end-users will be able to operate a robotic arm using their residual body motions, through an interface that both promotes the use of residual body motions (and thus also recovery of motor skill) and adapts with the human as their abilities change over time. By leveraging adaptive robotics autonomy, our application moreover provides a safe mechanism to facilitate learning how to operate the robotic platform. Frequently the more severe a person's motor impairment, the less able they are to operate the very assistive machines, like powered wheelchairs and robotic arms, which might enhance their quality of life. The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means, through non-invasive technologies, to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. We propose and study an approach that leverages robot machine learning and autonomy in order to facilitate human motor learning of how to operate a robotic arm using a customized interface, in order to make powered assisted manipulation more accessible to people with severe paralysis. 1",Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots,9448794,R01EB024058,"['3-Dimensional', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Residual state', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shoulder', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injured survivor', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'body-machine interface', 'brain machine interface', 'empowerment', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'n-dimensional', 'novel strategies', 'physical conditioning', 'psychologic', 'robot control', 'sensor', 'two-dimensional']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2018,331851,0.012822221782936832
"Seizure Prediction in a Rodent Model of Focal Epilepsy Project Summary/Abstract: Epilepsy is a debilitating neurological disease affecting 50 million people worldwide. While current management of epilepsy depends on continuous medication or invasive surgery, a deeper understanding of circuit-level pathology and an ability to predict seizures reliably will yield more focused therapeutic approaches. We will induce spontaneous unilateral focal seizures in rats by focal injection of kainic acid into the hippocampus. We will continuously record intracranial EEG, LFP, and video data from these rats for a period of 120 days. Relevant features will then be computed, including signal correlations, coherence, energy, entropies, and phase synchronization, as well as features detected by a sparse autoencoder. We will build train predictive classifiers using the first 90 days of data input to the following algorithms: (1) linear regression, (2) random forest, (3) support vector machines, and (4) neural networks. Performance will be assessed by ROC computed for the last 30 days of data. Next, we will apply single pulse electrical stimuli periodically to a new cohort of continuously monitored rats with unilateral hippocampal focal epilepsy. We will analyze the responses to this single pulse electrical stimulus on intracranial EEG and depth electrodes to determine whether seizures can be interrupted, predicted, then preempted by stimulus. Machine learning approaches coupled with active electrical stimulation will render algorithms that identify changes in the electrographic response to stimulus, which predict subsequent seizures with high sensitivity and specificity. We will leverage the fine spatiotemporal resolution offered by optogenetic techniques to study the nature of seizure initiation at the circuit level in a closed-loop system. We will probe the hippocampal circuit considered a generator in focal epilepsy: pyramidal neurons expressing CamK2a. To target each of these elements, we will induce expression of a halorhodopsin driven by the CamK2a promoter via a lentivirus delivered stereotactically to the hippocampal CA3. We will then stimulate the halorhodopsin with 589 nm light pulses, delivered during pre-ictal activity identified by the predictive algorithms and stimulus response. This closed-loop system will be uniquely informative by altering brain states preemptively rather than during the actual seizure as done in previous studies. Our study will ultimately offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying seizure initiation, and may help improve diagnostics and therapeutic approaches for patients suffering from focal epilepsy. Project Narrative: In a rat model of epilepsy, we will study the patterns of brain electrical activity in response to electrical stimulus, and how those patterns change in distinct brain states including: seizure, immediately before seizure, and between seizures. We will use statistical and computational approaches to predict seizures, and subsequently preempt the predicted seizures using stimulus that targets the seizure-generating circuit in the brain.

"Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is our ability to perform complex, yet previously un-practiced tasks successfully on the first attempt. We refer to this ability as `ad hoc self-programming': `ad hoc' because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; `self-programming' because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. This type of learning differs importantly from trial-and-error learning, in which responses are sculpted incrementally, based on feedback from previous attempts. In comparison to trial-and-error learning, much less is known about ad hoc self- programmed learning, but it clearly represents a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The overall goal of our research proposal is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.  There have been significant barriers to the study of this topic. Among them are the difficulty of studying these processes in animals who require training (which by definition precludes single-trial self- programming), and the lack of access to opportunities with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to study neuronal processes in humans.  The proposed research seeks to address this gap. We leverage critical advances in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and computational modelling, including: 1) availability of a large-scale recording platform enabling simultaneous recordings of 100+ neurons from the cortical surface; 2) opportunities to record from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in human subjects engaged in a custom-designed behavioral task; 3) developments borrowed from the artificial intelligence community to create advanced neural network models of complex cognitive processes.  By applying these innovative methodologies, we focus on addressing our overall goal with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we determine what information about the structure of a novel, complex, instructed task is represented in human dlPFC neuronal activity. We also determine how and when this information is encoded, in terms of spiking activity, oscillatory activity, or coherence between the two. In Aim 2, we determine the relationship between these neuronal representations and behavior. We investigate how the robustness and timing of the emergence of required neural representations relates to response accuracy and reaction time. In Aim 3, we develop a computational model of ad hoc self-programmed learning. To do so, we borrow from recent insights in the AI world regarding prefrontal network structure, and also apply our developing understanding of neural representations from the previous Aims.  We expect that this innovative approach will revolutionize our understanding of this amazing capacity for immediate, configurable learning that characterizes our everyday lives. In doing so, we will develop new strategies to study mechanisms of rapid, flexible cognitive control in general. A better understanding of human cognitive control and its nuanced capacities will naturally translate into an appreciation of deficiencies in these processes, and how they manifest in the form of neuropsychiatric disorders. This appreciation can then lead to the development of rational, targeted therapies. Project Narrative In our everyday lives, we frequently encounter situations that we have never previously faced, but to which we must respond appropriately on the first attempt. The human brain's remarkable ability to rapidly reconfigure its cognitive circuitry to match new task demands and thereby enable such behavior is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The proposed studies leverage exciting new developments in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and artificial intelligence to understand the neuronal circuitry underlying this amazing capacity.","Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex",9628299,U01NS108923,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amaze', 'Animals', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2018,120000,-0.050958436114345335
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9455790,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,377627,0.011827553957879506
"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program will establish new framework for understanding the cognitive neuroscience architecture of scene perception, with the aim of unraveling how the human brain analyzes the geometry and functionality of visual environment in order to guide our actions and navigation in the world.",Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene,9461541,R01EY026042,"['4 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Floor', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visuospatial', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'vector']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,218064,0.005615480834963632
"Neurophysiologically-informed Design of Flexible, 2-learner Brain-Machine Interfaces for Robust and Skillful Performance PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to elucidate the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing. The outcome of the proposed work has the potential to guide the development of the next generation of neurophysiologically-informed, cortically-controlled neuroprosthetic systems for patients with neurological disorders. State-of-the-art brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage machine learning to rapidly calibrate to the neural activity of individuals, but performance also benefits from subjects learning to reliably produce desired neural activity patterns. The basic science and engineering principles of designing such a “2-learner BMI” in which the brain and machine synergistically learn are not well understood. Hence, this proposal aims to investigate how the brain learns when the machine undergoes different degrees of learning, how different degrees of brain learning affect long-term BMI performance, robustness, and generalization, and how these principles can guide the design of a 2-learner BMI system which facilitates brain learning. The proposal is structured in three aims: 1) To study the impact of decoder adaptation on the development of neural encoding models underlying neuroprosthetic skill; 2) To Study how decoder adaptation and resultant neural encoding model influences BMI performance with perturbations (robustness) and BMI performance on unpracticed tasks (generalization); and 3) Design and validation of the next-generation Flexible 2-Learner Decoder architecture. The analyses and experiments proposed in these aims will leverage the fundamental knowledge gained about how the brain learns and acquires neuroprosthetic skills into the neurophysiologically-informed design of robust and high-performance closed-loop motor neuroprosthetics that generalize to new tasks.

"Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Selective attention is an essential cognitive ability that permits us to effectively process and act upon relevant information while ignoring distracting events. A network involving frontal and parietal cortex for top-down attentional control, referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), is active during both spatial and non- spatial (feature-based) attention. However, we know very little about the fine structure of attentional control activity in the DAN, how this structure changes to represent different to-be-attended stimulus features, how the connectivity within the DAN, and between the DAN and sensory cortex shifts when attending different features, or how these top-down processes and their influence in sensory cortex unfold over time. This gap in our knowledge is a critical problem for our models and theories of attention, and because attentional deficits are involved in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia. The working model guiding this research is that top-down attentional control, based on different to-be-attended stimulus attributes, is guided by a smaller-scale neural fine structure within the DAN and prefrontal cortex that makes specific connections with specialized areas of visual cortex coding the attended attributes. Moreover, the time course of activity within the DAN in relation to that in sensory cortex follows a top-down cascading model, being earliest in frontal, then parietal cortex, and finally sensory cortex for preparatory, voluntary, attentional control. To identify the functional networks for attentional control for different forms of attention, and to define their time courses, this project uses innovative simultaneous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Advanced signal processing and modeling, including multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), graph theoretic connectivity analysis, and Granger causality analysis will be used to reveal the fine functional anatomy and time course of attentional control and selection. The project includes three experiments that vary the to-be-attended stimulus attributes from spatial location to stimulus features (color and motion), and pursues three aims. Aim 1 is to reveal the fine structure of top-down preparatory attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus features. Aim 2 is to elucidate the specific connectivity between fine structures for preparatory attentional control in the DAN and their target sensory structures in sensory cortex. Aim 3 is to reveal the time course of top-down attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus attributes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The capacity to focus attention is at the core of human mental functioning, and therefore, elucidating the neural bases of attention remains a central challenge for neuroscience, representing an essential aim in translational efforts to ameliorate attentional deficits in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia.",Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning,9616747,R01MH117991,"['Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Color', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Discrimination', 'Dorsal', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'data integration', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mental function', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective attention', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2018,567754,-0.005552754111156748
"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function.

"CRCNS: Neural Basis of Planning Humans and other animals can choose their actions using multiple learning algorithms and decision­ making strategies. For example, habitual behaviors adapted to a stable environment can be selected using so-called model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, in which the value of each action is incrementally updated according to the amount of unexpected reward. The underlying neural mechanisms for this type of reinforcement learning have been intensively studied. By contrast, how the brain utilizes the animal's knowledge of its environment to plan sequential actions using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm remains unexplored. In this application, PIs with complementary expertise will investigate how different subdivisions of the primate prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and arbitration of different learning algorithms during strategic planning in primates, using a sequential game referred to as ""4-in-a­ row"". Previous studies have revealed that with training, humans improve their competence in this game by gradually switching away from a model-free reinforcement learning towards a model-based reinforcement learning in the form of a tree search. In the first set of experiments, we will train non-human primates to play the 4-in-a-row game against a computer opponent. We predict that the complexity of the strategic planning and the opponent's move violating the animal's expectation will be reflected in the speed of animal's action and pupil diameters. Next, we will test how the medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and selection of different learning algorithms during strategic interaction between the animal and computer opponent. We hypothesize that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in computing the integrated values of alternative actions originating from multiple sources and guiding the animal's choice, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex might be more involved in monitoring and resolving the discrepancies of actions favored by different learning algorithms. The results from these experiments will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms for complex strategic planning and unify various approaches to study naturalistic behaviors. By taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning and decision neuroscience, proposed studies will elucidate how multiple learning algorithms are simultaneously implemented and coordinated via specific patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex. The results from these studies will transform the behavioral and analytical paradigms used to study high-order planning and their neural underpinnings in humans and animals. Strategic planning is commonly impaired in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and depression, but their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. The proposed studies will elucidate the role of prefrontal cortex in implementing and arbitrating between multiple learning algorithms used for strategic planning.",CRCNS: Neural Basis of Planning,9692133,R01MH118925,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Update', 'base', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fictional works', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'source guides']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,429555,-0.013981427806465921
"Toward Automated Spike Sorting via Ground Truth Neural Recordings PROJECT​ ​SUMMARY Scaling extracellular electrophysiology to higher channel counts is hindered by the burden of data handling,storage, and especially preprocessing, e.g. spike sorting ​[1]​. The burden of spike sorting can in principle be reduced through a combination of high-density multielectrode array (probe) technology and algorithm optimization to yield a spike sorting method that is both highly accurate and fully automated [2–4]​. With a known-good spike sorting method in hand, the algorithm can be baked into the data stream as early as possible to allow for automatic data sorting and a massive reduction in data rate to downstream storage and processing. However, it takes an investment of considerable resources to implement this sort of large-scale real-time processing, and great confidence to throw away raw data and keep​ ​only​ ​processed​ ​data. Accuracy and automation of spike sorting increases with the spatial density of recording sites ​[5–7]​. Neural activity recorded from high-density probes can serve as a data corpus for testing the accuracy of spike sorting algorithms. However, to quantify spike sorting performance for comparison between algorithms, the ground truth spiking activity of neurons captured in the data corpus must be measured, such as by simultaneously recording via patch-clamp pipette or some other recording modality ​[8–10]​. Unfortunately, because ground truth recordings are so challenging to perform, they remain too rare to allow for this sort of analysis in a large-scale, meaningful way ​[11]​.

"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy in a double-blinded study of 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Additional aims are to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment and identify the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of using modern neuroimaging techniques.",Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis,9596726,R01DC016800,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Randomized', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavioral neurology', 'clinical investigation', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'predicting response', 'primary outcome', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,609151,-0.02385756391876313
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9442865,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'source localization', 'surgery outcome']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2018,531286,-0.002722081473028863
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning. Deep understanding of sensory-motor systems will aid in development of new treatment modalities for diseases that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. n/a","CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling",9524750,R01NS100049,"['Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Huntington Disease', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'control theory', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional plasticity', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mathematical analysis', 'medical schools', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'sensorimotor system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,205290,-0.007946905187600682
"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,9572928,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Contusions', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Volition', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'somatosensory', 'treadmill', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2018,1060180,0.03531586663730409
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9468973,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2018,34421,0.0018795949009934832
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9526901,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Internships', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'data warehouse', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2018,281216,-0.001964529066902724
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data.

"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD,9569720,R01NS100849,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction Time', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2018,77376,-0.024445663694040422
"Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant processing of social and affective information is a severe and disabling symptom across many neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent reports demonstrate that direct electrical brain stimulation (EBS) can alter perception, such as changing the identity of a person being viewed or causing memory-related hallucinations. If EBS can distort normal perception, then EBS using different parameters may be able to normalize SAP, for example by modulating affective salience to visual stimuli in PTSD. One key impediment towards developing EBS as a therapy for SAP pathology is that we lack an understanding of how electrical stimulation modulates neurodynamics and cognition. A critical step towards designing rational EBS-based stimulation parameters for SAP pathology is building a causal model of the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics, interregional interactions, and EBS modulation of these dynamics and interactions during SAP. Visual SAP relies on a neural circuit in the temporal lobe that includes the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Non-invasive brain imaging techniques either lack the temporal resolution to examine millisecond dynamics (fMRI/PET), or are relatively insensitive to activity in deep brain structures such as the amygdala (MEG/EEG/TMS). Direct neural recordings using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy will allow us to overcome these barriers to study the dynamics and interactions in the SAP circuit. Furthermore, delivery of EBS via these implanted electrodes will allow us to examine how electrical modulation of this circuit alters SAP. Using iEEG and advanced analysis methods from machine learning, we recently delineated the set of information processing stages that FG goes through for face perception. In this project, we will test a three- stage dynamic model of the sequence of events and interregional interactions that enable SAP based on these previous results, the work of others, and our preliminary data. We will record iEEG in our regions of interest to test neural dynamics during three critical aspects of social affective processing: perception of facial expression (Aim 1), the inference of actions from motion (Aim 2), and guiding conscious perception to affectively and socially salient stimuli (Aim 3). Then we will employ EBS to modulate perception during these processes. In addition, we will supplement iEEG with magnetoencephalography (MEG), which, while less sensitive to amygdala activity, provides whole-brain cortical coverage and facilitates the comparison of iEEG results to a normative population. The outcome of the proposed research will be a spatially and temporally specific model of the causal dynamics and interactions during SAP. This model will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted EBS therapies that may normalize pathological SAP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Abnormalities in social affective perception are a critical part of the etiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The proposed research will map the detailed neurodynamics of critical aspects of social affective perception and examine how these neurodynamics, and the associated cognitions, can be modulated by brain stimulation. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of social affective perception, a circuit relevant to a number of mental disorders, and take a critical step towards determining how brain stimulation may be used to remediate pathological social affective perception.","Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation",9488537,R01MH107797,"['Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anger', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Body Image', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Perception', 'Feedback', 'Form Perception', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'encephalography', 'evidence base', 'face perception', 'healthy volunteer', 'information processing', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,446302,-0.022470223970589134
"Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroscience is producing increasingly complex data sets, including measures and manipulations of sub- cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular mechanisms operating over multiple timescales and in the context of different behaviors and task conditions. These data sets pose several fundamental challenges. First, for a given data set, what are the relevant spatial, temporal, and computational scales in which the underlying information-processing dynamics are best understood? Second, what are the best ways to design and select models to account for these dynamics, given the inevitably limited, noisy, and uneven spatial and temporal sampling used to collect the data? Third, what can increasingly complex data sets, collected under increasingly complex conditions, tells us about how the brain itself processes complex information? The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate new, theoretically grounded methods to help researchers to overcome these challenges. Our primary hypothesis is that resolving, modeling, and interpreting relevant information- processing dynamics from complex data sets depends critically on approaches that are built upon understanding the notion of complexity itself. A key insight driving this proposal is that definitions of complexity that come from different fields, and often with different interpretations, in fact have a common mathematical foundation. This common foundation implies that different approaches, from direct analyses of empirical data to model fitting, can extract statistical features related to computational complexity that can be compared directly to each other and interpreted in the context of ideal-observer benchmarks. Starting with this idea, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish a common theoretical foundation for analyzing both data and model complexity; 2) develop practical, complexity-based tools for data analysis and model selection; and 3) establish the usefulness of complexity-based metrics for understanding how the brain processes complex information. Together, these Aims provide new theoretical and practical tools for understanding how the brain integrates information across large temporal and spatial scales, using formal, universal definitions of complexity to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of complex neural and behavioral data sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will establish new, theoretically grounded computational tools to help neuroscience researchers design and analyze studies of brain function. These tools, which will be made widely available to the neuroscience research community, will help support a broad range of studies of the brain, enhance scientific discovery, and promote rigor and reproducibility.","Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience",9615324,R01EB026945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'design', 'information processing', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,21379,0.004498589429478833
"Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging Project Summary. Neuroimaging is poised to take a substantial leap forward in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of human behavior, due to a combination of improved analytic techniques and the quality of imaging data. These advances are allowing researchers to develop population-level multivariate models of the functional brain representations underlying behavior, performance, clinical status and prognosis, and other outcomes. Population-based models can identify patterns of brain activity, or `signatures', that can predict behavior and decode mental states in new individuals, producing generalizable knowledge and highly reproducible maps. These signatures can capture behavior with large effect sizes, and can be used and tested across research groups. However, the potential of such signatures is limited by neuroanatomical constraints, in particular individual variation in functional brain anatomy. To circumvent this problem, current models are either applied only to individual participants, severely limiting generalizability, or force participants' data into anatomical reference spaces (atlases) that do not respect individual functional topology and boundaries. Here we seek to overcome this shortcoming by developing new topological models for inter-subject alignment, which register participants' functional brain maps to one another. This will increase effective spatial resolution, and more importantly allow us to explicitly analyze the spatial topology of functional maps make inferences on differences in activation location and shape across persons and psychological states. We will test and validate the methods using a purpose-designed experiment (n = 120) that includes two types of naturalistic narrative experiences (movies and audio stories) and tasks from three functional domains (pain, emotion, and cognition). The tasks are designed with several constraints in mind, including: (1) systematic coverage of cognitive, emotional, and sensory tasks matched in stimulus properties (e.g., stimulus duration); and (2) multiple levels of task demand within each task, to permit parametric modeling and prediction of demand levels. We will compare our new methods to existing methods based on out-of-sample effect sizes in predicting behavior and test-retest reliability. We will make the analytic methods, software, and dataset available to other researchers, along with a library of functional reference spaces for multiple psychological states. Project Narrative. We develop new methods for enhancing the development of models that can predict behavior, clinical status, and other outcomes using neuroimaging data. Successful development will help improve the translational impact of neuroimaging. It will also contribute to developing multidisciplinary neuroscience, by promoting the development of neural signatures for specific mental processes in humans with increased precision and specificity.",Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging,9577381,R01EB026549,"['Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Charon', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gaussian model', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Processes', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Wages', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'mental state', 'model development', 'movie', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'statistics', 'translational impact']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,710896,-0.007962479405987077
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled.

"A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis Project Summary  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a robust hybrid neural-machine interface (NMI), combining brain and muscle signals, to improve overall control of a lower limb prosthetic device during activities of daily living. Limb amputation affects over 600,000 individuals annually in the US, and is a major cause of physical disability that causes activities of daily living to become difficult or impossible for the amputee. The limitations of current lower-limb prostheses are associated with limited volitional control, reduced mobility, and chronic gait abnormalities, which have been linked to exhaustion from increased energy expenditure, increased risk of falling, and degenerative bone and joint disorders in both the intact and amputated limb. In this study, EMG signals from both residual and intact lower limbs and EEG signals from the cortex are leveraged to decode transitions to and from various modes of locomotion modes in able-bodied individuals and transfemoral amputees, and to provide a global understanding of movement at the cortical, muscular, and kinematic level in amputees. Specifically, time and frequency domain features are leveraged to create a prediction algorithm capable of identifying upcoming terrain transitions in advance. In lower limb amputees, this hybrid NMI paradigm translates to volitional control of a powered lower-limb prosthesis, which allows for seamless transitions between various movement conditions. The high-level of control is expected to result in significant increases in level of activity and overall improvements in gait. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of EEG or EMG based NMIs for orthotic and prosthetic devices; however, no study to date has integrated EEG and EMG in a NMI for powered lower limb prostheses. This study is motivated by the need to explore advanced neural control sources for intuitive control of artificial limbs.  This project aligns directly with the Mission & Goals of the NIH, the Brain Initiative, and NIH’s Blueprint Program by expanding fundamental knowledge of neuroscience, human, health and wellness; by utilizing an innovative research strategy; and ultimately returning the knowledge to the public through the development of a highly advanced medical technology. Furthermore, the technology developed through this work has implications beyond the amputee population in the treatment of many neurological conditions and injuries, such as in neurorehabilitation after stroke. The innovation of this project lies in the novel approach of using multimodal neural signals and movement synergies as a framework for interpreting movement of the lower limb. The scientific impact is realized by a greater understanding of the neural correlates of movement after lower-limb amputation. The direct clinical significance for the patient can be measured directly through improved gait performance and walking confidence, leading to increased mobility and a reduced risk of falling, exhaustion, and bone and joint disorders. Project Narrative  The development of a hybrid neural-machine interface that incorporates muscle and brain signaling for communication with robotic systems is important to public health because it allows for robust volitional control of powered prostheses and exoskeletons during activities of daily living. This will directly benefit the amputee population by allowing better control of their prosthesis during locomotion, especially when navigating complex terrains, such as stairs and inclines. The implications of this technology can be used beyond the amputee population to further understand the effect of neurological injuries on the brain, and for improving rehabilitation paradigms associated with their treatment.",A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis,9604145,F99NS105210,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Body Image', 'Bone Diseases', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Electronic Mail', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Agency', 'Future Teacher', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences', 'Oral', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Ramp', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Robotics', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'exhaustion', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'posters', 'powered prosthesis', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rehabilitation paradigm', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot control', 'robot exoskeleton', 'robot rehabilitation', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'undergraduate student', 'visual motor']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,F99,2018,36509,0.0064080586900514035
"Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans ABSTRACT In the course of a day we naturally make multiple shifts in our overall cognitive state and in our aims and intents. We go from sleep to awake, from internal dialogue to external communication, from relative immobility to planned complex movements. The neural activity which distinguishes these different high-level states is unknown and yet is a fundamental aspect to understanding overall cognitive processes. It is also a baseline substrate that is adversely impacted by a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases. Our understanding of human cortical neurophysiology is almost entirely based on cognitive processes examined within the constraints of experimentally controlled tasks with time-locked, stimulus-driven behaviors. However, brain activity is fluid and continuous; much of our essential cognitive activity is not externally triggered but internally generated. The overarching goal of this research is to create platforms which allow for continuous acquisition of high-fidelity neural ensemble activity synchronized with behavioral data and contextual information to allow investigations into volitional changes in focus and intent. Data will be acquired from two groups of patients: those undergoing intracranial exploration for treatment of their epilepsy and patients implanted with multi- electrode arrays as part of the BrainGate clinical trial to restore communication and mobility to people with paralysis. Using this novel paradigm for investigation, we will explore the neural basis for changes in state which are dominated by receptive activities, internal thought and external interaction. We initially focus on motor behavior with a traditional task construction constraining the participant to watch, imagine and then attempt or actually move. We expand this to spontaneous activity in Aim 2. Finally, we move toward more general and abstracted investigations of volitional state by looking at an analogous task and spontaneous behavior with respect to language and communication (Aim 3). At each stage we will employ spectral, functional connectivity and data mining techniques to understand the neural underpinnings of these different states as well as the temporal dynamics that portend changes in state. Supporting all of these aims will be improvements and expansions in state-of-the-art human micro- and mesoscale neural recording environments to enable the study of continuous, real-time neural activity underlying state changes. Across aims we will explore the extent to which motor cortex alone contains the information which may be present in more widespread and higher order cortical regions. Our hypothesis is that motor cortex, does in fact, encode significant information about state in ways which encapsulate or summarize the information available in more wide spread regions. Most importantly, the questions inherent in this research are key to understanding human thought patterns at a fundamental level. This understanding has important implications not just for basic cognitive neuroscience but for our understanding of the processes which are altered in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, the dementias, depression, and psychosis. The results of these studies are also essential for the practical instantiation of effective brain-machine interfaces which would allow patients to act autonomously. Narrative: From simple decisions to more significant and complex thoughts, we constantly shift our aims and intentions and the degree to which we are interacting externally or internally. Understanding these shifts is key to the development of truly autonomous brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics as well as to understanding how these kinds of alterations can be compromised in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. In this project we go beyond routine cognitive studies based on constrained stimulus response designs and instead utilize continuous recordings of neural activity during spontaneous behavior to decode changes in volitional state during motor activity and communication.",Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans,9551101,U01NS098968,"['Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Microelectrodes', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Volition', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'data mining', 'design', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroprosthesis', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2018,1528951,0.01114228885501855
"RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data Project Summary/Abstract  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allows the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded. We use the term ECOG to refer to the entire range of invasive recording techniques (from subdural strips and grids to penetrating electrodes) that share the common attribute of recording neural activity from the human brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. While this ability has resulted in many high-impact advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain function in health and disease, it generates staggering amounts of data as a single patient can be implanted with hundreds of electrodes, each sampled thousands of times a second for hours or even days. The difficulty of exploring these vast datasets is the rate-limiting step in using them to improve human health. We propose to overcome this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the unique properties of ECOG. We dub this software tool RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).  The first goal of Aim 1 is to release RAVE 1.0 to the entire ECOG community by month 6 of the first funding period. This will maximize transformative impact by putting the new tools in the hands of users as quickly as possible, facilitating rapid adoption. The design philosophy of RAVE is driven by three imperatives. The first is to keep users ""close to the data"" so that users may make discoveries about the brain without being misled by artifacts. The second imperative is rigorous statistical methodology. The final imperative is ""play well with others"". As described in Aim 2, our approach will make it easy to seamlessly incorporate new and existing analysis tools written in Matlab, C++, Python or R into RAVE, giving users the best of both worlds: advanced but easy-to-use visualization of results from ECOG experiments, whether they are analyzed with the off-the- shelf tools routines provided with RAVE or novel tools developed by others. Project Narrative  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allow the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded with high spatial and temporal resolution. ECOG generates staggering amounts of data, and the rate-limiting step in generating new insights about the human brain is the difficulty in exploring this vast quantity of data. We propose to remove this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the analysis and visualization of ECOG data, known as RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).",RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data,9592408,R24MH117529,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Amalgam', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Imagery', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nightmare', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Philosophy', 'Play', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Software Tools', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'college', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'wiki']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R24,2018,244545,-0.008687074706564171
"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA,9449472,R01MH064537,"['Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gaussian model', 'Grant', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'parallel processing', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'source localization', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'trend']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,378758,0.009592300535684021
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9408628,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Auricular prosthesis', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ferrets', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,327250,-0.0008197045907918115
"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks. Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy, which affects nearly 4% of the population over their lifetime, roughly one third of afflicted patients are incompletely responsive to anticonvulsant drugs, requiring in severe cases neurosurgical resections or novel approaches such as deep-brain stimulation (DBS). Recently, I helped develop an electrophysiology-based online DBS protocol for seizure detection and interruption in rodent models of absence epilepsy, a form of epilepsy involving aberrant thalamocortical activity. However, like other online DBS procedures which detect seizures as they occur, there was little ability to predict incipient seizures due in large part to limited spatiotemporal resolution of the signal we used, the electrocorticogram (ECoG). ECoG and related electroencephalogram (EEG), being large scale local field potential approaches, do not provide single-cell resolution of neural dynamics that are likely required to obtain predictive information. Over the last decade, the field of brain-machine interface (BMI) has made breakthroughs in neuroscience and engineering by developing methods for multi-electrode array recording of large scale neural spiking activity and efficient reduction of the resultant high-dimensional neural activity to a smaller number of dimensions to effectively control neural prostheses. We predict that this approach will be invaluable for understanding neural dynamics during seizures and stimulation, and for developing predictive algorithms and adaptive DBS protocols.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to precisely characterize thalamocortical neural activity during spontaneous absence seizures and following thalamic stimulation by combining large-scale thalamic and cortical neural recordings, optogenetics, and BMI mathematical techniques. Additionally, the experiments presented in this proposal will use the recorded neural activity to develop adaptive algorithms that both predict oncoming seizure activity and modify stimulation parameters based on the neural state and response to stimulation in real-time. This proposal is aimed towards increasing our understanding of the neural dynamics of epileptic networks and improving the efficacy and safety of online DBS. Roughly one third of epileptic patients are resistant to pharmacological treatment, which has promoted the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a means to detect and prevent seizures. However, the neural activity underlying epileptic discharges and the effects of DBS on this activity are poorly understood, partially due to the limited information carried by the EEG signals used for monitoring seizures. A more precise characterization of epileptic neural circuits is crucial to improve current DBS design and enhance the sensitivity and efficacy of seizure detection and disruption, which demands the tools and resources of basic research.",Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks.,9408441,F31NS100265,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Generalized seizures', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'markov model', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,38516,0.01970950349744672
"Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control Project Summary/Abstract  Millions of people suffer from some form of paralysis. In most of these cases the connection between the brain and the spinal cord is damaged, however, the motor cortex is healthy and intact. Thus, for these individuals, brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) hold significant promise for improving quality of life. BMIs decode an individual's intention to move by utilizing statistical models of neural activity patterns recorded from the motor cortex using implanted electrode arrays. While these methods have been encouraging in preclinical experiments and clinical trials for controlling thought-driven 2D computer cursors, they suffer from poor performance when applied to higher degrees-of-freedom (e.g., robotic limbs), and are not robust to the inevitable degradation of the electrode array. In order to address these clinical needs, this project starts from the recent observation that just as some behaviors are easier to learn, some patterns of neural activity, termed neural states, are also easier to generate. The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate if these “easy to generate” neural states can be used to robustly control a prosthetic arm. This is a significant departure from current decoding methods, which incorporate little to no information about the motor system, especially its ability to learn and adapt. The first major aim of this work is to develop experiments and analysis methods in order to find these “easy to generate” neural states in the non- human primate (i.e., rhesus monkey) motor system. Here “easy to generate” can be understood as the monkey's ability to volitionally generate that particular neural state. The second major aim of this work is to characterize the properties of the motor system that enable some states to be more easily generated than others. Prior work in our lab has shown that motor cortical population activity has well-defined structure, as predicted by dynamical system theory. These dynamics cause neural states to evolve in lawful ways through time. The work here will extend these findings by characterizing the dynamics associated with a monkey learning to generate a neural state. Finally, the third major aim of this work is to determine if neural states that monkeys can volitionally generate can be utilized for robust control of a prosthetic arm. The central hypothesis of this work is that building a model that only utilizes firing patterns that can be easily generated (as determined experimentally) will enable robust and high-performance control of a prosthetic arm. If successful, this study could have significant clinical impact by presenting a new paradigm to enable robust control of a prosthesis. Project Narrative  Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injuries or neurodegenerative diseases that result in considerable movement impairment. Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) hold considerable promise in drastically improving the quality of life for these individuals, who otherwise have very limited treatment options. This work will investigate the motor system's ability to learn and adapt, and directly use these insights to build robust high degree-of-freedom BMIs for clinical applications.",Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control,9573606,F31NS103409,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Arm', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Robotics', 'Spinal Cord', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Volition', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'brain machine interface', 'clinical application', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'motor impairment', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'pre-clinical', 'prosthesis control', 'rehearsal', 'relating to nervous system']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,34064,-0.000735073000374432
"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,9615336,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2018,21194,-0.004651992469144229
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9504668,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,727051,0.020963974872952734
"Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understanding how stored memories change as a function of experience. The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weaker—it can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia. In all of these conditions, cogni- tive deficits can arise from insufficient separation of representations. This research may lead to better ways of re-differentiating these representations and—through this—ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits. NARRATIVE This work has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of when learning decreases overlap between memories in the brain (differentiation) or increases overlap (integration). Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dementia, and dyslexia: In all of these conditions, cognitive deficits can arise when there is insufficient neural separation of memories or concepts (e.g., temporal lobe stroke can “collapse” stored visual knowledge, preventing retrieval of names of common objects). The learning models and interventions developed here may eventually lead to new and better ways of re-differentiating these collapsed representa- tions and ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits.","Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning",9506818,R01MH069456,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Running', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'behavioral study', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'memory retrieval', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'phonology', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,455418,-0.006850385124449913
"Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation ABSTRACT Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and more than 5 million people worldwide. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an effective treatment for the motor signs of PD. However, DBS is often limited by partial efficacy, side effects, and long and difficult clinical visits to identify and program therapeutic stimulation settings. Additionally, PD symptoms fluctuate from moment-to-moment depending on a multitude of factors, and therefore the demand for stimulation (or medication) changes throughout the day. There is a clear need for automated, individualized DBS programming strategies that can both reduce programming time and adapt to deliver optimal stimuli as each patient's symptoms fluctuate. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the quality of life for PD patients by providing them with an intelligent, adaptive, closed-loop DBS algorithm. In Aim 1, we propose to create a closed-loop DBS algorithm in silico that can learn from and adapt to electro-physiological signatures of parkinsonian states in order to deliver optimal, patient- specific stimulation. The algorithm will be built upon the framework of reinforcement learning, which has several desirable properties that make it ideally suited for use in a closed-loop DBS algorithm. Given a biomarker for parkinsonian severity and a set of possible actions, the algorithm will autonomously learn how to deliver stimulus to reduce the biomarker and therefore PD symptoms. Preliminary results shown in this proposal suggest that the algorithm is able to learn complex actions without a priori knowledge, and can help to control a selected biomarker. In Aim 2, we propose to test out the algorithm in a large animal model of PD with high-density DBS arrays that have been shown to enable more advanced current steering and higher resolution local field potential recordings. We will then apply the algorithm and compare its performance to continuous DBS in terms of effects on individual parkinsonian motor signs as well as the electrophysiological signal targeted by the algorithm. This project will not only provide a means to critically evaluate putative biomarkers of DBS therapy for alleviating parkinsonian motor signs, but also provide a much more versatile and powerful closed-loop algorithm for use in titrating DBS therapy for individuals with Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders amenable to deep brain stimulation therapy. As a result of this project, we will create a closed-loop DBS algorithm that can help improve the quality of life for Parkinson's disease patients. NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and while dopamine replacement medication is well established for alleviating many of the motor symptoms of PD, but deep brain stimulation (DBS) is often indicated, in conjunction with medication as the disease progresses. One of the significant challenges with DBS is patient-specific dosimetry of stimulation settings to efficiently achieve a strong and consistent therapeutic effect. This project will develop an innovative reinforcement learning algorithm that autonomously learns which stimulation settings are most effective at reducing parkinsonian motor signs based on closed-loop feedback of oscillatory activity within the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus using high-density electrode arrays.",Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,9638443,F31NS103487,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurotoxins', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'computational network modeling', 'deep brain stimulation array', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'density', 'dosimetry', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'investigator training', 'motor symptom', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2018,30197,0.01648624317142221
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,9483579,R00AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Screening', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R00,2018,249000,-0.003700579319629967
"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis. NARRATIVE  In this project we will develop a filtered point process framework for neural data analysis, with models and algorithms for sparse recovery of spike-trains from time-series data comprising a series of pulsed waveforms. We will use this novel methodology to extract neuronal spike-trains from calcium imaging data of cortical tissue, and to estimate hormone secretion times and amounts from serum hormone levels. We will make our mathematical algorithms for neural data analysis and their software implementation freely and easily available to the neuroscience research community.",Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data,9546689,R01EB022726,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Corticotropin', 'Coupled', 'Cushing Syndrome', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Endocrine system', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Life', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Noise', 'Osteoporosis', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathologic', 'Periodicity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Somatotropin', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'V1 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'area striata', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mathematical algorithm', 'movie', 'neural model', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual cognition', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,332220,-0.003747541881594489
"Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and translation to neuroprosthetics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences.  Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living.  We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern of interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks.  Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 μm diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1).  More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks.  We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks.  The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control.  We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2).  This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom.  We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding.  This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints.  This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For ""Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements:  characterization and translation in neuroprosthetics"" This project will use recordings from the surface of the human brain to study how brain networks control arm and hand movements.

"Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology No abstract available Project Narrative Typical human hearing is remarkably robust to the presence of background noise, but listeners with age- related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments – and often do not benefit from contemporary hearing aids in these conditions. In my doctoral work, using fMRI in humans I showed that real-world background noise engages different mechanisms than the simpler synthetic noise typically employed in previous work. In my postdoctoral work I will be trained in marmoset electrophysiology to zoom in to the level of neural circuits to probe the mechanisms that generate auditory cortex's robustness to background noise.",Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology,9681144,F32DC017628,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Auricular prosthesis', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Callithrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Coffee', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Presbycusis', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rain', 'Research', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'sound', 'temporal measurement']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2018,58282,-0.003785213379327212
"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9563948,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2018,33530,-0.012916035396327767
"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions. The starting point of the project is our earlier discovery that phase structure in oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) of hippocampal areas CA1/CA3 carry location information in exquisite detail (Agarwal et al. 2014). We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations. The computational description level will leverage ideas of vector symbolic architectures, a class of connectionist models originally proposed for describing cognitive reasoning (Plate, 1995; Kanerva, 1996). Models produced by the software tool will concisely encapsulate assumptions about the computation and its implementation of a brain function and produce predictions that can be tested in a next generation of recording experiments. The proposed theory framework will be tested in building models for navigation in hippocampus and for visual processing in areas V1 and V4 in cortex. Project narrative: A key difficulty with inferring brain function from recordings of neural activity in a working brain is that the dynamics of individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Here we address this problem by delivering new tools for decoding and decomposing neural population activity, leveraging the recent discovery by the PI of behavior-specific phase structure of local field potentials. Further, we provide software and a theoretical framework for describing models of brain function on a computational and mechanistic level that can produce testable predictions for a new generation of brain recording experiments.",Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings,9615743,R01EB026955,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Encapsulated', 'Fostering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'area V1', 'area V4', 'base', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'independent component analysis', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'presynaptic', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'visual processing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,21212,-0.02118131522546729
"Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations Project Summary/Abstract The mammalian brain builds and transforms representations of the outside world through the concerted activity of populations of neurons, but the extent to which spike times or spike counts are coordinated within these ensembles beyond pairs is not clear. Models of neural encoding predict variable frequencies of spike pattern occurrence, and models of decoding delineate requirements for spike time precision within the population response. While considerable effort has been made toward the development and refinement of the theoretical basis of such neural coding schemes, and predictions have been tested against single cell and pairwise data, there has been relatively little experimental data beyond pairs able to differentiate between competing hypotheses of population coding. The proposed career development plan aims to marry large-scale electrophysiology in primary visual cortex with analysis of specific predictions derived from computational and theoretical neuroscience work for spike time coordination beyond pairwise interactions. The candidate has a deep background in in vivo experimental techniques and proposes to receive training in the high-dimensional computational techniques and to use experimental data collected to validate specific theoretical predictions. This training will establish the skills necessary for a successful independent research career studying the mechanisms of information representation and transfer in visual cortex, bridging the gap between experimental and computational neuroscience. The candidate will carry out the mentored phase under the guidance of Dr. Clay Reid, a world expert in multiple aspects of mammalian central visual processing including anatomy, physiology, and computation. Additional advising from Dr. Eric Shea- Brown and Dr. Christof Koch will provide guidance in the theoretical and applied mathematical approaches required to implement and assess advanced models of neural encoding and decoding. The training will utilize the strengths of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in collecting large-scale data and the didactic opportunities at the University of Washington. In the independent phase the candidate will use the newly acquired analytical and modeling skills in combination with his previous training in optogenetic techniques to better constrain population measurements.

"2019 Dendrites: Molecules, Structure and Function Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar Project Summary Dendrites play a central role in neuronal computation by integrating thousands of synaptic inputs to generate the output of the neuron in the form of action potentials. Recent advances in molecular, electrophysiological and imaging techniques have led to a rapid enhancement in our understanding of the mechanisms that shape dendritic structure, function and connectivity and the contribution of dendritic computation to behavior. Computational and theoretical approaches have further refined our views of dendrites and their unique role in brain function. Notably, dendrite structure and function may undergo plastic changes that contribute to nervous system development and learning, and dysfunction in these mechanisms can lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. The 2019 Gordon Research Conference and Seminar on Dendrites will bring together researchers whose latest findings help clarify how the properties of dendrites enable them to perform complex computations important for sensory-motor processing and higher cognitive function.The goal of this meeting is to exchange knowledge at the frontiers of dendrite research and strengthen communication among researchers from numerous disciplines who investigate dendrites. Project Narrative Neuronal dendrites receive and integrate inputs from other neurons to regulate the information flow through neural circuits. This Gordon Research Conference and Seminar will convene scientists of all levels and from diverse fields of neuroscience to present and discuss cutting-edge research on dendrite structure and function in health and disease.

"Artificial neural networks for high performance, fully automated particle tracking analysis even at low signal-to-noise regimes Abstract: Particle tracking (PT) is a powerful biophysical tool for elucidating molecular interactions, transport phenomena and rheological properties in complex biological environments. Unfortunately, PT remains a niche tool in life and physical sciences with a limited user base, in large part due to significant time and technical constraints in extracting accurate time-variant positional data from recorded movies. These constraints are exacerbated in experiments with low signal-to-noise ratios or substantial heterogeneity, as frequently encountered with nanoparticles and pathogens in biological fluids. Currently available software that attempts to automate the movie analysis process rely almost exclusively on assigning static image filters based on specific intensity, pixel size and signal-to-noise ratio thresholds. Unfortunately, when applied to actual experimental data with substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity, the current software generally produces substantial numbers of false positives (i.e. tracking artifacts) or false negatives (i.e. missing actual traces), and frequently both. Frequent user intervention is thus required to ensure accurate tracking even when using sophisticated tracking software, markedly reducing experimental throughput and resulting in substantial user- to-user variations in analyzed data. The time required for accurate particle tracking analysis makes PT experiments exceedingly expensive compared to other commonly used experimental techniques in life sciences. These same tracking analysis limitations have effectively precluded investigators from undertaking more sophisticated 3D PT, even though the microscopy capability to obtain such movies is readily available and critical scientific insights can be gained from 3D PT. To circumvent the challenges with currently available particle tracking software, we have developed a new approach for particle identification and tracking, based on machine learning and convolutional neural networks (CNN). CNN is a type of feed-forward artificial neural network designed to process information in a layered network of connections that mimics the organization of real neural networks in the mammalian retina and visual cortex. Unlike most CNN imaging models that are trained to make predictions on static images, we have trained our CNN to input adjacent frames so that each prediction includes information from the past and future, thus effectively performing convolutions in both space and time to infer particle locations. Similar principles of image analysis are now being harnessed by developers of autonomous vehicle technologies to distinguish the motions of different objects on the road. We have applied our CNN tracking algorithm to a wide range of 2D movies capturing dynamic motions of nanoparticles, viruses and highly motile bacteria, achieving at least 30-fold time savings with virtually no need for human intervention while maintaining robust tracking performance (i.e. low false positive and low false negative rates). In this STTR proposal, we seek to focus on further optimization and testing of our neural network tracking platform for 2D PT, including the use of cloud computing (Aim 1), and extending our neural network tracker to enable accurate 3D PT (Aim 2). Our vision is to popularize PT as a research tool among researchers by minimizing the time and labor costs associated with PT analysis. Narrative Particle tracking is a powerful biophysical tool in life and physical sciences, but unfortunately its application has been strongly limited by inefficiencies in accurately extracting particle traces from raw movies. Unlike conventional particle tracking methods, we have combined artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a computational neural network that can recognize objects in much the same way as the human eye, and which consistently provided superior and truly automated tracking performance compared to current alternatives. This STTR will establish the feasibility of using our computational neural network for robust 2D and 3D particle tracking analysis.","Artificial neural networks for high performance, fully automated particle tracking analysis even at low signal-to-noise regimes",9347679,R41GM123897,"['Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radial', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Spottings', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical tools', 'cell motility', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'field study', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'movie', 'nanoparticle', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'physical science', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'submicron', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"AI TRACKING SOLUTIONS, LLC",R41,2017,224997,0.00019737436754554378
"Machine Learning-Based Control of Functional Electrical Stimulation Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of quadriplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles.

"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program will establish new framework for understanding the cognitive neuroscience architecture of scene perception, with the aim of unraveling how the human brain analyzes the geometry and functionality of visual environment in order to guide our actions and navigation in the world.",Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene,9245696,R01EY026042,"['4 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Floor', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visuospatial', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'vector']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,318064,0.005615480834963632
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9244854,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2017,30367,0.011827553957879506
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9240674,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'source localization']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2017,531286,-0.002722081473028863
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces.

"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.  We will reach critical milestones that will provide the basis for a series of clinical trials for furter defining the efficacy of these interventions.",Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI,9358722,U01EB015521,"['Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Bromocriptine', 'Buspirone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'FDA approved', 'Felis catus', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Oral', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'arm', 'arm function', 'design', 'human subject', 'improved', 'injured', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'motor function recovery', 'motor recovery', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'public health relevance', 'response']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2017,865006,0.02474510726158918
"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment.",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,9405277,UH3NS103550,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Resistance', 'Scalp structure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'antidepressant effect', 'base', 'connectome', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'implantation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'patient population', 'response', 'support tools', 'targeted biomarker', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'white matter']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,UH3,2017,5562,0.016006855917989175
"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,9360609,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Contusions', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Volition', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'somatosensory', 'treadmill', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2017,457885,0.03531586663730409
"The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risky behaviors such as smoking, drug and alcohol use, and teenaged sexual intercourse are all heavily influenced by the behaviors of one's peers. While much is known about the neural networks involved in risky decision-making, this research has largely been conducted in the absence of the rich network of social information available when making risky decisions in real-life. Given the large body of evidence suggesting the importance of information about peers' choices when making risky decisions, it is of great public-health relevance to understand how the integration of this information into the risky decision takes place at the neural level, and, particularly, what differences in processing of this information lead some people to be more susceptible to peer influence than others. The proposed research aims to answer these questions by having a sample of 50 14-19 year olds perform a novel real-stakes social gambling task in the scanner. In this task, participants will make choices about a series of risky gambles, on each trial receiving false information about the decisions of four of their friends who previously completed the task. Using the reported percentage of risk acceptance as a parametric modulator, we will identify regions in the brain where BOLD activation encodes information about others' choice behavior. Second, we will calculate a peer susceptibility score for each subject based on their choices in the task, reflecting how much their choices were swayed by the reported actions of others. We will then use a machine-learning based regression technique to generate a spatial pattern of regression weights that can predict each participant's behavioral susceptibility to peer influence. The strength of these regression weights in different areas of the brain reflects how strongly encoding of others' choices in that region predicts individuals' peer susceptibility scores. These data allow us to: 1) Identify patterns of encoding of others' choice information that are most strongly predictive of being highly susceptible to peer influence, and 2) Generate a neurologic signature that can be used in new samples of participants to predict their level of susceptibility to peer influence. We will then compare predictions of peer susceptibility derived from the brain data to patterns of real-world risk-taking of the participant and their peers. We believe that thes findings can set the stage for future work examining developmental changes in these networks, and how responses in these networks can be altered by exposure to different types of peers or by potential interventions designed to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in specific domains. These avenues of research will allow for the accelerated development of more precise and effective intervention strategies to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in the domain of publi-health relevant risk-taking. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The risky actions of peers strongly influence individuals' risk-taking behavior. This research will examine how information about peers' risky choices are represented in the brain, develop a set of neural markers that can predict the extent to which an individual will be influenced by the actions of their peers, based on their encoding of the peers' choices, and examine relations between these neural markers and susceptibility to peer influence in real-world risk-taking.",The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making,9247017,R21HD086375,"['19 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Choice Behavior', 'Coitus', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Divorce', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Punishment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk-Taking', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Network', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cognitive control', 'effective intervention', 'information processing', 'interest', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'parental involvement', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'therapy design', 'willingness']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2017,190000,-0.022713032981894456
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9301514,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Internships', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2017,293470,-0.001964529066902724
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need.

"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD.

"Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant processing of social and affective information is a severe and disabling symptom across many neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent reports demonstrate that direct electrical brain stimulation (EBS) can alter perception, such as changing the identity of a person being viewed or causing memory-related hallucinations. If EBS can distort normal perception, then EBS using different parameters may be able to normalize SAP, for example by modulating affective salience to visual stimuli in PTSD. One key impediment towards developing EBS as a therapy for SAP pathology is that we lack an understanding of how electrical stimulation modulates neurodynamics and cognition. A critical step towards designing rational EBS-based stimulation parameters for SAP pathology is building a causal model of the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics, interregional interactions, and EBS modulation of these dynamics and interactions during SAP. Visual SAP relies on a neural circuit in the temporal lobe that includes the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Non-invasive brain imaging techniques either lack the temporal resolution to examine millisecond dynamics (fMRI/PET), or are relatively insensitive to activity in deep brain structures such as the amygdala (MEG/EEG/TMS). Direct neural recordings using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy will allow us to overcome these barriers to study the dynamics and interactions in the SAP circuit. Furthermore, delivery of EBS via these implanted electrodes will allow us to examine how electrical modulation of this circuit alters SAP. Using iEEG and advanced analysis methods from machine learning, we recently delineated the set of information processing stages that FG goes through for face perception. In this project, we will test a three- stage dynamic model of the sequence of events and interregional interactions that enable SAP based on these previous results, the work of others, and our preliminary data. We will record iEEG in our regions of interest to test neural dynamics during three critical aspects of social affective processing: perception of facial expression (Aim 1), the inference of actions from motion (Aim 2), and guiding conscious perception to affectively and socially salient stimuli (Aim 3). Then we will employ EBS to modulate perception during these processes. In addition, we will supplement iEEG with magnetoencephalography (MEG), which, while less sensitive to amygdala activity, provides whole-brain cortical coverage and facilitates the comparison of iEEG results to a normative population. The outcome of the proposed research will be a spatially and temporally specific model of the causal dynamics and interactions during SAP. This model will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted EBS therapies that may normalize pathological SAP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Abnormalities in social affective perception are a critical part of the etiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The proposed research will map the detailed neurodynamics of critical aspects of social affective perception and examine how these neurodynamics, and the associated cognitions, can be modulated by brain stimulation. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of social affective perception, a circuit relevant to a number of mental disorders, and take a critical step towards determining how brain stimulation may be used to remediate pathological social affective perception.","Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation",9279262,R01MH107797,"['Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anger', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Body Image', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Perception', 'Feedback', 'Form Perception', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'encephalography', 'evidence base', 'face perception', 'healthy volunteer', 'information processing', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,446302,-0.022470223970589134
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled. PROJECT NARRATIVE The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques as well as automatic clustering approaches based on quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution.

"A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis Project Summary  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a robust hybrid neural-machine interface (NMI), combining brain and muscle signals, to improve overall control of a lower limb prosthetic device during activities of daily living. Limb amputation affects over 600,000 individuals annually in the US, and is a major cause of physical disability that causes activities of daily living to become difficult or impossible for the amputee. The limitations of current lower-limb prostheses are associated with limited volitional control, reduced mobility, and chronic gait abnormalities, which have been linked to exhaustion from increased energy expenditure, increased risk of falling, and degenerative bone and joint disorders in both the intact and amputated limb. In this study, EMG signals from both residual and intact lower limbs and EEG signals from the cortex are leveraged to decode transitions to and from various modes of locomotion modes in able-bodied individuals and transfemoral amputees, and to provide a global understanding of movement at the cortical, muscular, and kinematic level in amputees. Specifically, time and frequency domain features are leveraged to create a prediction algorithm capable of identifying upcoming terrain transitions in advance. In lower limb amputees, this hybrid NMI paradigm translates to volitional control of a powered lower-limb prosthesis, which allows for seamless transitions between various movement conditions. The high-level of control is expected to result in significant increases in level of activity and overall improvements in gait. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of EEG or EMG based NMIs for orthotic and prosthetic devices; however, no study to date has integrated EEG and EMG in a NMI for powered lower limb prostheses. This study is motivated by the need to explore advanced neural control sources for intuitive control of artificial limbs.  This project aligns directly with the Mission & Goals of the NIH, the Brain Initiative, and NIH’s Blueprint Program by expanding fundamental knowledge of neuroscience, human, health and wellness; by utilizing an innovative research strategy; and ultimately returning the knowledge to the public through the development of a highly advanced medical technology. Furthermore, the technology developed through this work has implications beyond the amputee population in the treatment of many neurological conditions and injuries, such as in neurorehabilitation after stroke. The innovation of this project lies in the novel approach of using multimodal neural signals and movement synergies as a framework for interpreting movement of the lower limb. The scientific impact is realized by a greater understanding of the neural correlates of movement after lower-limb amputation. The direct clinical significance for the patient can be measured directly through improved gait performance and walking confidence, leading to increased mobility and a reduced risk of falling, exhaustion, and bone and joint disorders. Project Narrative  The development of a hybrid neural-machine interface that incorporates muscle and brain signaling for communication with robotic systems is important to public health because it allows for robust volitional control of powered prostheses and exoskeletons during activities of daily living. This will directly benefit the amputee population by allowing better control of their prosthesis during locomotion, especially when navigating complex terrains, such as stairs and inclines. The implications of this technology can be used beyond the amputee population to further understand the effect of neurological injuries on the brain, and for improving rehabilitation paradigms associated with their treatment.",A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis,9470585,F99NS105210,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Body Image', 'Bone Diseases', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Electronic Mail', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Agency', 'Future Teacher', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences', 'Oral', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Ramp', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Robotics', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'exhaustion', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'posters', 'powered prosthesis', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rehabilitation paradigm', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot control', 'robot exoskeleton', 'robot rehabilitation', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'undergraduate student', 'visual motor']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,F99,2017,36029,0.0064080586900514035
"Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans ABSTRACT In the course of a day we naturally make multiple shifts in our overall cognitive state and in our aims and intents. We go from sleep to awake, from internal dialogue to external communication, from relative immobility to planned complex movements. The neural activity which distinguishes these different high-level states is unknown and yet is a fundamental aspect to understanding overall cognitive processes. It is also a baseline substrate that is adversely impacted by a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases. Our understanding of human cortical neurophysiology is almost entirely based on cognitive processes examined within the constraints of experimentally controlled tasks with time-locked, stimulus-driven behaviors. However, brain activity is fluid and continuous; much of our essential cognitive activity is not externally triggered but internally generated. The overarching goal of this research is to create platforms which allow for continuous acquisition of high-fidelity neural ensemble activity synchronized with behavioral data and contextual information to allow investigations into volitional changes in focus and intent. Data will be acquired from two groups of patients: those undergoing intracranial exploration for treatment of their epilepsy and patients implanted with multi- electrode arrays as part of the BrainGate clinical trial to restore communication and mobility to people with paralysis. Using this novel paradigm for investigation, we will explore the neural basis for changes in state which are dominated by receptive activities, internal thought and external interaction. We initially focus on motor behavior with a traditional task construction constraining the participant to watch, imagine and then attempt or actually move. We expand this to spontaneous activity in Aim 2. Finally, we move toward more general and abstracted investigations of volitional state by looking at an analogous task and spontaneous behavior with respect to language and communication (Aim 3). At each stage we will employ spectral, functional connectivity and data mining techniques to understand the neural underpinnings of these different states as well as the temporal dynamics that portend changes in state. Supporting all of these aims will be improvements and expansions in state-of-the-art human micro- and mesoscale neural recording environments to enable the study of continuous, real-time neural activity underlying state changes. Across aims we will explore the extent to which motor cortex alone contains the information which may be present in more widespread and higher order cortical regions. Our hypothesis is that motor cortex, does in fact, encode significant information about state in ways which encapsulate or summarize the information available in more wide spread regions. Most importantly, the questions inherent in this research are key to understanding human thought patterns at a fundamental level. This understanding has important implications not just for basic cognitive neuroscience but for our understanding of the processes which are altered in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, the dementias, depression, and psychosis. The results of these studies are also essential for the practical instantiation of effective brain-machine interfaces which would allow patients to act autonomously. Narrative: From simple decisions to more significant and complex thoughts, we constantly shift our aims and intentions and the degree to which we are interacting externally or internally. Understanding these shifts is key to the development of truly autonomous brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics as well as to understanding how these kinds of alterations can be compromised in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. In this project we go beyond routine cognitive studies based on constrained stimulus response designs and instead utilize continuous recordings of neural activity during spontaneous behavior to decode changes in volitional state during motor activity and communication.",Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans,9356342,U01NS098968,"['Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Microelectrodes', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Volition', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'data mining', 'design', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroprosthesis', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2017,1528951,0.01114228885501855
"Compressive Light Field microscopy for optogenetic neural activity tracking SUMMARY: Understanding the mechanisms by which the living brain derives perception, cognition and behavior requires the ability to record and control electrical activity in many neurons simultaneously. Completely reconstructing the pattern of neural activity that mediates a specific neural operation is critical for fully understanding its underlying mechanism. This requires an approach that can measure neural activity on a large scale with high spatial and temporal resolution. Functional imaging of genetically encoded activity sensors is one of the most promising avenues towards achieving this goal because it permits dense sampling and unambiguous separation of nearby neurons1, 2. However, even techniques currently available cannot capture neural activity in large volumes of the brain simultaneously, at high speed, and with cellular resolution. Furthermore, these existing approaches rely on expensive and sophisticated hardware, and cannot be readily adapted for imaging in unrestrained animals. Since a central goal of the BRAIN initiative is to achieve large-scale recording of neural activity in behaving animals, a new imaging approach is needed to overcome these technical challenges.  To achieve high speed, volumetric imaging in a compact and inexpensive device, we propose to develop a new imaging modality - compressive four-dimensional (4D) light field microscopy (LFM). In this approach, we will combine the advantages of light field microscopy with compressed sensing to extract the activity of thousands of individual neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution, through scattering tissue. In conventional microscopy, the photo-detector only samples the intensity of photons. In LFM, the sensor also captures the angle of the light. This allows 3D reconstruction, since position and angle enable back-tracing of rays of light. Such a scheme can be achieved simply by placing a lenslet array in the imaging pathway (Fig. 1A). The resulting 4D light field gives complete volumetric data at each time frame3-6. 3D activity can thus be sampled at camera-limited frame rates, much faster than conventional methods such as multiphoton or light sheet microscopy. For these reasons, LFM for functional brain imaging could revolutionize experimental neuroscience.  Unfortunately, imaging methods which operate in the one-photon regime suffer from light scattering. To image activity in the mammalian brain, we must consider the effects of tissue scattering through the 3D volume. We propose to apply a new approach to processing light field data for better reconstructions of neurons through scattering media37,38. Since the effect of scattering is to spread the angles of propagation of light, measuring angle information inherently helps to characterize and mitigate scatter effects. Our method leverages compressed sensing algorithms, which exploit the sparsity of the light emission in 3D space and time. Importantly, the volume and resolution limits of our method are not set by the number of pixels captured, but rather by the number of active neurons at any given time. Thus, we will be able to localize and measure the activity of thousands or millions of individually active neurons in large volumes of cerebral cortical tissue. Project Narrative This project will develop new optical imaging techniques for real-time neural activity tracking across large volumes of scattering brain tissue. The tool developed will enable new experiments in mapping and understanding how neurons work together for functional behavior in the cortex of the brain.",Compressive Light Field microscopy for optogenetic neural activity tracking,9360616,R21EY027597,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrum', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Devices', 'Electrodes', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Records Controls', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensory', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'awake', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'experimental study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'in vivo', 'light emission', 'light scattering', 'multiphoton imaging', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'optical imaging', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R21,2017,196420,-0.02574136923677836
"Large-scale Network Modeling for Brain Dynamics: Statistical Learning and Optimization Summary The human brain is a large, well-connected, and dynamic network. Using functional MRI data, modeling how this network processes the stimulus information has yielded insight on some of the mechanisms of the brain. However, the past efforts, including ours, on using small-scale models yielded limited understanding of how the complete and dynamic neural system functions in task-related experiments. Such understanding cannot be recovered from the data without substantial and collaborative efforts on model development. Towards this goal, we formed a collaborative team from modelers to end-users, and we will develop large-scale methods for task related fMRI (tfMRI), including event-related fMRI, to model whole-brain network dynamics responding to task challenges. Using modern statistical learning principals and large-scale optimization algorithms, we will develop novel methods to model nonlinear, spatial-temporal dependence in high dimensional data of fMRI, stimuli, and behavior outcomes. We will primarily base our methods in the regularized, constrained graphical model (GM) framework, a promising multivariate framework for inferring brain connectivity that has been validated by simulation and anatomical studies. Using this framework, we will develop novel methods to investigate, at a large scale, how changes in connectivity and activation are driven by task challenges and how multiple brain pathways process stimulus information. We will perform comprehensive validation and assessment of the newly developed methods, using both simulated and multiple tfMRI data from large cohorts. Using the scale of modeling that previous approaches cannot readily address without substantial time penalties and maybe also inaccuracies, our collaborative team will also use these methods to investigate various novel questions and hypotheses concerning the neural basis for cognitive control as one of the use cases. We will also develop publicly available, open source implementations for a broad range of use in the neuroimaging community. These modeling efforts will lead to new insights on the networks of large-scale neural circuits, and provide pharmacological targets that may be overlooked using small-scale models.     PUBLIC RELEVANCE STATEMENT We propose a foundational framework for modeling whole-brain network dynamics.

"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA,9238503,R01MH064537,"['Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gaussian model', 'Grant', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'parallel processing', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'source localization', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'trend']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,378758,0.009592300535684021
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network (Administrative Supplement) Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts.

"Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks. Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy, which affects nearly 4% of the population over their lifetime, roughly one third of afflicted patients are incompletely responsive to anticonvulsant drugs, requiring in severe cases neurosurgical resections or novel approaches such as deep-brain stimulation (DBS). Recently, I helped develop an electrophysiology-based online DBS protocol for seizure detection and interruption in rodent models of absence epilepsy, a form of epilepsy involving aberrant thalamocortical activity. However, like other online DBS procedures which detect seizures as they occur, there was little ability to predict incipient seizures due in large part to limited spatiotemporal resolution of the signal we used, the electrocorticogram (ECoG). ECoG and related electroencephalogram (EEG), being large scale local field potential approaches, do not provide single-cell resolution of neural dynamics that are likely required to obtain predictive information. Over the last decade, the field of brain-machine interface (BMI) has made breakthroughs in neuroscience and engineering by developing methods for multi-electrode array recording of large scale neural spiking activity and efficient reduction of the resultant high-dimensional neural activity to a smaller number of dimensions to effectively control neural prostheses. We predict that this approach will be invaluable for understanding neural dynamics during seizures and stimulation, and for developing predictive algorithms and adaptive DBS protocols.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to precisely characterize thalamocortical neural activity during spontaneous absence seizures and following thalamic stimulation by combining large-scale thalamic and cortical neural recordings, optogenetics, and BMI mathematical techniques. Additionally, the experiments presented in this proposal will use the recorded neural activity to develop adaptive algorithms that both predict oncoming seizure activity and modify stimulation parameters based on the neural state and response to stimulation in real-time. This proposal is aimed towards increasing our understanding of the neural dynamics of epileptic networks and improving the efficacy and safety of online DBS. Roughly one third of epileptic patients are resistant to pharmacological treatment, which has promoted the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a means to detect and prevent seizures. However, the neural activity underlying epileptic discharges and the effects of DBS on this activity are poorly understood, partially due to the limited information carried by the EEG signals used for monitoring seizures. A more precise characterization of epileptic neural circuits is crucial to improve current DBS design and enhance the sensitivity and efficacy of seizure detection and disruption, which demands the tools and resources of basic research.",Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks.,9257233,F31NS100265,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Generalized seizures', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'markov model', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,0.01970950349744672
"Neural and Kinematic Features of Freezing of Gait for Adaptive Neurostimulation PROJECT SUMMARY Freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) results in unpredictable episodes of gait cessation, which may lead to falls, injury, a loss of independent living, and even death19. The treatment of FOG is inconsistent with either dopaminergic medication or with current open loop, continuous high frequency deep brain stimulation (cDBS)15, 25. Emerging technology using non-continuous, closed loop or adaptive DBS (aDBS), has the potential to improve treatment for FOG. Adaptive DBS can sense patient specific neural and/or kinematic signals and respond by adjusting DBS parameters to provide more efficacious therapy while reducing adverse side effects known to occur with cDBS. The critical barriers of using aDBS for FOG are the lack of knowledge of: the neural features of FOG that could be ‘sensed’ by aDBS to trigger stimulation, the optimal, patient specific DBS parameters for the treatment of FOG, and whether aDBS for FOG is safe and tolerable in human PD patients. In the Bronte-Stewart Lab, we have the technology, the regulatory approvals and the research experience collecting synchronized neural and quantitative kinematic signals, applying different DBS parameters for FOG, performing the first aDBS experiments in freely moving PD subjects. The Bronte-Stewart Lab was the first group and Stanford was the first site in the United States to implant a sensing neurostimulator for PD, the Activa® PC+S (Medtronic Inc., FDA IDE/Stanford IRB approval, October 2013). This comprised the FDA approved neurostimulator (Activa PC®, Medtronic Inc.) with additional software that enabled recording of brain signals via telemetry from the neurostimulator itself. We have implanted twenty PD patients (largest cohort in the world), from whom we have been collecting synchronized neural and computerized kinematic signals for over thirty months without adverse events. We will use this new technology in conjunction with our expertise in quantitative kinematics and validated measure of FOG to begin understanding the neural features associated with FOG. In addition, we will use quantitative measures of FOG to accurately determine the efficacy of patient specific stimulation parameters for effective and consistent treatment of FOG. No center has had the technological capability to test the safety and feasibility of aDBS for FOG in freely moving PD patients. Whether patients can tolerate aDBS, which continually adjusts output to control a time-varying patient-specific neural signal as they are walking and moving freely is completely unknown and will be assessed in a pilot study in this proposal. This project is expected to signal the beginning of a new era of precise medicine: the possibility to treat FOG in PD in a customized, adaptive manner, while minimizing adverse effects and complementing the treatment of other disabling motor features of PD such as tremor. PROJECT NARRATIVE Freezing of gait (FOG), a severe complication of Parkinson’s disease that could result in falls and even death, is not consistently well treated with current one-size fits all continuous deep brain stimulation therapy. Newly available adaptive DBS (aDBS) provides an opportunity to improve treatment of FOG by delivering precise medicine; real-time patient specific stimulation that is driven by patient specific neural signals. The goals of this project are to perform an in-depth analysis of the synchronized neural and kinematic data of freely moving patients, while stimulating with various settings to (1) better define these poorly understood patient specific signals and effective stimulation settings, and (2) to perform a pilot study to determine the safety and feasibility of whether patients can tolerate aDBS which continually adjusts the stimulation output.",Neural and Kinematic Features of Freezing of Gait for Adaptive Neurostimulation,9360002,R21NS096398,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Bradykinesia', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complication', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dorsal', 'Electrodes', 'Emerging Technologies', 'FDA approved', 'Fall injury', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Independent Living', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Safety', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'cohort', 'comparative efficacy', 'computerized', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'human subject', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'motor disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'new technology', 'patient safety', 'place fields', 'relating to nervous system', 'safety and feasibility', 'safety testing', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard care']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,196250,0.0279175191701748
"Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control Project Summary/Abstract  Millions of people suffer from some form of paralysis. In most of these cases the connection between the brain and the spinal cord is damaged, however, the motor cortex is healthy and intact. Thus, for these individuals, brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) hold significant promise for improving quality of life. BMIs decode an individual's intention to move by utilizing statistical models of neural activity patterns recorded from the motor cortex using implanted electrode arrays. While these methods have been encouraging in preclinical experiments and clinical trials for controlling thought-driven 2D computer cursors, they suffer from poor performance when applied to higher degrees-of-freedom (e.g., robotic limbs), and are not robust to the inevitable degradation of the electrode array. In order to address these clinical needs, this project starts from the recent observation that just as some behaviors are easier to learn, some patterns of neural activity, termed neural states, are also easier to generate. The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate if these “easy to generate” neural states can be used to robustly control a prosthetic arm. This is a significant departure from current decoding methods, which incorporate little to no information about the motor system, especially its ability to learn and adapt. The first major aim of this work is to develop experiments and analysis methods in order to find these “easy to generate” neural states in the non- human primate (i.e., rhesus monkey) motor system. Here “easy to generate” can be understood as the monkey's ability to volitionally generate that particular neural state. The second major aim of this work is to characterize the properties of the motor system that enable some states to be more easily generated than others. Prior work in our lab has shown that motor cortical population activity has well-defined structure, as predicted by dynamical system theory. These dynamics cause neural states to evolve in lawful ways through time. The work here will extend these findings by characterizing the dynamics associated with a monkey learning to generate a neural state. Finally, the third major aim of this work is to determine if neural states that monkeys can volitionally generate can be utilized for robust control of a prosthetic arm. The central hypothesis of this work is that building a model that only utilizes firing patterns that can be easily generated (as determined experimentally) will enable robust and high-performance control of a prosthetic arm. If successful, this study could have significant clinical impact by presenting a new paradigm to enable robust control of a prosthesis. Project Narrative  Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injuries or neurodegenerative diseases that result in considerable movement impairment. Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) hold considerable promise in drastically improving the quality of life for these individuals, who otherwise have very limited treatment options. This work will investigate the motor system's ability to learn and adapt, and directly use these insights to build robust high degree-of-freedom BMIs for clinical applications.",Neural dynamics and adaption for brain machine interface control,9395809,F31NS103409,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Arm', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Robotics', 'Spinal Cord', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Volition', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'brain machine interface', 'clinical application', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'motor impairment', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'pre-clinical', 'prosthesis control', 'rehearsal', 'relating to nervous system']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,33584,-0.000735073000374432
"Neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern perception Project Summary/Abstract: Processing acoustic communication signals is among the most difficult, yet vital capabilities that the auditory system must achieve. These abilities lie at the heart of language and speech processing, and their success or failure can have profound impacts on quality of life across the lifespan. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, as well as improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. While much has been learned about the loci of language-related processing using non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans, these techniques cannot answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. As a result, the explicit cellular circuit-level and neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing are poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language, in particular the processing of temporal patterns within communication signals. The experiments outlined in this proposal investigate the neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent speech sounds (phonemes) can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Sensitivity to transition statistics is not exclusive to speech signals however, but reflects general auditory processes shared by many animals. In Aim 1 we investigate the categorical perception of complex auditory objects in populations of cortical neurons in an animal model, and ask how these neural representations are effected by temporal context. In addition to which elements occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Studies in Aim 2 focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. In Aim 3, we propose a basic circuit in which population level representations of auditory objects could be differentially modulated by patterning rules, and test this proposed pattern processing circuit using direct, casual manipulations. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern perception,9527903,R56DC016408,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Birds', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Technique', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transition Elements', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'bird song', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'language processing', 'microstimulation', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'pattern perception', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R56,2017,363607,-0.08419502477953357
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9277595,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,825202,0.020963974872952734
"Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understanding how stored memories change as a function of experience. The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weaker—it can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia. In all of these conditions, cogni- tive deficits can arise from insufficient separation of representations. This research may lead to better ways of re-differentiating these representations and—through this—ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits. NARRATIVE This work has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of when learning decreases overlap between memories in the brain (differentiation) or increases overlap (integration). Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dementia, and dyslexia: In all of these conditions, cognitive deficits can arise when there is insufficient neural separation of memories or concepts (e.g., temporal lobe stroke can “collapse” stored visual knowledge, preventing retrieval of names of common objects). The learning models and interventions developed here may eventually lead to new and better ways of re-differentiating these collapsed representa- tions and ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits.","Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning",9354513,R01MH069456,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Running', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'behavioral study', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'memory retrieval', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'phonology', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,455418,-0.006850385124449913
"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,9327009,R00HD076166,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neonatology', 'Neural Pathways', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'aged', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive development', 'comparison group', 'developmental disease', 'early experience', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'infancy', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'visual stimulus']",NICHD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R00,2017,242522,0.014114407586407052
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,9303234,R00AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R00,2017,249000,-0.003700579319629967
"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis. NARRATIVE  In this project we will develop a filtered point process framework for neural data analysis, with models and algorithms for sparse recovery of spike-trains from time-series data comprising a series of pulsed waveforms. We will use this novel methodology to extract neuronal spike-trains from calcium imaging data of cortical tissue, and to estimate hormone secretion times and amounts from serum hormone levels. We will make our mathematical algorithms for neural data analysis and their software implementation freely and easily available to the neuroscience research community.",Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data,9360116,R01EB022726,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Corticotropin', 'Coupled', 'Cushing Syndrome', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Endocrine system', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Life', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Noise', 'Osteoporosis', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathologic', 'Periodicity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Somatotropin', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'V1 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'area striata', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mathematical algorithm', 'movie', 'neural model', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual cognition', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2017,332220,-0.003747541881594489
"Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and translation to neuroprosthetics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences.  Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living.  We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern of interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks.  Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 μm diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1).  More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks.  We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks.  The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control.  We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2).  This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom.  We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding.  This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints.  This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb.

"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9470632,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2017,33050,-0.012916035396327767
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9618453,R01NS063399,[' '],NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,273292,0.011827553957879506

One of the significant challenges with DBS is patient-specific dosimetry of stimulation settings to efficiently achieve a strong and consistent therapeutic effect.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,9107487,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'neurotransmission', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,230351,0.013830825296425656
"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program will establish new framework for understanding the cognitive neuroscience architecture of scene perception, with the aim of unraveling how the human brain analyzes the geometry and functionality of visual environment in order to guide our actions and navigation in the world.            ",Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene,9006938,R01EY026042,"['4 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Floor', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visuospatial', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'vector']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,366529,0.005615480834963632
"The neural workings of self-initiated and quasi-automatic movements ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncovering the principles behind the generation of voluntary movements is a necessary first step in the development of technologies and treatments aimed at restoring motor abilities lost to neurological disease or trauma. The aim of this project is to shed light on the neural mechanisms of voluntary movement initiation. An essential component of voluntary movement is the choice of when to act. Under normal circumstances this decision can be time consuming usually taking up to a few hundreds of milliseconds, longer that the known delays in the nervous system. The area of the brain most associated with generating movements, the motor cortex, becomes very active just before and during the movement, however what exactly is happening during this time is still not well understood. Indeed, while much is known about the neural basis of generating movements, several open questions remain: does a movement generated deliberately with no time pressure, like a reach made to grab an object from a table, share the same neural underpinnings with a very fast reach to catch a falling object? Will the motor cortex be just as active before a quasi-automatic reach when time is of the essence? Or is pre-movement activity only present when there is enough time to deliberately plan the movement? During movement itself, is motor cortex involved in generating quasi-automatic reaches or is there is some reflex mechanism that bypasses motor cortex to generate urgent reaches? To begin answering these questions we have trained two monkeys to initiate a reach under three very different circumstances: sometimes monkeys move at a time of their own choosing with no imposed time constraints, other times monkeys must intercept a rapidly moving target on a screen, which elicits very short-latency reaches. In yet another set of trials monkeys must withhold a reach until given a go cue. The first aim of this project is to determine if these three movements (self-initiated, quasi-automatic and cue-initiated) share a common neural mechanism that does not depend on how the movement is initiated. To do this we will record the responses from a number of neurons in two key regions of the motor cortex: the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortex. In order to understand and interpret these responses, we will employ cutting edge machine learning techniques that will allow us to visualize and quantify the how neural activity evolves in time. Being able to visualize the evolution of neural activity is a key component in understanding the principles that govern how the neural activity translates to movement. The second aim of this project is to elucidate the role that higher cortical areas play in the generation of voluntar movements. We will record neural activity from areas upstream of motor cortex (supplementary motor area), which is heavily interconnected with the motor cortex and is suspected to play crucial a role in determining when a movement should be initiated. We will test record neural activity from this area and characterize its properties using the same cutting edge techniques developed in the first part of this project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Uncovering the principles behind the generation of voluntary movements is a necessary first step in the development of technologies and treatments aimed at restoring motor abilities lost to neurological disease or trauma. Arguably, one of the fundamental features of voluntary movement is that one chooses when to move. The main goal of the proposed project is to shed light on the neural mechanisms responsible for voluntary movement initiation.                ",The neural workings of self-initiated and quasi-automatic movements,9148079,F32NS092350,"['Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Bypass', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dorsal', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Intercept', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Property Rights', 'Reflex action', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'grasp', 'millisecond', 'motor control', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2016,21140,-0.01369109198983071
"Modelling Rett Syndrome in Vascularized Neural Assemblies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body. This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials.

"Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI is a faculty member of the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Stony Brook. His research focuses on spontaneous and evoked neural activity in the gustatory cortex. The candidate recently transitioned to neuroscience from a theoretical physics background. This award will provide the necessary five-year protected period for the candidate to receive training in systems and theoretical neuroscience and electrophysiological techniques, under the supervision of the proposed mentorship committee. By the end of the termed period, the candidate will achieve his long term career goals of successfully applying for independent research funding and becoming an independent investigator in the field of theoretical neuroscience. The goal of the proposed research plan is elucidating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity in the gustatory cortex, and its modulation by anticipatory cues. Spontaneous neural activity in sensory cortices, traditionally regarded as a noisy baseline, is increasingly drawing attention: it can predict trial to trial variability; it contains information on the functional architecture of neural networks; and it was characterized as either a ""repertoire"" of possible network activities or a storage of expectations of sensory stimuli, shaped by development. In the context of taste processing, however, it has received little to no attention. The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the properties of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex. This is an ideal system, due to the rich temporal dynamics of responses to taste stimuli, represented in terms of taste-specific sequences of patterns of activity, synchronized across the whole neural population. The first goal of the proposed plan is to employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to elucidate the features of spontaneous activity in relation to evoked activity. This will provide new analytical tools for the characterization of spontaneous activity and reconcile within a single framework the different views currently held in the literature, by introducing the new feature of temporal dynamics. As a second goal of the proposed project, the role played by anticipatory cues in modulating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity will be elucidated, and the dependence of reaction times on spontaneous activity will be clarified. A biologically plausible model of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex will be introduced, based on networks of spiking neurons. This model will yield a mechanistic understanding of the feature of spontaneous activity as revealed by the analysis of electrophysiological data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is designed to uncover the dynamical features of spontaneous neural activity in the gustatory cortex and to elucidate its role in modulating the processing of taste---related information under different behavioral contexts. The relation between spontaneous and stimulus---evoked activities is the active subject of debate in the neuroscience literature; this project will develop novel analytical and modeling tools aimed at clarifying the extent to which spontaneous and evoked activity are intertwined. The results of this effort will provide a new perspective on the cortical mechanism underlying taste processing in normal conditions, and bears important implications on issues related to public health, such as the role played by attention in food consumption disorders.",Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex,9089992,K25DC013557,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taste Perception', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebrates', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'career', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'food consumption', 'markov model', 'member', 'millisecond', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'stem', 'taste stimuli', 'tool']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,K25,2016,167410,-0.014349490553926255
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,8996729,R01NS063399,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2016,308040,0.011827553957879506
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience.

To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning. Deep understanding of sensory-motor systems will aid in development of new treatment modalities for diseases that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. n/a","CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling",9242184,R01NS100049,"['Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Huntington Disease', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'control theory', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional plasticity', 'information processing', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mathematical analysis', 'medical schools', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'research study', 'sensorimotor system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,205290,-0.007946905187600682
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9021699,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Resected', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2016,531286,-0.002722081473028863
"Translating from Rats to Humans: A Human Foraging Model of Decision-Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Animal models of addiction are some of the most highly regarded models of psychopathology.  As a result, treatments for humans are often developed based on animal addiction models.  However, there remains a disconnection between these pre-clinical models and treatment outcomes.  Some researchers suggest that the gap in translating pre-clinical to clinical models stems from untested assumptions that different species recruit the same cognitive substrates on the modeled tasks.  Therefore, there is a need for research than can verify that animal and human decision-making systems are comparable, which in turn, could improve the generalizability of results across these research stages.  Effective translational paradigms are needed to test similarities (or differences) in cognitive processes across species.  The present proposal introduces a novel experiential foraging paradigm for humans, which was designed based on a go/no-go foraging paradigm for rats (Restaurant Row).  In the Restaurant Row paradigm, an animal has a fixed amount of time to traverse a circular track collecting food rewards after variable delay times from different ""restaurants."" This paradigm successfully captured individual differences in preference, as well as behavioral and neural signatures of emotional constructs (e.g.  regret, disappointment).  In the proposed human variant (called the Web-Surf task), humans make a series of go/no-go decisions as they travel between video galleries that present different types of video clips after variable delays.  The human variant was designed to mimic the rat variant while also considering natural human ethology.  Preliminary analyses in human subjects suggest the two paradigms capture similar behavioral mechanisms.  The first aim of the proposed project is to examine whether the Web- Surf task equivalently measures emotional constructs, such as regret.  The first aim also seeks to elucidate whether individual differences in behavioral task performance map onto variations in impulsive traits.  The second aim of the proposed project is to determine whether the Web-Surf task captures neural signatures of deliberation and emotional processing as seen in rats.  This will be accomplished using general linear modeling and machine learning approaches for processing functional neuroimaging data.  This task could be pivotal in reducing the gap between pre-clinical and clinical research, and more importantly, advancing the development of addiction treatments for humans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Animal models of addiction are some of the most highly regarded models of psychopathology; however, there remains a disconnection between these pre-clinical models and treatment outcomes.  This division may be, in part, due to untested assumptions that different species recruit the same cognitive systems in the compared tasks.  The novel research outlined in this proposal will help improve the translation between human and nonhuman animal models, and in turn, improve treatment efficacy for these disorders.                ",Translating from Rats to Humans: A Human Foraging Model of Decision-Making,9185215,F31DA040335,"['Accounting', 'Advanced Development', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clip', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Ethology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Food', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regrets', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Students', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'addiction', 'analog', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'human subject', 'improved', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'pre-clinical', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'stem', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'willingness']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2016,36927,-0.01764673151626902
"Neural Signatures of Bipolar Disorder across Depression and Remission Project Summary  Bipolar disorder is characterized by variability in mood symptoms and cognitive impairment which leads to functional impairment both during depression and even during periods of remission. A major clinical challenge is that patients exhibit substantial variability in treatment response despite having the same clinical diagnosis, which suggests heterogeneity in underlying neurobiological dysfunction. In this R03, our aims are to deﬁne speciﬁc frontal- cingulate cognitive control and amygdala-frontal emotion regulatory neural clusters in brain activation and connectivity using dimensional tasks of cognitive control and acute threat. We will also develop neurocognitive and emotional proﬁles of the neural clusters we identify.  To accomplish our aims, we will analyze an existing dataset of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, obtained in previous NIMH studies at the UCLA Mood Disorders Research Program, from bipolar disorder subjects (65 remitted and 21 depressed) and 65 healthy controls. We will use a novel approach, called Dimensional Neural Clustering, to classify fMRI data. Our approach is based on techniques used in other serious illnesses with multiply- determined outcomes, such as breast cancer, that have revolutionized treatment by identifying subgroups and made invaluable life-saving contributions. After computing brain activation and connectivity associated with the neural circuits underlying cognitive control (activated by response inhibition) and acute threat (activated by emotion regulation), we will use Dimensional Neural Clustering to identify subgroups of patients. Dimensional Neural Clustering differs from previous machine-learning approaches because we will use neurobiology to deﬁne subgroups of patients, rather than to classify patients based on a clinical diagnosis.  We hypothesize that patients can be classiﬁed based on inhibitory and regulatory neural clusters. Moreover, the neural clusters will be associated with differential phenotypic expression characterized by neurocognitive performance, mood/anxiety symptoms, and the ability to reappraise/suppress emotion. Our demonstration of neural subtypes of bipolar disorder will provide a basis for a neurobiologically-driven approach to understanding bipolar disorder, on which we can elaborate in future dimensional work. Our ﬁndings will provide a foundation for future work to personalize treatment. People diagnosed with bipolar disorder experience different disease symptoms and have varied responses to treatments for depressive episodes. Such variability within patients who have the same clinical diagnosis suggests signiﬁcant underlying neural heterogeneity that is not captured by current diagnostic criteria. We will implement a novel approach that uses functional neuroimaging data to generate a neurobiologically-driven classiﬁcation of people with bipolar disorder to guide future work in personalizing treatment.",Neural Signatures of Bipolar Disorder across Depression and Remission,9169470,R03MH110877,"['Acute', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Down-Regulation', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'depressive symptoms', 'disease phenotype', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'statistics', 'success', 'sugar', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2016,77000,-0.013155719464622283
"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.

"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,9134137,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Contusions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'somatosensory', 'treadmill', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2016,1090691,0.03531586663730409
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions. Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects,9099855,R01EY022727,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Stroke', 'Swimming Pools', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'coping', 'data mining', 'distraction', 'flexibility', 'goal oriented behavior', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'support network', 'sustained attention', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,368557,-0.010068696044064344
"The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risky behaviors such as smoking, drug and alcohol use, and teenaged sexual intercourse are all heavily influenced by the behaviors of one's peers. While much is known about the neural networks involved in risky decision-making, this research has largely been conducted in the absence of the rich network of social information available when making risky decisions in real-life. Given the large body of evidence suggesting the importance of information about peers' choices when making risky decisions, it is of great public-health relevance to understand how the integration of this information into the risky decision takes place at the neural level, and, particularly, what differences in processing of this information lead some people to be more susceptible to peer influence than others. The proposed research aims to answer these questions by having a sample of 50 14-19 year olds perform a novel real-stakes social gambling task in the scanner. In this task, participants will make choices about a series of risky gambles, on each trial receiving false information about the decisions of four of their friends who previously completed the task. Using the reported percentage of risk acceptance as a parametric modulator, we will identify regions in the brain where BOLD activation encodes information about others' choice behavior. Second, we will calculate a peer susceptibility score for each subject based on their choices in the task, reflecting how much their choices were swayed by the reported actions of others. We will then use a machine-learning based regression technique to generate a spatial pattern of regression weights that can predict each participant's behavioral susceptibility to peer influence. The strength of these regression weights in different areas of the brain reflects how strongly encoding of others' choices in that region predicts individuals' peer susceptibility scores. These data allow us to: 1) Identify patterns of encoding of others' choice information that are most strongly predictive of being highly susceptible to peer influence, and 2) Generate a neurologic signature that can be used in new samples of participants to predict their level of susceptibility to peer influence. We will then compare predictions of peer susceptibility derived from the brain data to patterns of real-world risk-taking of the participant and their peers. We believe that thes findings can set the stage for future work examining developmental changes in these networks, and how responses in these networks can be altered by exposure to different types of peers or by potential interventions designed to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in specific domains. These avenues of research will allow for the accelerated development of more precise and effective intervention strategies to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in the domain of publi-health relevant risk-taking.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The risky actions of peers strongly influence individuals' risk-taking behavior. This research will examine how information about peers' risky choices are represented in the brain, develop a set of neural markers that can predict the extent to which an individual will be influenced by the actions of their peers, based on their encoding of the peers' choices, and examine relations between these neural markers and susceptibility to peer influence in real-world risk-taking.        ",The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making,9112119,R21HD086375,"['19 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Choice Behavior', 'Coitus', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Divorce', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Punishment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk-Taking', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Network', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cognitive control', 'effective intervention', 'information processing', 'interest', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'parental involvement', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'therapy design', 'underage drinking', 'willingness']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2016,228000,-0.022713032981894456
"Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant processing of social and affective information is a severe and disabling symptom across many neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent reports demonstrate that direct electrical brain stimulation (EBS) can alter perception, such as changing the identity of a person being viewed or causing memory-related hallucinations. If EBS can distort normal perception, then EBS using different parameters may be able to normalize SAP, for example by modulating affective salience to visual stimuli in PTSD. One key impediment towards developing EBS as a therapy for SAP pathology is that we lack an understanding of how electrical stimulation modulates neurodynamics and cognition. A critical step towards designing rational EBS-based stimulation parameters for SAP pathology is building a causal model of the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics, interregional interactions, and EBS modulation of these dynamics and interactions during SAP. Visual SAP relies on a neural circuit in the temporal lobe that includes the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Non-invasive brain imaging techniques either lack the temporal resolution to examine millisecond dynamics (fMRI/PET), or are relatively insensitive to activity in deep brain structures such as the amygdala (MEG/EEG/TMS). Direct neural recordings using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy will allow us to overcome these barriers to study the dynamics and interactions in the SAP circuit. Furthermore, delivery of EBS via these implanted electrodes will allow us to examine how electrical modulation of this circuit alters SAP. Using iEEG and advanced analysis methods from machine learning, we recently delineated the set of information processing stages that FG goes through for face perception. In this project, we will test a three- stage dynamic model of the sequence of events and interregional interactions that enable SAP based on these previous results, the work of others, and our preliminary data. We will record iEEG in our regions of interest to test neural dynamics during three critical aspects of social affective processing: perception of facial expression (Aim 1), the inference of actions from motion (Aim 2), and guiding conscious perception to affectively and socially salient stimuli (Aim 3). Then we will employ EBS to modulate perception during these processes. In addition, we will supplement iEEG with magnetoencephalography (MEG), which, while less sensitive to amygdala activity, provides whole-brain cortical coverage and facilitates the comparison of iEEG results to a normative population. The outcome of the proposed research will be a spatially and temporally specific model of the causal dynamics and interactions during SAP. This model will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted EBS therapies that may normalize pathological SAP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Abnormalities in social affective perception are a critical part of the etiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The proposed research will map the detailed neurodynamics of critical aspects of social affective perception and examine how these neurodynamics, and the associated cognitions, can be modulated by brain stimulation. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of social affective perception, a circuit relevant to a number of mental disorders, and take a critical step towards determining how brain stimulation may be used to remediate pathological social affective perception.","Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation",9120413,R01MH107797,"['Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Body Image', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Perception', 'Feedback', 'Figs - dietary', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Social Perception', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'encephalography', 'evidence base', 'face perception', 'healthy volunteer', 'information gathering', 'information processing', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,446302,-0.022470223970589134

"Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans ABSTRACT In the course of a day we naturally make multiple shifts in our overall cognitive state and in our aims and intents. We go from sleep to awake, from internal dialogue to external communication, from relative immobility to planned complex movements. The neural activity which distinguishes these different high-level states is unknown and yet is a fundamental aspect to understanding overall cognitive processes. It is also a baseline substrate that is adversely impacted by a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases. Our understanding of human cortical neurophysiology is almost entirely based on cognitive processes examined within the constraints of experimentally controlled tasks with time-locked, stimulus-driven behaviors. However, brain activity is fluid and continuous; much of our essential cognitive activity is not externally triggered but internally generated. The overarching goal of this research is to create platforms which allow for continuous acquisition of high-fidelity neural ensemble activity synchronized with behavioral data and contextual information to allow investigations into volitional changes in focus and intent. Data will be acquired from two groups of patients: those undergoing intracranial exploration for treatment of their epilepsy and patients implanted with multi- electrode arrays as part of the BrainGate clinical trial to restore communication and mobility to people with paralysis. Using this novel paradigm for investigation, we will explore the neural basis for changes in state which are dominated by receptive activities, internal thought and external interaction. We initially focus on motor behavior with a traditional task construction constraining the participant to watch, imagine and then attempt or actually move. We expand this to spontaneous activity in Aim 2. Finally, we move toward more general and abstracted investigations of volitional state by looking at an analogous task and spontaneous behavior with respect to language and communication (Aim 3). At each stage we will employ spectral, functional connectivity and data mining techniques to understand the neural underpinnings of these different states as well as the temporal dynamics that portend changes in state. Supporting all of these aims will be improvements and expansions in state-of-the-art human micro- and mesoscale neural recording environments to enable the study of continuous, real-time neural activity underlying state changes. Across aims we will explore the extent to which motor cortex alone contains the information which may be present in more widespread and higher order cortical regions. Our hypothesis is that motor cortex, does in fact, encode significant information about state in ways which encapsulate or summarize the information available in more wide spread regions. Most importantly, the questions inherent in this research are key to understanding human thought patterns at a fundamental level. This understanding has important implications not just for basic cognitive neuroscience but for our understanding of the processes which are altered in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, the dementias, depression, and psychosis. The results of these studies are also essential for the practical instantiation of effective brain-machine interfaces which would allow patients to act autonomously. Narrative: From simple decisions to more significant and complex thoughts, we constantly shift our aims and intentions and the degree to which we are interacting externally or internally. Understanding these shifts is key to the development of truly autonomous brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics as well as to understanding how these kinds of alterations can be compromised in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. In this project we go beyond routine cognitive studies based on constrained stimulus response designs and instead utilize continuous recordings of neural activity during spontaneous behavior to decode changes in volitional state during motor activity and communication.",Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans,9205859,U01NS098968,"['Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Microelectrodes', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sleep', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Volition', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'insight', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2016,1443240,0.01114228885501855
"Large-scale Network Modeling for Brain Dynamics: Statistical Learning and Optimization Summary The human brain is a large, well-connected, and dynamic network. Using functional MRI data, modeling how this network processes the stimulus information has yielded insight on some of the mechanisms of the brain. However, the past efforts, including ours, on using small-scale models yielded limited understanding of how the complete and dynamic neural system functions in task-related experiments. Such understanding cannot be recovered from the data without substantial and collaborative efforts on model development. Towards this goal, we formed a collaborative team from modelers to end-users, and we will develop large-scale methods for task related fMRI (tfMRI), including event-related fMRI, to model whole-brain network dynamics responding to task challenges. Using modern statistical learning principals and large-scale optimization algorithms, we will develop novel methods to model nonlinear, spatial-temporal dependence in high dimensional data of fMRI, stimuli, and behavior outcomes. We will primarily base our methods in the regularized, constrained graphical model (GM) framework, a promising multivariate framework for inferring brain connectivity that has been validated by simulation and anatomical studies. Using this framework, we will develop novel methods to investigate, at a large scale, how changes in connectivity and activation are driven by task challenges and how multiple brain pathways process stimulus information. We will perform comprehensive validation and assessment of the newly developed methods, using both simulated and multiple tfMRI data from large cohorts. Using the scale of modeling that previous approaches cannot readily address without substantial time penalties and maybe also inaccuracies, our collaborative team will also use these methods to investigate various novel questions and hypotheses concerning the neural basis for cognitive control as one of the use cases. We will also develop publicly available, open source implementations for a broad range of use in the neuroimaging community. These modeling efforts will lead to new insights on the networks of large-scale neural circuits, and provide pharmacological targets that may be overlooked using small-scale models.     PUBLIC RELEVANCE STATEMENT We propose a foundational framework for modeling whole-brain network dynamics. Our computational approaches and algorithms will help scientists analyze a wide range of neuroimaging and behavioral data, which will lead to the capability to discover therapeutic and pharmacological targets for treating neurological and psychiatric disorders.",Large-scale Network Modeling for Brain Dynamics: Statistical Learning and Optimization,9170649,R01EB022911,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Space Models', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brain pathway', 'cognitive control', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information model', 'information processing', 'insight', 'large scale simulation', 'model development', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'stimulus processing', 'tool']",NIBIB,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,430066,-0.011965093583359893
"Compressive Light Field microscopy for optogenetic neural activity tracking SUMMARY: Understanding the mechanisms by which the living brain derives perception, cognition and behavior requires the ability to record and control electrical activity in many neurons simultaneously. Completely reconstructing the pattern of neural activity that mediates a specific neural operation is critical for fully understanding its underlying mechanism. This requires an approach that can measure neural activity on a large scale with high spatial and temporal resolution. Functional imaging of genetically encoded activity sensors is one of the most promising avenues towards achieving this goal because it permits dense sampling and unambiguous separation of nearby neurons1, 2. However, even techniques currently available cannot capture neural activity in large volumes of the brain simultaneously, at high speed, and with cellular resolution. Furthermore, these existing approaches rely on expensive and sophisticated hardware, and cannot be readily adapted for imaging in unrestrained animals. Since a central goal of the BRAIN initiative is to achieve large-scale recording of neural activity in behaving animals, a new imaging approach is needed to overcome these technical challenges.  To achieve high speed, volumetric imaging in a compact and inexpensive device, we propose to develop a new imaging modality - compressive four-dimensional (4D) light field microscopy (LFM). In this approach, we will combine the advantages of light field microscopy with compressed sensing to extract the activity of thousands of individual neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution, through scattering tissue. In conventional microscopy, the photo-detector only samples the intensity of photons. In LFM, the sensor also captures the angle of the light. This allows 3D reconstruction, since position and angle enable back-tracing of rays of light. Such a scheme can be achieved simply by placing a lenslet array in the imaging pathway (Fig. 1A). The resulting 4D light field gives complete volumetric data at each time frame3-6. 3D activity can thus be sampled at camera-limited frame rates, much faster than conventional methods such as multiphoton or light sheet microscopy. For these reasons, LFM for functional brain imaging could revolutionize experimental neuroscience.  Unfortunately, imaging methods which operate in the one-photon regime suffer from light scattering. To image activity in the mammalian brain, we must consider the effects of tissue scattering through the 3D volume. We propose to apply a new approach to processing light field data for better reconstructions of neurons through scattering media37,38. Since the effect of scattering is to spread the angles of propagation of light, measuring angle information inherently helps to characterize and mitigate scatter effects. Our method leverages compressed sensing algorithms, which exploit the sparsity of the light emission in 3D space and time. Importantly, the volume and resolution limits of our method are not set by the number of pixels captured, but rather by the number of active neurons at any given time.

"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction.

"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9005185,R01DC014950,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Auricular prosthesis', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ferrets', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory stimulus', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'expectation', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,327250,-0.0008197045907918115
"Neural and Kinematic Features of Freezing of Gait for Adaptive Neurostimulation PROJECT SUMMARY Freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) results in unpredictable episodes of gait cessation, which may lead to falls, injury, a loss of independent living, and even death19. The treatment of FOG is inconsistent with either dopaminergic medication or with current open loop, continuous high frequency deep brain stimulation (cDBS)15, 25. Emerging technology using non-continuous, closed loop or adaptive DBS (aDBS), has the potential to improve treatment for FOG. Adaptive DBS can sense patient specific neural and/or kinematic signals and respond by adjusting DBS parameters to provide more efficacious therapy while reducing adverse side effects known to occur with cDBS. The critical barriers of using aDBS for FOG are the lack of knowledge of: the neural features of FOG that could be ‘sensed’ by aDBS to trigger stimulation, the optimal, patient specific DBS parameters for the treatment of FOG, and whether aDBS for FOG is safe and tolerable in human PD patients. In the Bronte-Stewart Lab, we have the technology, the regulatory approvals and the research experience collecting synchronized neural and quantitative kinematic signals, applying different DBS parameters for FOG, performing the first aDBS experiments in freely moving PD subjects. The Bronte-Stewart Lab was the first group and Stanford was the first site in the United States to implant a sensing neurostimulator for PD, the Activa® PC+S (Medtronic Inc., FDA IDE/Stanford IRB approval, October 2013). This comprised the FDA approved neurostimulator (Activa PC®, Medtronic Inc.) with additional software that enabled recording of brain signals via telemetry from the neurostimulator itself. We have implanted twenty PD patients (largest cohort in the world), from whom we have been collecting synchronized neural and computerized kinematic signals for over thirty months without adverse events. We will use this new technology in conjunction with our expertise in quantitative kinematics and validated measure of FOG to begin understanding the neural features associated with FOG. In addition, we will use quantitative measures of FOG to accurately determine the efficacy of patient specific stimulation parameters for effective and consistent treatment of FOG. No center has had the technological capability to test the safety and feasibility of aDBS for FOG in freely moving PD patients. Whether patients can tolerate aDBS, which continually adjusts output to control a time-varying patient-specific neural signal as they are walking and moving freely is completely unknown and will be assessed in a pilot study in this proposal. This project is expected to signal the beginning of a new era of precise medicine: the possibility to treat FOG in PD in a customized, adaptive manner, while minimizing adverse effects and complementing the treatment of other disabling motor features of PD such as tremor. PROJECT NARRATIVE Freezing of gait (FOG), a severe complication of Parkinson’s disease that could result in falls and even death, is not consistently well treated with current one-size fits all continuous deep brain stimulation therapy. Newly available adaptive DBS (aDBS) provides an opportunity to improve treatment of FOG by delivering precise medicine; real-time patient specific stimulation that is driven by patient specific neural signals. The goals of this project are to perform an in-depth analysis of the synchronized neural and kinematic data of freely moving patients, while stimulating with various settings to (1) better define these poorly understood patient specific signals and effective stimulation settings, and (2) to perform a pilot study to determine the safety and feasibility of whether patients can tolerate aDBS which continually adjusts the stimulation output.",Neural and Kinematic Features of Freezing of Gait for Adaptive Neurostimulation,9244090,R21NS096398,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Bradykinesia', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complication', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dorsal', 'Electrodes', 'Emerging Technologies', 'FDA approved', 'Fall injury', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Independent Living', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Safety', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'cohort', 'comparative efficacy', 'computerized', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'falls', 'human subject', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'new technology', 'patient safety', 'place fields', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'safety testing', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard care']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,235500,0.0279175191701748
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9177620,R01NS095251,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Records Controls', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,891206,0.020963974872952734
"Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understanding how stored memories change as a function of experience. The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weaker—it can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia. In all of these conditions, cogni- tive deficits can arise from insufficient separation of representations. This research may lead to better ways of re-differentiating these representations and—through this—ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits. NARRATIVE This work has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of when learning decreases overlap between memories in the brain (differentiation) or increases overlap (integration). Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dementia, and dyslexia: In all of these conditions, cognitive deficits can arise when there is insufficient neural separation of memories or concepts (e.g., temporal lobe stroke can “collapse” stored visual knowledge, preventing retrieval of names of common objects). The learning models and interventions developed here may eventually lead to new and better ways of re-differentiating these collapsed representa- tions and ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits.","Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning",9263587,R01MH069456,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'behavioral study', 'cost', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'memory retrieval', 'network models', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'phonology', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,521520,-0.006850385124449913
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,9098854,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2016,248999,-0.01002313733680063
"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,9111024,R00HD076166,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neonatology', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'aged', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive development', 'comparison group', 'developmental disease', 'early experience', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'visual stimulus']",NICHD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R00,2016,186761,0.014114407586407052
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,9213710,R00AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R00,2016,249000,-0.003700579319629967
"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis. NARRATIVE  In this project we will develop a filtered point process framework for neural data analysis, with models and algorithms for sparse recovery of spike-trains from time-series data comprising a series of pulsed waveforms. We will use this novel methodology to extract neuronal spike-trains from calcium imaging data of cortical tissue, and to estimate hormone secretion times and amounts from serum hormone levels. We will make our mathematical algorithms for neural data analysis and their software implementation freely and easily available to the neuroscience research community.",Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data,9170395,R01EB022726,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Corticotropin', 'Coupled', 'Cushing Syndrome', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Endocrine system', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Image', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Life', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Noise', 'Osteoporosis', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Somatotropin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'V1 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'area striata', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'dynamic system', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mathematical algorithm', 'movie', 'neural model', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual cognition', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2016,349970,-0.003747541881594489
"Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences.  Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living.  We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern o interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks.  Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 �m diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1).  More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks.  We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks.  The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control.  We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2).  This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom.  We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding.  This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints.  This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For ""Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements:  characterization and translation in neuroprosthetics"" This project will use recordings from the surface of the human brain to study how brain networks control arm and hand movements.

"Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control No abstract available Project Narrative Drug abuse and addiction are severe mental health disorders that affect 23.5 million Americans (9.3%) ages 12 and older in the United States. Much scientific evidence suggests that the maladaptive behaviors seen in drug addiction are linked to disruptions in the neural circuits that underlie reward processing and higher-order cognition, but these basic neural mechanisms of are not well understood.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,8860217,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'neurotransmission', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,228077,0.013830825296425656
"The neural workings of self-initiated and quasi-automatic movements ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncovering the principles behind the generation of voluntary movements is a necessary first step in the development of technologies and treatments aimed at restoring motor abilities lost to neurological disease or trauma. The aim of this project is to shed light on the neural mechanisms of voluntary movement initiation. An essential component of voluntary movement is the choice of when to act. Under normal circumstances this decision can be time consuming usually taking up to a few hundreds of milliseconds, longer that the known delays in the nervous system. The area of the brain most associated with generating movements, the motor cortex, becomes very active just before and during the movement, however what exactly is happening during this time is still not well understood. Indeed, while much is known about the neural basis of generating movements, several open questions remain: does a movement generated deliberately with no time pressure, like a reach made to grab an object from a table, share the same neural underpinnings with a very fast reach to catch a falling object? Will the motor cortex be just as active before a quasi-automatic reach when time is of the essence? Or is pre-movement activity only present when there is enough time to deliberately plan the movement? During movement itself, is motor cortex involved in generating quasi-automatic reaches or is there is some reflex mechanism that bypasses motor cortex to generate urgent reaches? To begin answering these questions we have trained two monkeys to initiate a reach under three very different circumstances: sometimes monkeys move at a time of their own choosing with no imposed time constraints, other times monkeys must intercept a rapidly moving target on a screen, which elicits very short-latency reaches. In yet another set of trials monkeys must withhold a reach until given a go cue. The first aim of this project is to determine if these three movements (self-initiated, quasi-automatic and cue-initiated) share a common neural mechanism that does not depend on how the movement is initiated. To do this we will record the responses from a number of neurons in two key regions of the motor cortex: the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortex. In order to understand and interpret these responses, we will employ cutting edge machine learning techniques that will allow us to visualize and quantify the how neural activity evolves in time. Being able to visualize the evolution of neural activity is a key component in understanding the principles that govern how the neural activity translates to movement. The second aim of this project is to elucidate the role that higher cortical areas play in the generation of voluntar movements. We will record neural activity from areas upstream of motor cortex (supplementary motor area), which is heavily interconnected with the motor cortex and is suspected to play crucial a role in determining when a movement should be initiated. We will test record neural activity from this area and characterize its properties using the same cutting edge techniques developed in the first part of this project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Uncovering the principles behind the generation of voluntary movements is a necessary first step in the development of technologies and treatments aimed at restoring motor abilities lost to neurological disease or trauma.

"Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body. This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.",Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity,8929339,UH3TR000506,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Angioblast', 'Animal Testing', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavioral', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Databases', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug toxicity', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Erinaceidae', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Hydrogels', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Myelogenous', 'Nature', 'Neural Crest', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population', 'RNA Sequences', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Robot', 'Rodent Model', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Washington', 'Yolk Sac', 'base', 'capillary', 'cognitive change', 'cost effective', 'developmental toxicity', 'drug development', 'embryonic stem cell', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'neural plate', 'neurodevelopment', 'notch protein', 'precursor cell', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal exposure', 'progenitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'stem cell biology', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCATS,"MORGRIDGE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, INC.",UH3,2015,613100,-0.006731978537541571
"Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI is a faculty member of the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Stony Brook. His research focuses on spontaneous and evoked neural activity in the gustatory cortex. The candidate recently transitioned to neuroscience from a theoretical physics background. This award will provide the necessary five-year protected period for the candidate to receive training in systems and theoretical neuroscience and electrophysiological techniques, under the supervision of the proposed mentorship committee. By the end of the termed period, the candidate will achieve his long term career goals of successfully applying for independent research funding and becoming an independent investigator in the field of theoretical neuroscience. The goal of the proposed research plan is elucidating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity in the gustatory cortex, and its modulation by anticipatory cues. Spontaneous neural activity in sensory cortices, traditionally regarded as a noisy baseline, is increasingly drawing attention: it can predict trial to trial variability; it contains information on the functional architecture of neural networks; and it was characterized as either a ""repertoire"" of possible network activities or a storage of expectations of sensory stimuli, shaped by development. In the context of taste processing, however, it has received little to no attention. The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the properties of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex. This is an ideal system, due to the rich temporal dynamics of responses to taste stimuli, represented in terms of taste-specific sequences of patterns of activity, synchronized across the whole neural population. The first goal of the proposed plan is to employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to elucidate the features of spontaneous activity in relation to evoked activity. This will provide new analytical tools for the characterization of spontaneous activity and reconcile within a single framework the different views currently held in the literature, by introducing the new feature of temporal dynamics. As a second goal of the proposed project, the role played by anticipatory cues in modulating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity will be elucidated, and the dependence of reaction times on spontaneous activity will be clarified. A biologically plausible model of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex will be introduced, based on networks of spiking neurons. This model will yield a mechanistic understanding of the feature of spontaneous activity as revealed by the analysis of electrophysiological data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is designed to uncover the dynamical features of spontaneous neural activity in the gustatory cortex and to elucidate its role in modulating the processing of taste---related information under different behavioral contexts. The relation between spontaneous and stimulus---evoked activities is the active subject of debate in the neuroscience literature; this project will develop novel analytical and modeling tools aimed at clarifying the extent to which spontaneous and evoked activity are intertwined. The results of this effort will provide a new perspective on the cortical mechanism underlying taste processing in normal conditions, and bears important implications on issues related to public health, such as the role played by attention in food consumption disorders.",Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex,8890825,K25DC013557,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taste Perception', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebrates', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'career', 'design', 'expectation', 'food consumption', 'markov model', 'member', 'millisecond', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'stem', 'taste stimuli', 'tool']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,K25,2015,166288,-0.014349490553926255
"Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Simultaneous wrist/hand control (where a person simultaneously moves his/her wrist while grasping or  releasing), is essential in activities of daiy living, but cannot be performed by amputees using clinical surface  electromyography (sEMG) based neural interfaces (myoelectric control). Transradial amputees, who make up 40% of major amputations (proximal to the wrist), cite simultaneous control as a necessary element to improve upper-limb prostheses. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinically viable EMG-based neural interface for transradial amputees that is suitable for restoring simultaneous control of prosthetic wrist/hand movements.   One proposed method for intuitive simultaneous wrist/hand prosthesis control uses intramuscular EMG  (imEMG) amplitude estimates from multiple agonist/ antagonist forearm muscle pairs to control physiologically  appropriate degrees of freedom DOFs (e.g. flexor digitorum profundus / extensor digitorum control  grasp/release). Known as 'direct control', this approach does not require burdensome levels of machine  learning algorithm training, as is required for experimental sEMG-based simultaneous control methods.  However, this method assumes independently modulated muscle activation patterns for each DOF - that the activation patterns of muscles controlling a DOF (i.e. finger flexors/extensors for grasp/release) do not change when a second DOF is simultaneously attempted (simultaneous pronation/supination and grasp/release). The biologic foundation of such an assumption has not been explored to date. Little is known of how the central nervous system (CNS) coordinates wrist and extrinsic hand muscle activation when independent of biomechanical effects and joint position feedback. Muscle activation patterns under such conditions are particularly relevant to amputee populations, who lack distal joints. Therefore, the objective of this research is to better understand how the CNS coordinates muscle activation patterns in healthy individuals to produce simultaneous wrist/grasp torques when independent of the biomechanical effects of joint movement. We will then apply this information to develop an imEMG simultaneous myoelectric prosthesis controller.  imEMG patterns will be measured as healthy subjects produce single-DOF and simultaneous multi-DOF (SMD) wrist and/or grasp/release torques in isometric, neutral posture conditions. Multivariate models predicting imEMG activity from measured wrist/grasp torques will be developed and will suggest which DOFs have independently modulated muscle activation patterns. This information will then allow for the development of a 'biologically-inspired' simultaneous controller. DOFs with independently modulated muscle activation patterns will be controlled using direct control, while experimental pattern recognition algorithms currently used for sEMG-based simultaneous control will be used for all other DOFs. We will evaluate the performance of this hybrid controller in healthy subjects both offline and using online functional tests in a virtual environment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Various current prosthetic arms use the electrical signals produced when muscles contract to control prosthesis movement, but cannot provide simultaneous control of both the wrist and the hand. This study will investigate how the nervous system activates muscles to simultaneously control the wrist and hand in healthy individuals. This information can then be used to provide clinically viable methods of controlling simultaneous wrist and hand movements of prostheses to amputees.",Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control,8806616,F31NS083166,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Arm', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Educational Status', 'Electromyography', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Flexor', 'Forearm', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Isometric Exercise', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Myoelectric prosthesis', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Pronation', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supination', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Torque', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'extensor digitorum', 'grasp', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'myoelectric control', 'prosthesis control', 'prosthetic hand', 'relating to nervous system', 'residual limb', 'success', 'virtual']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,6800,0.0172438077768006
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.                ",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,8887443,R01NS063399,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2015,339124,0.011827553957879506
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.            ",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,8900645,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Resected', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2015,552097,-0.002722081473028863
"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,8932000,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Contusions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'somatosensory', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2015,1085849,0.03531586663730409
"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.  We will reach critical milestones that will provide the basis for a series of clinical trials for furter defining the efficacy of these interventions.",Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI,8889256,U01EB015521,"['Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Bromocriptine', 'Buspirone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'FDA approved', 'Felis catus', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Oral', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'arm', 'arm function', 'base', 'design', 'human subject', 'improved', 'minimally invasive', 'motor function recovery', 'motor recovery', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'response']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2015,828196,0.02474510726158918
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9047911,R01DC015138,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2015,311320,-0.001964529066902724
"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions. Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects,8893998,R01EY022727,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Stroke', 'Swimming Pools', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'coping', 'data mining', 'distraction', 'flexibility', 'goal oriented behavior', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'sustained attention', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,318059,-0.010068696044064344
"Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant processing of social and affective information is a severe and disabling symptom across many neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent reports demonstrate that direct electrical brain stimulation (EBS) can alter perception, such as changing the identity of a person being viewed or causing memory-related hallucinations. If EBS can distort normal perception, then EBS using different parameters may be able to normalize SAP, for example by modulating affective salience to visual stimuli in PTSD. One key impediment towards developing EBS as a therapy for SAP pathology is that we lack an understanding of how electrical stimulation modulates neurodynamics and cognition. A critical step towards designing rational EBS-based stimulation parameters for SAP pathology is building a causal model of the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics, interregional interactions, and EBS modulation of these dynamics and interactions during SAP. Visual SAP relies on a neural circuit in the temporal lobe that includes the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Non-invasive brain imaging techniques either lack the temporal resolution to examine millisecond dynamics (fMRI/PET), or are relatively insensitive to activity in deep brain structures such as the amygdala (MEG/EEG/TMS). Direct neural recordings using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy will allow us to overcome these barriers to study the dynamics and interactions in the SAP circuit. Furthermore, delivery of EBS via these implanted electrodes will allow us to examine how electrical modulation of this circuit alters SAP. Using iEEG and advanced analysis methods from machine learning, we recently delineated the set of information processing stages that FG goes through for face perception. In this project, we will test a three- stage dynamic model of the sequence of events and interregional interactions that enable SAP based on these previous results, the work of others, and our preliminary data. We will record iEEG in our regions of interest to test neural dynamics during three critical aspects of social affective processing: perception of facial expression (Aim 1), the inference of actions from motion (Aim 2), and guiding conscious perception to affectively and socially salient stimuli (Aim 3). Then we will employ EBS to modulate perception during these processes. In addition, we will supplement iEEG with magnetoencephalography (MEG), which, while less sensitive to amygdala activity, provides whole-brain cortical coverage and facilitates the comparison of iEEG results to a normative population. The outcome of the proposed research will be a spatially and temporally specific model of the causal dynamics and interactions during SAP. This model will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted EBS therapies that may normalize pathological SAP.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Abnormalities in social affective perception are a critical part of the etiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The proposed research will map the detailed neurodynamics of critical aspects of social affective perception and examine how these neurodynamics, and the associated cognitions, can be modulated by brain stimulation. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of social affective perception, a circuit relevant to a number of mental disorders, and take a critical step towards determining how brain stimulation may be used to remediate pathological social affective perception.                ","Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation",8957240,R01MH107797,"['Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Body Image', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Perception', 'Feedback', 'Figs - dietary', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Social Perception', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'encephalography', 'evidence base', 'face perception', 'healthy volunteer', 'information gathering', 'information processing', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,502152,-0.022470223970589134
"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.            ",ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA,8961749,R01MH064537,"['Accounting', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Part', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Grant', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'frontier', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'parallel processing', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'trend']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,378758,0.009592300535684021
"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8807937,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2015,341436,0.009359556884745653
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8898252,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2015,249000,-0.01002313733680063
"Fully Implantable and Programmable Spike-based Codecs for Neuroprosthetics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Often the disability is so severe that it is not possible to feed oneself or readily communicate. A new class of medical system termed brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has emerged from research labs in the past decade and is now poised to dramatically improve these patients' quality of life. BMIs ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decode these electrical impulses in order to determine the intended movement. Initial versions of BMI systems that control a computer cursor are now in FDA Phase-I clinical trials, and numerous agencies are actively engaged in clinical translation (e.g., NIH, DARPA, VA). Creating control signals to enable an amputee to feed himself with a prosthetic (robotic) arm and hand will require decoding signals from thousands of electrodes, rather than the hundred or so signals current systems read, as well as encoding thousands of sensor signals from the arm and hand into thousands of artificial neural signals to be ""written into"" the brain, which has not yet been attempted. The lack of low-power (so that it can be implanted) electronic circuitry needed to run BMIs' encoding and decoding algorithms (termed codecs) is a fundamental barrier to successful clinical translation. The technologies available until now are too power-hungry (digital) or too algorithmically inflexible (analog) to meet the challenge. Recent advances in neuromorphic engineering make it now possible to build a fully implantable and programmable codec chip. This innovative approach combines digital's and analog's best features-programmability and efficiency-while offering far greater robustness than either. Meanwhile recent advances in neuroscience techniques make it now possible to obtain the knowledge needed to design the right algorithms to run on our codec chip. Optogenetic stimulaton can now be used to drive neurons in macaque cortex and computer vision can now be used to track freely moving monkeys while recording wirelessly. We propose to leverage these recent advances to dramatically increase prosthetic performance through the principled design of: (1) An entirely new class of encoders that can spatio-temporally pattern neural activity via optogenetic techniques. (2) An entirely new class of decoders that can operate in the real world with animals moving freely around in far less constrained settings. (3) An entirely new class of implantable programmable electronics that achieves the level of energy- efficiency required to run these complex algorithms. We will demonstrate our success by having a freely moving primate, with a 96-microelectrode recording array and a 9-channel optogenetic stimulator implanted in its premotor and somatosensory cortex, respectively, control a human-like robotic arm. Our ultimate goal is to realize the neuromorphic engineer's dream: Helping untold millions with neurological injury by replacing damaged neural tissue with chips that work like the brain. Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment.

"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,8849468,K99HD076166,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neonatology', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'aged', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive development', 'comparison group', 'developmental disease', 'early experience', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'visual stimulus']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K99,2015,82417,0.014114407586407052

If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,9085979,R00HD076166,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neonatology', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'aged', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive development', 'comparison group', 'developmental disease', 'early experience', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'visual stimulus']",NICHD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R00,2015,249000,0.014114407586407052
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,8775624,K99AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2015,90000,-0.003700579319629967
"Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences.  Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living.  We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern o interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks.  Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 �m diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1).  More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks.  We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks.  The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control.  We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2).  This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom.  We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding.  This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints.  This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For ""Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements:  characterization and translation in neuroprosthetics"" This project will use recordings from the surface of the human brain to study how brain networks control arm and hand movements.  We will also test whether information about these networks can be used to control an advanced robotic prosthetic arm.

"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.          This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,8692440,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,227375,0.013830825296425656
"Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body. This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.",Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity,8768889,UH3TR000506,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Angioblast', 'Animal Testing', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavioral', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Databases', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug toxicity', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Erinaceidae', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Hydrogels', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Myelogenous', 'Nature', 'Neural Crest', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population', 'RNA Sequences', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Robot', 'Rodent Model', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Washington', 'Yolk Sac', 'base', 'capillary', 'cognitive change', 'cost effective', 'drug development', 'embryonic stem cell', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'neural plate', 'neurodevelopment', 'notch protein', 'precursor cell', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal exposure', 'progenitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'stem cell biology', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCATS,"MORGRIDGE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, INC.",UH3,2014,596891,-0.006731978537541571
"Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI is a faculty member of the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Stony Brook. His research focuses on spontaneous and evoked neural activity in the gustatory cortex. The candidate recently transitioned to neuroscience from a theoretical physics background. This award will provide the necessary five-year protected period for the candidate to receive training in systems and theoretical neuroscience and electrophysiological techniques, under the supervision of the proposed mentorship committee. By the end of the termed period, the candidate will achieve his long term career goals of successfully applying for independent research funding and becoming an independent investigator in the field of theoretical neuroscience. The goal of the proposed research plan is elucidating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity in the gustatory cortex, and its modulation by anticipatory cues. Spontaneous neural activity in sensory cortices, traditionally regarded as a noisy baseline, is increasingly drawing attention: it can predict trial to trial variability; it contains information on the functional architecture of neural networks; and it was characterized as either a ""repertoire"" of possible network activities or a storage of expectations of sensory stimuli, shaped by development. In the context of taste processing, however, it has received little to no attention. The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the properties of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex. This is an ideal system, due to the rich temporal dynamics of responses to taste stimuli, represented in terms of taste-specific sequences of patterns of activity, synchronized across the whole neural population. The first goal of the proposed plan is to employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to elucidate the features of spontaneous activity in relation to evoked activity. This will provide new analytical tools for the characterization of spontaneous activity and reconcile within a single framework the different views currently held in the literature, by introducing the new feature of temporal dynamics. As a second goal of the proposed project, the role played by anticipatory cues in modulating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity will be elucidated, and the dependence of reaction times on spontaneous activity will be clarified. A biologically plausible model of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex will be introduced, based on networks of spiking neurons. This model will yield a mechanistic understanding of the feature of spontaneous activity as revealed by the analysis of electrophysiological data.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is designed to uncover the dynamical features of spontaneous neural activity in the gustatory cortex and to elucidate its role in modulating the processing of taste---related information under different behavioral contexts. The relation between spontaneous and stimulus---evoked activities is the active subject of debate in the neuroscience literature; this project will develop novel analytical and modeling tools aimed at clarifying the extent to which spontaneous and evoked activity are intertwined. The results of this effort will provide a new perspective on the cortical mechanism underlying taste processing in normal conditions, and bears important implications on issues related to public health, such as the role played by attention in food consumption disorders.                ",Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex,8766158,K25DC013557,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taste Perception', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebrates', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'career', 'design', 'expectation', 'food consumption', 'markov model', 'member', 'millisecond', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'stem', 'tool']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,K25,2014,167410,-0.014349490553926255
"The Neural Bases of he Semantic Structure of Words and Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to discover the neural representation of some simple words and concepts. It uses newly developed machine learning techniques and dimension reduction methods applied to fMRI brain activation data that will be acquired in new experimental paradigms. This research approach has for the first time succeeded in identifying the content of individual human thoughts based on the pattern of brain activity. The initial published studies have demonstrated this capability in the case of concrete nouns and physical objects. This project proposes to expand the approach to a much larger set of different types of concepts and to examine the effect of the way the concept is presented (e.g. a written or spoken word, or a picture). The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of how neural representations of meaning arise from the various brain systems that are used in interacting or considering the concept. An important secondary goal is to determine the degree of commonality of the neural representations across people.  The studies propose to examine the neural dimensions of meaning in three domains: (a) physical objects; (b) human traits, emotions, and interpersonal interactions; and (c) small numerical quantities. This set of semantic domains is expected to provide sufficient breadth to reveal some of the principle neural bases of semantic representation.  In contrast to the field of ""semantics"" (the study of the relation between words and their meanings), this project will help establish a new research area, neurosemantics, which is the study of the relation between words, thoughts, and their neural representations. The key assumption is that the underlying dimensions of meaning representation in the human brain are derived from basic neural systems. For example, one of the dimensions of representation of a physical object is how one physically interacts with or handles it. This dimension of representation is underpinned by a network of cortical areas that co-activate when one thinks about a physical object, and also when one actually handles the physical object. Other dimensions of neural representation similarly emerge when the concept is encountered. The studies will collectively identify the major dimensions of concept representation and relate them to networks of co-activating brain areas.  The cumulative knowledge from the completed project will provide the framework of a theory of how brain systems map onto the representation of the meaning of concepts. The theory will be applicable to understanding and designing therapies for neurological conditions in which the meanings of concepts are distorted, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and autism. The resulting theory will be foundational in relating the representation of meaning to brain function.        The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy. More generally, as a recent review (Bray et al., 2009) indicates, the new approach provides a good match to the brain characteristics of several brain disorders, and it is beginning to be applied for health-related purposes in many domains.

"Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Simultaneous wrist/hand control (where a person simultaneously moves his/her wrist while grasping or  releasing), is essential in activities of daiy living, but cannot be performed by amputees using clinical surface  electromyography (sEMG) based neural interfaces (myoelectric control). Transradial amputees, who make up 40% of major amputations (proximal to the wrist), cite simultaneous control as a necessary element to improve upper-limb prostheses. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinically viable EMG-based neural interface for transradial amputees that is suitable for restoring simultaneous control of prosthetic wrist/hand movements.   One proposed method for intuitive simultaneous wrist/hand prosthesis control uses intramuscular EMG  (imEMG) amplitude estimates from multiple agonist/ antagonist forearm muscle pairs to control physiologically  appropriate degrees of freedom DOFs (e.g. flexor digitorum profundus / extensor digitorum control  grasp/release). Known as 'direct control', this approach does not require burdensome levels of machine  learning algorithm training, as is required for experimental sEMG-based simultaneous control methods.  However, this method assumes independently modulated muscle activation patterns for each DOF - that the activation patterns of muscles controlling a DOF (i.e. finger flexors/extensors for grasp/release) do not change when a second DOF is simultaneously attempted (simultaneous pronation/supination and grasp/release). The biologic foundation of such an assumption has not been explored to date. Little is known of how the central nervous system (CNS) coordinates wrist and extrinsic hand muscle activation when independent of biomechanical effects and joint position feedback. Muscle activation patterns under such conditions are particularly relevant to amputee populations, who lack distal joints. Therefore, the objective of this research is to better understand how the CNS coordinates muscle activation patterns in healthy individuals to produce simultaneous wrist/grasp torques when independent of the biomechanical effects of joint movement. We will then apply this information to develop an imEMG simultaneous myoelectric prosthesis controller.  imEMG patterns will be measured as healthy subjects produce single-DOF and simultaneous multi-DOF (SMD) wrist and/or grasp/release torques in isometric, neutral posture conditions. Multivariate models predicting imEMG activity from measured wrist/grasp torques will be developed and will suggest which DOFs have independently modulated muscle activation patterns. This information will then allow for the development of a 'biologically-inspired' simultaneous controller. DOFs with independently modulated muscle activation patterns will be controlled using direct control, while experimental pattern recognition algorithms currently used for sEMG-based simultaneous control will be used for all other DOFs. We will evaluate the performance of this hybrid controller in healthy subjects both offline and using online functional tests in a virtual environment.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Various current prosthetic arms use the electrical signals produced when muscles contract to control prosthesis movement, but cannot provide simultaneous control of both the wrist and the hand. This study will investigate how the nervous system activates muscles to simultaneously control the wrist and hand in healthy individuals. This information can then be used to provide clinically viable methods of controlling simultaneous wrist and hand movements of prostheses to amputees.                 ",Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control,8702940,F31NS083166,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Educational Status', 'Electromyography', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Flexor', 'Forearm', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Isometric Exercise', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Myoelectric prosthesis', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Pronation', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supination', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Torque', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'extensor digitorum', 'grasp', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'virtual']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2014,47676,0.0172438077768006
"A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Of the approximately 10 million people in the US living with paralysis, 15,000 are the result of spinal cord injury each year. The first year of care can range from $322,000-$986,000, with lifetime costs of $1.4-4M for someone injured at 25 years of age. In addition to potentially devastating sensorimotor disturbances, there is a huge financial cost, estimated to be $13.55B in medical care, therapy, and lost productivity nationwide. Until very recently, the recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) was bleak, with little hope of restoring motor function. To address this we have demonstrated that the physiological state of the spinal circuitry of rats and cats can be modulated with epidural stimulation to generate voluntary limb motor function over a range of speeds, loads, and directions, a finding we have extended to humans. Three years post-injury, a motor complete spinal cord injured human subject was implanted with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord. In less than one month after implantation, the subject could stand independently, and after 7 months of daily epidural stimulation and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of epidural stimulation, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of epidural stimulation. We will advance these discoveries with the use of non-invasive stimulation of the lumbosacral cord to improve lower limb function following SCI. Central to this proposal is our discovery of a painless electrical multi-channel (stimulation of multiple parts of the spinal cord) theranostic tool that can be applied to the surface of the skin, termed transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation (TESCS), bypassing the need for a surgically-implanted electrode array. In the first phase of this proposal we will demonstrate proof-of-principle that stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord can assess spared spinal motor function by: 1) Testing responses to transcutaneous electrical stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury; and 2) defining the operational parameters of electrical stimulation that that are most effective using a machine-learning protocol, and 3) produce a multi-channel commercial prototype. This commercial product will undergo testing similar to the proof-of- principle device. This device will then be tested in subjects with cervicothoracic spinal cord injury and evaluated with a machine-learning protocol. This Phase I proposal will deliver a device that can painlessly and non-invasively aid in the assessment and recovery of SCI by delivering a specific electrical stimulation paradigm to the lumbosacral cord that improves use of the lower limbs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. PROJECT NARRATIVE It now seems possible to apply three interventions: transcutaneous stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training, to assess and enable the excitability of spared neural circuits in humans with a thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their legs. This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postura and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI in which epidural stimulation was used. We will build and demonstrate a multi-channel transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation theranostic tool that we propose will allow assessment and enabling of lower limb function following a cervicothoracic spinal cord injury.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.  This project examines whether signals recorded directly from the human brain (during surgery for epilepsy) could be used to control a robotic hand.

"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We now have demonstrated that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can be neuromodulated with epidural stimulation to enable recovery of standing and volitional control of the lower limbs and return of some autonomic function after complete motor paralysis.  Therefore, our objectives are now to develop the technologies needed to more fully capitalize on this clinical potential and develop home-use technologies to do so.                  ",Spinal Epidural Electrode Array To Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI,8696689,U01EB007615,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bladder Control', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Contusions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrodes', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Frequencies', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intramuscular', 'Learning', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Sensory', 'Sex Functioning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord transection injury', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Training', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'motor function recovery', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'somatosensory', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2014,1152001,0.03531586663730409
"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.  We will reach critical milestones that will provide the basis for a series of clinical trials for furter defining the efficacy of these interventions.                ",Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI,8690845,U01EB015521,"['Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Bromocriptine', 'Buspirone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'FDA approved', 'Felis catus', 'Food', 'Forelimb', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Oral', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Testing', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'human subject', 'improved', 'minimally invasive', 'motor function recovery', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'public health relevance', 'response']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2014,819964,0.02474510726158918
"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.          Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

"CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intellectual Merit: There is compelling evidence that the distinct stages of sleep play an essential role in the long-term consolidation of memories (Marshall & Born 2007). Specifically, slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is hallmarked by slow oscillatory activity (< 1 Hz) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG), has been implicated in memory consolidation. We demonstrated that weak electric currents (<1mA, <1Hz and DC) applied to the scalp during SWS modulate these endogenous EEG rhythms and can improve human memory performance (Marshall 2006a). Moreover, application of the same weak currents during learning modulates ongoing EEG rhythms that are typical for the awake state in humans and boosts immediate performance in some learning tasks (Kirov 2009). Yet, despite these remarkable phenomenological findings, the question of how weak currents can modulate brain oscillations and induce plastic changes in brain function remains fundamentally unaddressed. Here we propose to quantitatively address this question through the development of computational models that are tightly constrained by specialized brain-slice experiments and validated through targeted human subject experiments. A central question is: how can weak electric currents, that appear insufficient to modulate excitability or plasticity in quiescent neurons, exert such a powerful effect on oscillations and learning? Our central hypothesis is that weak currents couple into ongoing slow oscillatory activity that then boost their modulatory effect on synaptic plasticity. Preliminary data from our group and others already provides strong evidence for modulation of endogenous rhythmic network activity by applied currents - at intensities considered too weak to affect single neuron function. Concurrently, we and other groups have investigated links between slow wave activity and memory consolidation, including by application of weak currents in human. But a specific connection between the effects of applied weak currents on slow-wave rhythms and plasticity has so far not been explored. Guided by computational models, the crucial empirical link between the two will be sought by probing lasting changes resulting from weak-current stimulation of an in vitro cortical preparation that exhibits SWA. Targeted human experiments will directly test if applied currents also enhance the consolidation of other SWS-mediated learning as the hypothesis would suggest, or rather, if the effect is limited to hippocampus-related learning, thus providing significant constraints to the computational models.    Broader Impacts: Weak applied currents are being explored in a number of empirical studies for their potential benefits to treat depression and neuropathic pain, to assist motor learning after stroke, or more generally, to enhance cognitive performance and to improve learning. The promise of this technique is that weak currents can be applied non-invasively with a potentially broad range of applications and minimal side effects. The enigma in this potentially transformative clinical tool, however, is that the electric field strengths generated by these currents in most studies are two orders of magnitude below what is required to activate an otherwise silent neuron. Currently, research in this area is almost entirely phenomenological and the few mechanistic explanations for the promising phenomenological observations are superficial (e.g. describing all brain function as a ""sliding scale of excitability"") and do not address plasticity - as such, there is no rational basis for improving and targeting stimulation protocols. This work is the first attempt at establishing the mechanistic link between applied currents on endogenous rhythms and the associated SWS-related learning enhancements. Evidently, such an analysis will address basic science questions about the link between endogenous SWS and learning, add to the set of experimental tools which can be used to study cognition, and, shed light on the functional and causal role of the ubiquitous endogenous rhythms generated by the brain.    Consistent with present call for US/German Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience this project will combined the expertise of international researchers in the areas of: (1) effects of noninvasive electrical stimulation on nervous tissue (Bikson, US), EEG signal analysis and computational network models (Parra, US), human sleep and learning with applied currents (Marshall, Germany), and dynamical systems and machine learning (Claussen/Martinetz, Germany; Parra, US).           n/a",CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep,8662794,R01MH092926,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Chemosensitization', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Models', 'Frequencies', 'German population', 'Germany', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'International', 'Ion Channel', 'Kale - dietary', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'density', 'electric field', 'human subject', 'imprint', 'improved', 'memory trace reactivation', 'motor learning', 'neocortical', 'painful neuropathy', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIMH,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2014,124361,-0.004998864613560955
"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.            ",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8624688,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2014,344886,0.009359556884745653
"Quantitative Analysis of PEM for REMBD Identification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder (RBD) refers to a condition in which patients act out their dreams and engage in potentially disruptive, injurious and even dangerous behavior while asleep[1-3]. Clinical reports of RBD have been shown to anticipate the development of neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's Disease by 20 years or more [4-6]. Despite this potential prognostic significance for human disease, the field of Sleep Medicine lacks an accepted computerized approach to quantify muscle activity in sleep. This proposed interdisciplinary research seeks to merge methods of computer engineering based computation with advanced neuroscience to establish a computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) to detect RBD via measurement and analysis of the phasic electromyographic activity metric (PEM). The sponsor (Bliwise) has provided evidence based on traditional visual analyses from ""expert"" scorers that PEM recorded during sleep is a sensitive indicator a) to differentiate PD patients from controls [7]; b) to distinguish non-PD patients with a history of RBD from controls [8]; and c) to differentiate PD patients with early and late stage disease [9]. These data suggest that computer-aided PEM detection within a user-friendly CDSS will be vital for clinicians to determine prognosis, track disease course, and, possibly, even monitor treatment.           The proposed work is envisioned as a vital and integral component to establish standardized computerized bio-signal processing methods to detect phasic muscle activity in overnight human sleep polysomnograms for the identification and treatment of Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder.

"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8892350,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2014,249000,-0.01002313733680063
"Fully Implantable and Programmable Spike-based Codecs for Neuroprosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Often the disability is so severe that it is not possible to feed oneself or readily communicate. A new class of medical system termed brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has emerged from research labs in the past decade and is now poised to dramatically improve these patients' quality of life. BMIs ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decode these electrical impulses in order to determine the intended movement. Initial versions of BMI systems that control a computer cursor are now in FDA Phase-I clinical trials, and numerous agencies are actively engaged in clinical translation (e.g., NIH, DARPA, VA). Creating control signals to enable an amputee to feed himself with a prosthetic (robotic) arm and hand will require decoding signals from thousands of electrodes, rather than the hundred or so signals current systems read, as well as encoding thousands of sensor signals from the arm and hand into thousands of artificial neural signals to be ""written into"" the brain, which has not yet been attempted. The lack of low-power (so that it can be implanted) electronic circuitry needed to run BMIs' encoding and decoding algorithms (termed codecs) is a fundamental barrier to successful clinical translation. The technologies available until now are too power-hungry (digital) or too algorithmically inflexible (analog) to meet the challenge. Recent advances in neuromorphic engineering make it now possible to build a fully implantable and programmable codec chip. This innovative approach combines digital's and analog's best features-programmability and efficiency-while offering far greater robustness than either. Meanwhile recent advances in neuroscience techniques make it now possible to obtain the knowledge needed to design the right algorithms to run on our codec chip. Optogenetic stimulaton can now be used to drive neurons in macaque cortex and computer vision can now be used to track freely moving monkeys while recording wirelessly. We propose to leverage these recent advances to dramatically increase prosthetic performance through the principled design of: (1) An entirely new class of encoders that can spatio-temporally pattern neural activity via optogenetic techniques. (2) An entirely new class of decoders that can operate in the real world with animals moving freely around in far less constrained settings. (3) An entirely new class of implantable programmable electronics that achieves the level of energy- efficiency required to run these complex algorithms. We will demonstrate our success by having a freely moving primate, with a 96-microelectrode recording array and a 9-channel optogenetic stimulator implanted in its premotor and somatosensory cortex, respectively, control a human-like robotic arm. Our ultimate goal is to realize the neuromorphic engineer's dream: Helping untold millions with neurological injury by replacing damaged neural tissue with chips that work like the brain.

"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.                ",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,8634272,K99HD076166,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neonatology', 'Neural Pathways', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'aged', 'awake', 'base', 'comparison group', 'developmental disease', 'early experience', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'visual stimulus']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K99,2014,82417,0.014114407586407052
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through  multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to artificial intelligence and neural prosthetics; smarter cochlear implants can be built, as well as devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves.

"Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences. Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living. We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern o interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks. Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 μm diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1). More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks. We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks. The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control. We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2). This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom. We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding. This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints. This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: For ""Multi-scale network dynamics of human upper limb movements: characterization and translation in neuroprosthetics"" This project will use recordings from the surface of the human brain to study how brain networks control arm and hand movements. We will also test whether information about these networks can be used to control an advanced robotic prosthetic arm.

"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.          This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,8532012,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,227049,0.013830825296425656
"CRCNS: Hybrid non-invasive brain-machine interfaces for 3D object manipulation Interacting with the physical environment and manipulating objects is an essential part of daily life. This ability is lost in upper-limb amputees as well as patients with spinal cord injury, stroke, ALS and other movement disorders. These people know what they want to do as well as how they would do it if their arms were functional. If such knowledge is decoded and sent to a prosthetic arm (or to the patient's own arm fitted with functional electric stimulators) the lost motor function could be restored. The decoding is unlikely to be perfect however the brain can adapt to an imperfect decoder using real-time feedback. Several groups including ours have recently demonstrated that at least in principle this can be achieved. However, as is often the case in science, the initial work has been done in idealized conditions and its applicability to real-world usage scenarios remains an open question. The goal of this project is to bring movement control brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) closer to helping the people who need them, and at the same time exploit the rich datasets we collect in order to advance our understanding of sensorimotor control and learning. This will be accomplished by creating hybrid BMIs which exploit information from multiple sources, combined with modern algorithms from machine learning and automatic control. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Being able to interact with the physical environment and manipulate objects is an essential part of daily life.

"Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body.

"The Neural Bases of he Semantic Structure of Words and Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to discover the neural representation of some simple words and concepts. It uses newly developed machine learning techniques and dimension reduction methods applied to fMRI brain activation data that will be acquired in new experimental paradigms. This research approach has for the first time succeeded in identifying the content of individual human thoughts based on the pattern of brain activity. The initial published studies have demonstrated this capability in the case of concrete nouns and physical objects. This project proposes to expand the approach to a much larger set of different types of concepts and to examine the effect of the way the concept is presented (e.g. a written or spoken word, or a picture). The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of how neural representations of meaning arise from the various brain systems that are used in interacting or considering the concept. An important secondary goal is to determine the degree of commonality of the neural representations across people.  The studies propose to examine the neural dimensions of meaning in three domains: (a) physical objects; (b) human traits, emotions, and interpersonal interactions; and (c) small numerical quantities. This set of semantic domains is expected to provide sufficient breadth to reveal some of the principle neural bases of semantic representation.  In contrast to the field of ""semantics"" (the study of the relation between words and their meanings), this project will help establish a new research area, neurosemantics, which is the study of the relation between words, thoughts, and their neural representations. The key assumption is that the underlying dimensions of meaning representation in the human brain are derived from basic neural systems. For example, one of the dimensions of representation of a physical object is how one physically interacts with or handles it. This dimension of representation is underpinned by a network of cortical areas that co-activate when one thinks about a physical object, and also when one actually handles the physical object. Other dimensions of neural representation similarly emerge when the concept is encountered. The studies will collectively identify the major dimensions of concept representation and relate them to networks of co-activating brain areas.  The cumulative knowledge from the completed project will provide the framework of a theory of how brain systems map onto the representation of the meaning of concepts. The theory will be applicable to understanding and designing therapies for neurological conditions in which the meanings of concepts are distorted, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and autism. The resulting theory will be foundational in relating the representation of meaning to brain function.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy. More generally, as a recent review (Bray et al., 2009) indicates, the new approach provides a good match to the brain characteristics of several brain disorders, and it is beginning to be applied for health-related purposes in many domains.

"Restoring arm and hand motor function with non-invasive spinal stimulation.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Of the approximately 10 million people in the US living with paralysis, 15,000 are the result of spinal cord injury each year. The first year of car can range from $322,000-$986,000, with lifetime costs of $1.4-4M for someone injured at 25 years of age. In addition to potentially devastating sensorimotor disturbances, there is a huge financial cost, estimated to be $13.55B in medical care, therapy, and lost productivity nationwide. Until very recently, the recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) was bleak, with little hope of restoring motor function. To address this we have demonstrated that the physiological state of the spinal circuitry of rats and cats can be modulated with epidural stimulation to generate voluntary limb motor function over a range of speeds, loads, and directions, a finding we have extended to humans. Three years post-injury, a motor complete spinal cord injured human subject was implanted with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord. In less than one month after implantation, the subject could stand independently, and after 7 months of daily epidural stimulation and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of epidural stimulation, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of epidural stimulation. We will advance these discoveries with the use of non-invasive stimulation of the cervical cord to improve arm and hand function following SCI. Central to this proposal is our discovery of a painless electrical single-channel (stimulation of one part of the spinal cord) and dual-channel (stimulation of two different parts of the cord) paradigm that can be applied to the surface of the skin, termed transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES), bypassing the need for a surgically-implanted electrode array. In the first phase of this proposal we will demonstrate proof-of-principle that stimulation of the cervical spinal cord can improve motor function by: 1) Testing responses to transcutaneous electrical stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury; and 2) defining the operational parameters of electrical stimulation that that are most effective using a machine-learning protocol, and 3) produce a dual-channel commercial prototype. This commercial product will undergo testing similar to the proof- of-principle device. This device will then be tested in subjects with cervical spinal cord injury and evaluated with a machine-learning protocol. This Phase I proposal will deliver a device that can painlessly and non-invasively aid in the recovery of SCI by delivering a specific electrical stimulation paradigm to the cervical cord that improves use of the arms and hands.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Electrical modulation of the spinal cord can restore voluntary motor function in patients with spinal cord injury, a phenomenon we have demonstrated with both implantable electric devices and devices that provide electrical stimulation to the cord through the surface of the skin.

"Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Simultaneous wrist/hand control (where a person simultaneously moves his/her wrist while grasping or  releasing), is essential in activities of daiy living, but cannot be performed by amputees using clinical surface  electromyography (sEMG) based neural interfaces (myoelectric control). Transradial amputees, who make up 40% of major amputations (proximal to the wrist), cite simultaneous control as a necessary element to improve upper-limb prostheses. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinically viable EMG-based neural interface for transradial amputees that is suitable for restoring simultaneous control of prosthetic wrist/hand movements.   One proposed method for intuitive simultaneous wrist/hand prosthesis control uses intramuscular EMG  (imEMG) amplitude estimates from multiple agonist/ antagonist forearm muscle pairs to control physiologically  appropriate degrees of freedom DOFs (e.g. flexor digitorum profundus / extensor digitorum control  grasp/release). Known as 'direct control', this approach does not require burdensome levels of machine  learning algorithm training, as is required for experimental sEMG-based simultaneous control methods.  However, this method assumes independently modulated muscle activation patterns for each DOF - that the activation patterns of muscles controlling a DOF (i.e. finger flexors/extensors for grasp/release) do not change when a second DOF is simultaneously attempted (simultaneous pronation/supination and grasp/release). The biologic foundation of such an assumption has not been explored to date. Little is known of how the central nervous system (CNS) coordinates wrist and extrinsic hand muscle activation when independent of biomechanical effects and joint position feedback. Muscle activation patterns under such conditions are particularly relevant to amputee populations, who lack distal joints. Therefore, the objective of this research is to better understand how the CNS coordinates muscle activation patterns in healthy individuals to produce simultaneous wrist/grasp torques when independent of the biomechanical effects of joint movement. We will then apply this information to develop an imEMG simultaneous myoelectric prosthesis controller.  imEMG patterns will be measured as healthy subjects produce single-DOF and simultaneous multi-DOF (SMD) wrist and/or grasp/release torques in isometric, neutral posture conditions. Multivariate models predicting imEMG activity from measured wrist/grasp torques will be developed and will suggest which DOFs have independently modulated muscle activation patterns. This information will then allow for the development of a 'biologically-inspired' simultaneous controller. DOFs with independently modulated muscle activation patterns will be controlled using direct control, while experimental pattern recognition algorithms currently used for sEMG-based simultaneous control will be used for all other DOFs. We will evaluate the performance of this hybrid controller in healthy subjects both offline and using online functional tests in a virtual environment.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Various current prosthetic arms use the electrical signals produced when muscles contract to control prosthesis movement, but cannot provide simultaneous control of both the wrist and the hand. This study will investigate how the nervous system activates muscles to simultaneously control the wrist and hand in healthy individuals. This information can then be used to provide clinically viable methods of controlling simultaneous wrist and hand movements of prostheses to amputees.                 ",Wrist/Grasp Muscle Activity Patterns for EMG-neural Interface Prosthesis Control,8526724,F31NS083166,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Educational Status', 'Electromyography', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Flexor', 'Forearm', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Isometric Exercise', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Myoelectric prosthesis', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Pronation', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supination', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Torque', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'extensor digitorum', 'grasp', 'improved', 'joint mobilization', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'virtual']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2013,47232,0.0172438077768006

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.

"Enabling forelimb function with agonist drug and epidural stimulation in SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to apply three interventions (epidural stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training) to control the excitability of localized neural circuits in humans with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their arms and hands.  This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postural and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.          Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

"CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intellectual Merit: There is compelling evidence that the distinct stages of sleep play an essential role in the long-term consolidation of memories (Marshall & Born 2007). Specifically, slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is hallmarked by slow oscillatory activity (< 1 Hz) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG), has been implicated in memory consolidation. We demonstrated that weak electric currents (<1mA, <1Hz and DC) applied to the scalp during SWS modulate these endogenous EEG rhythms and can improve human memory performance (Marshall 2006a). Moreover, application of the same weak currents during learning modulates ongoing EEG rhythms that are typical for the awake state in humans and boosts immediate performance in some learning tasks (Kirov 2009). Yet, despite these remarkable phenomenological findings, the question of how weak currents can modulate brain oscillations and induce plastic changes in brain function remains fundamentally unaddressed. Here we propose to quantitatively address this question through the development of computational models that are tightly constrained by specialized brain-slice experiments and validated through targeted human subject experiments. A central question is: how can weak electric currents, that appear insufficient to modulate excitability or plasticity in quiescent neurons, exert such a powerful effect on oscillations and learning? Our central hypothesis is that weak currents couple into ongoing slow oscillatory activity that then boost their modulatory effect on synaptic plasticity. Preliminary data from our group and others already provides strong evidence for modulation of endogenous rhythmic network activity by applied currents - at intensities considered too weak to affect single neuron function. Concurrently, we and other groups have investigated links between slow wave activity and memory consolidation, including by application of weak currents in human. But a specific connection between the effects of applied weak currents on slow-wave rhythms and plasticity has so far not been explored. Guided by computational models, the crucial empirical link between the two will be sought by probing lasting changes resulting from weak-current stimulation of an in vitro cortical preparation that exhibits SWA. Targeted human experiments will directly test if applied currents also enhance the consolidation of other SWS-mediated learning as the hypothesis would suggest, or rather, if the effect is limited to hippocampus-related learning, thus providing significant constraints to the computational models.    Broader Impacts: Weak applied currents are being explored in a number of empirical studies for their potential benefits to treat depression and neuropathic pain, to assist motor learning after stroke, or more generally, to enhance cognitive performance and to improve learning. The promise of this technique is that weak currents can be applied non-invasively with a potentially broad range of applications and minimal side effects. The enigma in this potentially transformative clinical tool, however, is that the electric field strengths generated by these currents in most studies are two orders of magnitude below what is required to activate an otherwise silent neuron. Currently, research in this area is almost entirely phenomenological and the few mechanistic explanations for the promising phenomenological observations are superficial (e.g. describing all brain function as a ""sliding scale of excitability"") and do not address plasticity - as such, there is no rational basis for improving and targeting stimulation protocols. This work is the first attempt at establishing the mechanistic link between applied currents on endogenous rhythms and the associated SWS-related learning enhancements. Evidently, such an analysis will address basic science questions about the link between endogenous SWS and learning, add to the set of experimental tools which can be used to study cognition, and, shed light on the functional and causal role of the ubiquitous endogenous rhythms generated by the brain.    Consistent with present call for US/German Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience this project will combined the expertise of international researchers in the areas of: (1) effects of noninvasive electrical stimulation on nervous tissue (Bikson, US), EEG signal analysis and computational network models (Parra, US), human sleep and learning with applied currents (Marshall, Germany), and dynamical systems and machine learning (Claussen/Martinetz, Germany; Parra, US).           n/a",CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep,8517819,R01MH092926,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Chemosensitization', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Models', 'Frequencies', 'German population', 'Germany', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'International', 'Ion Channel', 'Kale - dietary', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'density', 'electric field', 'human subject', 'imprint', 'improved', 'memory trace reactivation', 'motor learning', 'neocortical', 'painful neuropathy', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIMH,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2013,119387,-0.004998864613560955
"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories. These waves exhibit spatial patterns that may help guide the proper function of the hippocampus. This work could potentially explain how distortions in electrical activity relate to defects in people's abilities to form and recall memories.

"Quantitative Analysis of PEM for REMBD Identification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder (RBD) refers to a condition in which patients act out their dreams and engage in potentially disruptive, injurious and even dangerous behavior while asleep[1-3]. Clinical reports of RBD have been shown to anticipate the development of neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's Disease by 20 years or more [4-6]. Despite this potential prognostic significance for human disease, the field of Sleep Medicine lacks an accepted computerized approach to quantify muscle activity in sleep. This proposed interdisciplinary research seeks to merge methods of computer engineering based computation with advanced neuroscience to establish a computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) to detect RBD via measurement and analysis of the phasic electromyographic activity metric (PEM). The sponsor (Bliwise) has provided evidence based on traditional visual analyses from ""expert"" scorers that PEM recorded during sleep is a sensitive indicator a) to differentiate PD patients from controls [7]; b) to distinguish non-PD patients with a history of RBD from controls [8]; and c) to differentiate PD patients with early and late stage disease [9]. These data suggest that computer-aided PEM detection within a user-friendly CDSS will be vital for clinicians to determine prognosis, track disease course, and, possibly, even monitor treatment.           The proposed work is envisioned as a vital and integral component to establish standardized computerized bio-signal processing methods to detect phasic muscle activity in overnight human sleep polysomnograms for the identification and treatment of Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder.

"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.            ",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8505855,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2013,365000,0.009359556884745653
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8424238,K99NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory system', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2013,90662,-0.01002313733680063
"Fully Implantable and Programmable Spike-based Codecs for Neuroprosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Often the disability is so severe that it is not possible to feed oneself or readily communicate. A new class of medical system termed brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has emerged from research labs in the past decade and is now poised to dramatically improve these patients' quality of life. BMIs ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decode these electrical impulses in order to determine the intended movement. Initial versions of BMI systems that control a computer cursor are now in FDA Phase-I clinical trials, and numerous agencies are actively engaged in clinical translation (e.g., NIH, DARPA, VA). Creating control signals to enable an amputee to feed himself with a prosthetic (robotic) arm and hand will require decoding signals from thousands of electrodes, rather than the hundred or so signals current systems read, as well as encoding thousands of sensor signals from the arm and hand into thousands of artificial neural signals to be ""written into"" the brain, which has not yet been attempted. The lack of low-power (so that it can be implanted) electronic circuitry needed to run BMIs' encoding and decoding algorithms (termed codecs) is a fundamental barrier to successful clinical translation. The technologies available until now are too power-hungry (digital) or too algorithmically inflexible (analog) to meet the challenge. Recent advances in neuromorphic engineering make it now possible to build a fully implantable and programmable codec chip. This innovative approach combines digital's and analog's best features-programmability and efficiency-while offering far greater robustness than either. Meanwhile recent advances in neuroscience techniques make it now possible to obtain the knowledge needed to design the right algorithms to run on our codec chip. Optogenetic stimulaton can now be used to drive neurons in macaque cortex and computer vision can now be used to track freely moving monkeys while recording wirelessly. We propose to leverage these recent advances to dramatically increase prosthetic performance through the principled design of: (1) An entirely new class of encoders that can spatio-temporally pattern neural activity via optogenetic techniques. (2) An entirely new class of decoders that can operate in the real world with animals moving freely around in far less constrained settings. (3) An entirely new class of implantable programmable electronics that achieves the level of energy- efficiency required to run these complex algorithms. We will demonstrate our success by having a freely moving primate, with a 96-microelectrode recording array and a 9-channel optogenetic stimulator implanted in its premotor and somatosensory cortex, respectively, control a human-like robotic arm. Our ultimate goal is to realize the neuromorphic engineer's dream: Helping untold millions with neurological injury by replacing damaged neural tissue with chips that work like the brain.           Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decodes these signals in order to execute the intended movement with a robotic arm.

"Object Concepts  Project Summary What does it mean to know something about the world? Central to any theory of knowledge is a theory of concepts, those mental representations that allow us to categorize information in the world. In this project, we attempt to understand concepts by studying their neural instantiation. The central aim of this project is to advance our understanding of the neural representation of concepts via a characterization of similarity. The broader goal of this research program is to develop a strategy for understanding the neural representation of all types of knowledge; however, to make this problem more tractable, we are focusing on a specific type of concept - concrete objects - and on a particular type of knowledge about those concepts - their visual appearance. Specifically, (1) We aim to describe the neural representation of object concepts by characterizing neural tuning to features in a multidimensional similarity space; (2) We aim to examine variation in the neural representations of object concepts, across concepts, across individuals, and across attentional states; (3) We aim to explore to role of sleep-dependent consolidation processes in the acquisition of new object concept knowledge; (4) We aim to develop innovative methods for the characterization of neural similarity more generally.  Narrative Without concepts, we would be unable to make sense of the infinite variation in the world. Concepts organize our experiences, and they alter perception, memory, language, and action. The goal of this project is to understand the way in which conceptual knowledge is organized and the manner in which it is implemented in the brain. We will apply innovative neuroscientific methods to discover how we learn about the objects around us and how we access that information when remembering those objects.",Object Concepts,8537463,R01EY021717,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Solutions', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'austin', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mental representation', 'novel', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2013,374225,0.011110141026123978
"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding. The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes  sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders  of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering,  mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to artificial intelligence and  neural prosthetics; smarter cochlear implants can be built, as well as devices acting downstream of the cochlea  could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves.",Coding of auditory space in the avian brain,8521234,R01DC007690,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Physiology', 'Auditory system', 'Barn Owls', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear nucleus', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Ear', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Link', 'Location', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosencephalon', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Saccades', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sound Localization', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Strigiformes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Thalamic structure', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory nuclei', 'auditory pathway', 'base', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'operation', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sound', 'theories']",NIDCD,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2013,324389,0.01084644487382835
"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,8444787,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,246375,0.013830825296425656
"CRCNS: Hybrid non-invasive brain-machine interfaces for 3D object manipulation Interacting with the physical environment and manipulating objects is an essential part of daily life. This ability is lost in upper-limb amputees as well as patients with spinal cord injury, stroke, ALS and other movement disorders. These people know what they want to do as well as how they would do it if their arms were functional. If such knowledge is decoded and sent to a prosthetic arm (or to the patient's own arm fitted with functional electric stimulators) the lost motor function could be restored. The decoding is unlikely to be perfect however the brain can adapt to an imperfect decoder using real-time feedback. Several groups including ours have recently demonstrated that at least in principle this can be achieved. However, as is often the case in science, the initial work has been done in idealized conditions and its applicability to real-world usage scenarios remains an open question. The goal of this project is to bring movement control brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) closer to helping the people who need them, and at the same time exploit the rich datasets we collect in order to advance our understanding of sensorimotor control and learning. This will be accomplished by creating hybrid BMIs which exploit information from multiple sources, combined with modern algorithms from machine learning and automatic control.

"Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.              This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials.

"Can neuroscience dramatically improve our ability to design health communications     DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)    Abstract: Can neuroscience dramatically improve our ability to design health communications? Modifiable health behaviors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and alcohol consumption are leading causes of morbidity and mortaiity, both in the United Statesl and throughout the developed world2; yet changing these behaviors has proved an immensely challenging problem. Classic behavior change theories provide a foundation to develop and understand effective health campaigns and interventions;3 however there is still considerable variability in the effectiveness of such campaigns that we are unable to predict and explain. By improving our ability to understand and predict behavior change, neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl) may aid in the creation of maximally effective health campaigns. There may be important precursors of behavior change that are not easily obtained through self-reports, but that can be assessed with fMRl. In particular, people are notoriously limited in their ability to predict their own future  o. behavior and accurately identiy their internal mental processes through verbal and written self-report Our team has found that activity in a prioridefined neural regions of interest can double the proportion of variance explained in individual behavior change following persuasive messaging, beyond self-report measures (e.9. attitudes, intentions, self-efficacy).5'6 The current proposal posits a next leap: neuroimaging technology may also be applied to more accurately forecast population level responses to health communications, and could dramatically improve the way that we design and select health communications. To this end, we propose to: (1) identify the neurocognitive signatures of health communications that are successful at changing behavior at the population level; (2) use these maps to forecast the success of new health messages; and, (3) use the information gained about underlying mechanisms of message success to advance theory and to develop novel strategies for message design. We will employ sophisticated multivariate and machine learning data analysis techniques (e.9. reinforcement learning models and pattern classification) to characterize the neural systems that are involved in processing successful health messages (i.e. messages that ultimately facilitate behavior change in larger, independent groups). Such techniques will provide insight about the mechanisms that lead messages to be optimally effective for populations on average, as well as helping to understand heterogeneity within populations (i.e. for whom are given messages likely to be most effective). These techniques will also allow us to define models that optimally combine neuroimaging data with other available data sources (e.9. self-report). Achievement of our goals (to identify neural patterns that predict message success and to test the psychological meaning of these activations) will facilitate the design and dissemination of more effective health messages, and will allow more efficient translation of core theoretical advances across behavior and disease specific silos.    Public Health Relevance: Modifiable health behaviors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and alcohol consumption are leading causes of morbidity and mortality, both in the United States1 and throughout the developed world2; yet changing these behaviors has proved an immensely challenging problem.

"The Neural Bases of he Semantic Structure of Words and Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to discover the neural representation of some simple words and concepts. It uses newly developed machine learning techniques and dimension reduction methods applied to fMRI brain activation data that will be acquired in new experimental paradigms. This research approach has for the first time succeeded in identifying the content of individual human thoughts based on the pattern of brain activity. The initial published studies have demonstrated this capability in the case of concrete nouns and physical objects. This project proposes to expand the approach to a much larger set of different types of concepts and to examine the effect of the way the concept is presented (e.g. a written or spoken word, or a picture). The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of how neural representations of meaning arise from the various brain systems that are used in interacting or considering the concept. An important secondary goal is to determine the degree of commonality of the neural representations across people.  The studies propose to examine the neural dimensions of meaning in three domains: (a) physical objects; (b) human traits, emotions, and interpersonal interactions; and (c) small numerical quantities. This set of semantic domains is expected to provide sufficient breadth to reveal some of the principle neural bases of semantic representation.  In contrast to the field of ""semantics"" (the study of the relation between words and their meanings), this project will help establish a new research area, neurosemantics, which is the study of the relation between words, thoughts, and their neural representations. The key assumption is that the underlying dimensions of meaning representation in the human brain are derived from basic neural systems. For example, one of the dimensions of representation of a physical object is how one physically interacts with or handles it. This dimension of representation is underpinned by a network of cortical areas that co-activate when one thinks about a physical object, and also when one actually handles the physical object. Other dimensions of neural representation similarly emerge when the concept is encountered. The studies will collectively identify the major dimensions of concept representation and relate them to networks of co-activating brain areas.  The cumulative knowledge from the completed project will provide the framework of a theory of how brain systems map onto the representation of the meaning of concepts. The theory will be applicable to understanding and designing therapies for neurological conditions in which the meanings of concepts are distorted, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and autism. The resulting theory will be foundational in relating the representation of meaning to brain function.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy. More generally, as a recent review (Bray et al., 2009) indicates, the new approach provides a good match to the brain characteristics of several brain disorders, and it is beginning to be applied for health-related purposes in many domains.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.                  Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia.

"CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intellectual Merit: There is compelling evidence that the distinct stages of sleep play an essential role in the long-term consolidation of memories (Marshall & Born 2007). Specifically, slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is hallmarked by slow oscillatory activity (< 1 Hz) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG), has been implicated in memory consolidation. We demonstrated that weak electric currents (<1mA, <1Hz and DC) applied to the scalp during SWS modulate these endogenous EEG rhythms and can improve human memory performance (Marshall 2006a). Moreover, application of the same weak currents during learning modulates ongoing EEG rhythms that are typical for the awake state in humans and boosts immediate performance in some learning tasks (Kirov 2009). Yet, despite these remarkable phenomenological findings, the question of how weak currents can modulate brain oscillations and induce plastic changes in brain function remains fundamentally unaddressed. Here we propose to quantitatively address this question through the development of computational models that are tightly constrained by specialized brain-slice experiments and validated through targeted human subject experiments. A central question is: how can weak electric currents, that appear insufficient to modulate excitability or plasticity in quiescent neurons, exert such a powerful effect on oscillations and learning? Our central hypothesis is that weak currents couple into ongoing slow oscillatory activity that then boost their modulatory effect on synaptic plasticity. Preliminary data from our group and others already provides strong evidence for modulation of endogenous rhythmic network activity by applied currents - at intensities considered too weak to affect single neuron function. Concurrently, we and other groups have investigated links between slow wave activity and memory consolidation, including by application of weak currents in human. But a specific connection between the effects of applied weak currents on slow-wave rhythms and plasticity has so far not been explored. Guided by computational models, the crucial empirical link between the two will be sought by probing lasting changes resulting from weak-current stimulation of an in vitro cortical preparation that exhibits SWA. Targeted human experiments will directly test if applied currents also enhance the consolidation of other SWS-mediated learning as the hypothesis would suggest, or rather, if the effect is limited to hippocampus-related learning, thus providing significant constraints to the computational models.    Broader Impacts: Weak applied currents are being explored in a number of empirical studies for their potential benefits to treat depression and neuropathic pain, to assist motor learning after stroke, or more generally, to enhance cognitive performance and to improve learning. The promise of this technique is that weak currents can be applied non-invasively with a potentially broad range of applications and minimal side effects. The enigma in this potentially transformative clinical tool, however, is that the electric field strengths generated by these currents in most studies are two orders of magnitude below what is required to activate an otherwise silent neuron. Currently, research in this area is almost entirely phenomenological and the few mechanistic explanations for the promising phenomenological observations are superficial (e.g. describing all brain function as a ""sliding scale of excitability"") and do not address plasticity - as such, there is no rational basis for improving and targeting stimulation protocols. This work is the first attempt at establishing the mechanistic link between applied currents on endogenous rhythms and the associated SWS-related learning enhancements. Evidently, such an analysis will address basic science questions about the link between endogenous SWS and learning, add to the set of experimental tools which can be used to study cognition, and, shed light on the functional and causal role of the ubiquitous endogenous rhythms generated by the brain.    Consistent with present call for US/German Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience this project will combined the expertise of international researchers in the areas of: (1) effects of noninvasive electrical stimulation on nervous tissue (Bikson, US), EEG signal analysis and computational network models (Parra, US), human sleep and learning with applied currents (Marshall, Germany), and dynamical systems and machine learning (Claussen/Martinetz, Germany; Parra, US).           n/a",CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep,8286826,R01MH092926,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Chemosensitization', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Models', 'Frequencies', 'German population', 'Germany', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'International', 'Ion Channel', 'Kale - dietary', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'density', 'electric field', 'human subject', 'imprint', 'improved', 'memory trace reactivation', 'motor learning', 'neocortical', 'painful neuropathy', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIMH,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2012,124361,-0.004998864613560955
"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories. These waves exhibit spatial patterns that may help guide the proper function of the hippocampus. This work could potentially explain how distortions in electrical activity relate to defects in people's abilities to form and recall memories.

"Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Our overarching goal is to establish an animal model of freely moving humans. We choose to do so in order to directly measure the context-dependency of motor cortical activity and, ultimately, other activity reliant upon free movement such as social interaction among animals. Achieving this major technological challenge requires  a complete system that includes (Specific Aim 1) wireless transmission of neural data from electrode arrays chronically implanted in monkeys, (Specific Aim 2) computer-vision algorithms to automatically extract body and limb orientation during free movement, and (Specific Aim 3) new mathematical and computational models  to represent and extract information from high-dimensional neural and behavioral activity. This technology will enable an animal model of freely moving humans that will advance the development of cortical neural prostheses by providing models of the context-dependant nature of motor cortical control.   Unlike traditional laboratory environments used to study animal movement, human amputees and tetraplegics operate in a variety of contexts that involve their movement in the world. Understanding the motor control of complex movement in these natural settings is absolutely critical for future advances in cortically-controlled prostheses. Given our overarching goal, our hypothesis is that motor cortical activity (e.g.,  directional tuning curves, absolute firing rates, correlations among units, etc.) will be different in important ways when rhesus monkeys perform the same reaching arm movements in an un-constrained context (e.g., not sitting quietly, not head restrained, not in dark and quiet room, etc.) as in a traditional, highly constrained context. Our three Specific Aims will put in place the electronic, computational and mathematical technology  necessary to address this hypothesis, and also to make such studies of free behavior in rhesus monkeys possible.  The innovative integration of neural engineering, neuroscience, computer vision, mathematics and neural modeling will provide new tools to enable the unprecedented study of motor control during natural, unconstrained behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research project is directly relevant to both basic neuroscience studies of higher brain function and to neural prosthesis research aimed at, ultimately, helping patients with motor disorders. We will conduct neurophysiological and behavioral experiments with rhesus monkeys in two different contexts - ""in home cage""  and ""in rig"" - to investigate the context dependence of motor cortical activity. With this knowledge, we will then design ""context independent"" models of the neural-behavioral relationship which we, and other researchers, could then use in neural prosthetic experiments while monkeys freely move around their less-constrained home cages.",Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans,8290387,R01NS066311,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Robotics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Technology', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Wireless Technology', 'arm', 'computer science', 'design', 'free behavior', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neural model', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'skills', 'tool', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,227048,0.0013633292072401004
"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing.

"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.                This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function.

"Fully Implantable and Programmable Spike-based Codecs for Neuroprosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Often the disability is so severe that it is not possible to feed oneself or readily communicate. A new class of medical system termed brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has emerged from research labs in the past decade and is now poised to dramatically improve these patients' quality of life. BMIs ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decode these electrical impulses in order to determine the intended movement. Initial versions of BMI systems that control a computer cursor are now in FDA Phase-I clinical trials, and numerous agencies are actively engaged in clinical translation (e.g., NIH, DARPA, VA). Creating control signals to enable an amputee to feed himself with a prosthetic (robotic) arm and hand will require decoding signals from thousands of electrodes, rather than the hundred or so signals current systems read, as well as encoding thousands of sensor signals from the arm and hand into thousands of artificial neural signals to be ""written into"" the brain, which has not yet been attempted. The lack of low-power (so that it can be implanted) electronic circuitry needed to run BMIs' encoding and decoding algorithms (termed codecs) is a fundamental barrier to successful clinical translation. The technologies available until now are too power-hungry (digital) or too algorithmically inflexible (analog) to meet the challenge. Recent advances in neuromorphic engineering make it now possible to build a fully implantable and programmable codec chip. This innovative approach combines digital's and analog's best features-programmability and efficiency-while offering far greater robustness than either. Meanwhile recent advances in neuroscience techniques make it now possible to obtain the knowledge needed to design the right algorithms to run on our codec chip. Optogenetic stimulaton can now be used to drive neurons in macaque cortex and computer vision can now be used to track freely moving monkeys while recording wirelessly. We propose to leverage these recent advances to dramatically increase prosthetic performance through the principled design of: (1) An entirely new class of encoders that can spatio-temporally pattern neural activity via optogenetic techniques. (2) An entirely new class of decoders that can operate in the real world with animals moving freely around in far less constrained settings. (3) An entirely new class of implantable programmable electronics that achieves the level of energy- efficiency required to run these complex algorithms. We will demonstrate our success by having a freely moving primate, with a 96-microelectrode recording array and a 9-channel optogenetic stimulator implanted in its premotor and somatosensory cortex, respectively, control a human-like robotic arm. Our ultimate goal is to realize the neuromorphic engineer's dream: Helping untold millions with neurological injury by replacing damaged neural tissue with chips that work like the brain.           Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decodes these signals in order to execute the intended movement with a robotic arm.

"Spinal Epidural Electrode Array to Facilitate Standing and Stepping After SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load- bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with pharmacological and motor training interventions.  Within the first 2.5 years of the present BRP Grant, not within the five years as initially proposed, we have gathered sufficient data to demonstrate that the human lumbosacral spinal cord has similar capabilities.  We have shown that an individual with a motor complete spinal cord injury can regain independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation after months of testing different spinal cord stimulation patterns and motor training.  Just as important and as impressive is the recovery of significant levels of bladder control, blood pressure, and temperature regulation, and even sexual function in this patient (13a).  These intriguing results compel us to begin additional efforts to overcome what are now recognized as the most critical factors limiting our progress toward making this intervention available in the clinic.  Based on our results, it is clear that we can develop the capability to selectively activae combinations of neural networks that can enable standing and probably stepping with improved technology in humans with a functionally motor complete spinal cord injury.  These functional improvements are even more likely to benefit those individuals that are functionally motor incomplete, but have severely impaired mobility.  Our present accomplishments have been realized using technology that is three decades old and initially designed for a different purpose, i.e., pain management.  Thus we are requesting funds to overcome the present technical, not physiological, limitations as expediently and as carefully as possible.  More specifically, the rat limiting factors are the lack of technology for chronic implants for a high number of electrodes and the need for a more clear understanding of how these epidural stimulation arrays can modulate the spinal circuitries.  To overcome these factors we need to 1) develop a device that will allow us to chronically implant an integrated electrode array and multiplexed stimulation device in rats with the necessary signal control capabilities, 2) evaluate hypotheses that will guide us to more clearly understand how to modulate the stimulation parameters to activate the desired spinal circuits, 3) develop a learning strategy to automatically optimize the stimulation parameters for a given patient to stand, step, or exert voluntary control, and 4) begin to explore the pathways through which voluntary control can be regained after a severe spinal cord injury.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It now seems possible to develop a technology that will enable the recovery of postural and locomotor function in humans after a motor complete spinal cord injury.  This technology includes the capability to stimulate the lower spinal cord in a manner that can enable a patient with complete paraplegia to stand and to step.  This project outlines the newly recognized technical capabilities that must be developed to accomplish this goal.                   It now seems possible to develop a technology that will enable the recovery of postural and locomotor function in humans after a motor complete spinal cord injury.

"Object Concepts  Project Summary What does it mean to know something about the world? Central to any theory of knowledge is a theory of concepts, those mental representations that allow us to categorize information in the world. In this project, we attempt to understand concepts by studying their neural instantiation. The central aim of this project is to advance our understanding of the neural representation of concepts via a characterization of similarity. The broader goal of this research program is to develop a strategy for understanding the neural representation of all types of knowledge; however, to make this problem more tractable, we are focusing on a specific type of concept - concrete objects - and on a particular type of knowledge about those concepts - their visual appearance. Specifically, (1) We aim to describe the neural representation of object concepts by characterizing neural tuning to features in a multidimensional similarity space; (2) We aim to examine variation in the neural representations of object concepts, across concepts, across individuals, and across attentional states; (3) We aim to explore to role of sleep-dependent consolidation processes in the acquisition of new object concept knowledge; (4) We aim to develop innovative methods for the characterization of neural similarity more generally.  Narrative Without concepts, we would be unable to make sense of the infinite variation in the world. Concepts organize our experiences, and they alter perception, memory, language, and action. The goal of this project is to understand the way in which conceptual knowledge is organized and the manner in which it is implemented in the brain. We will apply innovative neuroscientific methods to discover how we learn about the objects around us and how we access that information when remembering those objects.",Object Concepts,8312494,R01EY021717,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Solutions', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'austin', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mental representation', 'novel', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2012,393921,0.011110141026123978
"Independent Component Analysis Based Support Vector Machine Classification Method    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional MRI (fMRI) techniques have provided the addiction field with a unique and profoundly valuable ability to explore brain mechanisms in human subjects. Despite the resultant advances in our understanding of neural mechanisms, the diagnostic utility of neuroimaging methods has not been realized. In addition, our ability to assess the reactivity of neural networks over time remains limited. To explore new approaches to further our understanding and diagnosis of substance use disorders, this proposal will utilize novel and powerful analytic methods to assess an existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set in cocaine-addicted subjects and healthy controls. The PI, new to the substance abuse field, will bring analytic approaches developed in other areas of investigation to the field of addiction. The broad goal of this project is to examine differentiations of brain functions in cocaine-addicted subjects using fMRI data and to reveal functional connectivity between regions involving disinhibition and decision-making tasks. This study will exploit data from an ongoing NIDA-funded study, ""Impulsivity, Neural Deficits and Cocaine Addiction."" This study assesses BOLD response during a motor disinhibition task and a decision- making task of response reversal as well as basal measures of interconnectivity measures during rest. A data driven entropy-based algorithm, independent component analysis (ICA), will be used to extract spatially independent regions that show differences in addicted and control subjects (Aim 1). We hypothesize that the proposed method will identify certain groups of voxels (not necessarily spatially connected) serving separation of two groups who are under disinhibition and decision-making tasks. To uncover how the functional connectivity changes over time between those differentiated regions, we will perform dynamic (changes over short time) dynamic functional network connectivity (DFNC) analysis using various window sizes on time course (Aim 2). These findings are expected to reveal a temporal distinction between ICA-derived network changes in cocaine-addicted and healthy control populations. Since the first aim will find significantly discriminative clouds of voxels, we will use a machine-learning algorithm, the support vector machines (SVM), to automatically map a subject into one of the groups, cocaine-addicted or control, by using subject's fMRI data (Aim 3). We hypothesize that SVM based subject classification tool will provide high sensitivity in selection between the two groups. The framework potentially offers a useful clinical diagnostic instrument as well as demonstrating key brain neural differences between the groups. The last aim is designed to reveal dynamic connectivity between pairs of given anatomic regions of relevance, such as the mesial prefrontal cortex (PFC), inferior PFC, insular cortex, and anterior cingulate (for the disinhibition task) and the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate (for the decision-making task). We hypothesize that a clear boundary will be observed in interaction patterns of two groups regarding two tasks. The contrast between brain regions in fMRI data of cocaine-addicted and control subjects will be investigated for the first time using very powerful data analysis tool (ICA) and will be used in classification framework of SVM. The proposal will bring together two extremely innovative techniques (DFNC and SVM) and a promising junior investigator into the field of addiction. The utilization of a pre-existing database offers a highly cost-effective approach to a clinically important, perplexing and persistent problem in the field.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The abuse and dependence of stimulants is a major public health problem with significant health, legal, social and occupational associated costs. While biologically-oriented studies, particularly those using imaging techniques, have produced significant advances in our understanding of brain activity relevant to the development and persistence of addiction, this knowledge has done little to assist in the diagnosis of these disorders. This study will bring statistical procedures used in other fields of research to imaging data obtained from cocaine-addicted subjects to assess changes in brain networks and determine whether the cocaine-addicted patients can be distinguished from non-cocaine using subjects.            The abuse and dependence of stimulants is a major public health problem with significant health, legal, social and occupational associated costs.

"The Neural Bases of he Semantic Structure of Words and Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to discover the neural representation of some simple words and concepts. It uses newly developed machine learning techniques and dimension reduction methods applied to fMRI brain activation data that will be acquired in new experimental paradigms. This research approach has for the first time succeeded in identifying the content of individual human thoughts based on the pattern of brain activity. The initial published studies have demonstrated this capability in the case of concrete nouns and physical objects. This project proposes to expand the approach to a much larger set of different types of concepts and to examine the effect of the way the concept is presented (e.g. a written or spoken word, or a picture). The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of how neural representations of meaning arise from the various brain systems that are used in interacting or considering the concept. An important secondary goal is to determine the degree of commonality of the neural representations across people.  The studies propose to examine the neural dimensions of meaning in three domains: (a) physical objects; (b) human traits, emotions, and interpersonal interactions; and (c) small numerical quantities. This set of semantic domains is expected to provide sufficient breadth to reveal some of the principle neural bases of semantic representation.  In contrast to the field of ""semantics"" (the study of the relation between words and their meanings), this project will help establish a new research area, neurosemantics, which is the study of the relation between words, thoughts, and their neural representations. The key assumption is that the underlying dimensions of meaning representation in the human brain are derived from basic neural systems. For example, one of the dimensions of representation of a physical object is how one physically interacts with or handles it. This dimension of representation is underpinned by a network of cortical areas that co-activate when one thinks about a physical object, and also when one actually handles the physical object. Other dimensions of neural representation similarly emerge when the concept is encountered. The studies will collectively identify the major dimensions of concept representation and relate them to networks of co-activating brain areas.  The cumulative knowledge from the completed project will provide the framework of a theory of how brain systems map onto the representation of the meaning of concepts. The theory will be applicable to understanding and designing therapies for neurological conditions in which the meanings of concepts are distorted, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and autism. The resulting theory will be foundational in relating the representation of meaning to brain function.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy. More generally, as a recent review (Bray et al., 2009) indicates, the new approach provides a good match to the brain characteristics of several brain disorders, and it is beginning to be applied for health-related purposes in many domains.              PROJECT NARRATIVE - RELEVANCE  The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy.

"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology. On its successful completion, based on specific milestones, we will move to the more applied work with human subjects.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. We are interested specifically in states and markers of impulsivity and cigarette craving. Our goal ultimately is to have a tool that can be used in the context of neurofeedback, allowing human subject or patient to receive an indication of activity in their brains associated with these states and to enable them to learn to control these cognitive/affective states by controlling the brain activity.           Project Narrative Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program. The proposed BRP will be lead by Drs. De Luca, Roy, and Adam, key personnel from Boston University (BU) with expertise in biomedical engineering and EMG system development. Signal processing/software development will be provided by the leadership from Dr. Nawab through BU's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

"Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and related electroencephalography (EEG) use an array of sensors to non-invasively measure electromagnetic (EM) fields produced by synchronous current activity within the brain. While the temporal resolution is excellent relative to other functional imaging modalities, accurately localizing in 3D space the sources of brain activity involves solving a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. Existing localization methods used clinically and for research purposes maintain significant shortcomings, including the inability to resolve complex source configurations, bias caused by source correlations, and sensitivity to sources of noise and interference. The latter can arise from eye blinks, heart beats, sensor imperfections, and industrial noise as well as from spontaneous background brain activity not associated with the brain sources of interest. Additionally, prototype algorithms ostensibly designed to deal with some of these issues are heuristic in nature and have not been rigorously evaluated or compared, making their ultimate utility difficult to assess for neuroelectromagnetic imaging practitioners. The proposed research plan addresses all of these concerns by developing a principled localization scheme that unifies and extends existing localization strategies using modern concepts from Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Based on the notion of automatic relevance determination (ARD), brain regions with probable (relevant) activity are located with high spatial resolution. Interference sources are effectively removed by integrating with a variation factor analysis model. To quantify the improvement afforded by the proposed methodology, source location estimates will be compared with standard algorithms using realistic simulations, near-ground-truth data obtained from invasive electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings, and surgical data. The result will be implemented as a user-friendly localization toolbox and made freely available to the community by integrating with existing open-source functional brain imaging software. Non-invasive mapping of brain activity with high spatio-temporal resolution has important consequences for basic neuroscience studies of human cognition. It also has profound implications for the diagnosis, characterization and treatment of various neurological, neurooncological, mental health, developmental, and communication disorders. For example, localizations of brain sources are used to map cognitive function in epileptogenic areas and in neighboring brain regions. Such brain mapping procedures are then useful to guide neurosurgical planning, navigation, and resection and to minimize post-operative deficits.           n/a",Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones,7942859,F32NS061395,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic pedigree', 'heuristics', 'human CYP2B6 protein', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'operation', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2011,19755,-0.010616624215900915
"CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intellectual Merit: There is compelling evidence that the distinct stages of sleep play an essential role in the long-term consolidation of memories (Marshall & Born 2007). Specifically, slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is hallmarked by slow oscillatory activity (< 1 Hz) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG), has been implicated in memory consolidation. We demonstrated that weak electric currents (<1mA, <1Hz and DC) applied to the scalp during SWS modulate these endogenous EEG rhythms and can improve human memory performance (Marshall 2006a). Moreover, application of the same weak currents during learning modulates ongoing EEG rhythms that are typical for the awake state in humans and boosts immediate performance in some learning tasks (Kirov 2009). Yet, despite these remarkable phenomenological findings, the question of how weak currents can modulate brain oscillations and induce plastic changes in brain function remains fundamentally unaddressed. Here we propose to quantitatively address this question through the development of computational models that are tightly constrained by specialized brain-slice experiments and validated through targeted human subject experiments. A central question is: how can weak electric currents, that appear insufficient to modulate excitability or plasticity in quiescent neurons, exert such a powerful effect on oscillations and learning? Our central hypothesis is that weak currents couple into ongoing slow oscillatory activity that then boost their modulatory effect on synaptic plasticity. Preliminary data from our group and others already provides strong evidence for modulation of endogenous rhythmic network activity by applied currents - at intensities considered too weak to affect single neuron function. Concurrently, we and other groups have investigated links between slow wave activity and memory consolidation, including by application of weak currents in human. But a specific connection between the effects of applied weak currents on slow-wave rhythms and plasticity has so far not been explored. Guided by computational models, the crucial empirical link between the two will be sought by probing lasting changes resulting from weak-current stimulation of an in vitro cortical preparation that exhibits SWA. Targeted human experiments will directly test if applied currents also enhance the consolidation of other SWS-mediated learning as the hypothesis would suggest, or rather, if the effect is limited to hippocampus-related learning, thus providing significant constraints to the computational models.    Broader Impacts: Weak applied currents are being explored in a number of empirical studies for their potential benefits to treat depression and neuropathic pain, to assist motor learning after stroke, or more generally, to enhance cognitive performance and to improve learning. The promise of this technique is that weak currents can be applied non-invasively with a potentially broad range of applications and minimal side effects. The enigma in this potentially transformative clinical tool, however, is that the electric field strengths generated by these currents in most studies are two orders of magnitude below what is required to activate an otherwise silent neuron. Currently, research in this area is almost entirely phenomenological and the few mechanistic explanations for the promising phenomenological observations are superficial (e.g. describing all brain function as a ""sliding scale of excitability"") and do not address plasticity - as such, there is no rational basis for improving and targeting stimulation protocols. This work is the first attempt at establishing the mechanistic link between applied currents on endogenous rhythms and the associated SWS-related learning enhancements. Evidently, such an analysis will address basic science questions about the link between endogenous SWS and learning, add to the set of experimental tools which can be used to study cognition, and, shed light on the functional and causal role of the ubiquitous endogenous rhythms generated by the brain.    Consistent with present call for US/German Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience this project will combined the expertise of international researchers in the areas of: (1) effects of noninvasive electrical stimulation on nervous tissue (Bikson, US), EEG signal analysis and computational network models (Parra, US), human sleep and learning with applied currents (Marshall, Germany), and dynamical systems and machine learning (Claussen/Martinetz, Germany; Parra, US).           n/a",CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep,8150936,R01MH092926,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Chemosensitization', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Models', 'Frequencies', 'German population', 'Germany', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'International', 'Ion Channel', 'Kale - dietary', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'density', 'electric field', 'human subject', 'imprint', 'improved', 'memory trace reactivation', 'motor learning', 'neocortical', 'painful neuropathy', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIMH,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2011,124361,-0.004998864613560955
"Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans Our overarching goal is to establish an animal model of freely moving humans. We choose to do so in order to directly measure the context-dependency of motor cortical activity and, ultimately, other activity reliant upon free movement such as social interaction among animals. Achieving this major technological challenge requires a complete system that includes (Specific Aim 1) wireless transmission of neural data from electrode arrays chronically implanted in monkeys, (Specific Aim 2) computer-vision algorithms to automatically extract body and limb orientation during free movement, and (Specific Aim 3) new mathematical and computational models to represent and extract information from high-dimensional neural and behavioral activity. This technology will enable an animal model of freely moving humans that will advance the development of cortical neural prostheses by providing models of the context-dependant nature of motor cortical control.  Unlike traditional laboratory environments used to study animal movement, human amputees and tetraplegics operate in a variety of contexts that involve their movement in the world. Understanding the motor control of complex movement in these natural settings is absolutely critical for future advances in cortically- controlled prostheses. Given our overarching goal, our hypothesis is that motor cortical activity (e.g., directional tuning curves, absolute firing rates, correlations among units, etc.) will be different in important ways when rhesus monkeys perform the same reaching arm movements in an un-constrained context (e.g., not sitting quietly, not head restrained, not in dark and quiet room, etc.) as in a traditional, highly constrained context. Our three Specific Aims will put in place the electronic, computational and mathematical technology necessary to address this hypothesis, and also to make such studies of free behavior in rhesus monkeys possible. The innovative integration of neural engineering, neuroscience, computer vision, mathematics and neural modeling will provide new tools to enable the unprecedented study of motor control during natural, unconstrained behavior.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research project is directly relevant to both basic neuroscience studies of higher brain function and to neural prosthesis research aimed at, ultimately, helping patients with motor disorders. We will conduct neurophysiological and behavioral experiments with rhesus monkeys in two different contexts - ""in home cage"" and ""in rig"" - to investigate the context dependence of motor cortical activity. With this knowledge, we will then design ""context independent"" models of the neural-behavioral relationship which we, and other researchers, could then use in neural prosthetic experiments while monkeys freely move around their less- constrained home cages.",Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans,8094411,R01NS066311,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Social Interaction', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Technology', 'Wireless Technology', 'arm', 'design', 'free behavior', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neural model', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,1141716,0.0014913146191939035
"CRCNS: fMRI Pattern Analysis of Neural Correlates of Natural Scene Categories    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For over half a century, vision scientists have been decomposing visual scenes into simple, more tractable components in an attempt to understand how the brain accomplishes vision. Although this endeavor has revealed much about the specialized subsystems of vision, surprisingly little is know about how, or even where in the brain, we process scenes as a whole. How is it, for instance, that the brain determines whether it is looking at a forest or a city skyline? One reason for the paucity of research on this topic may be that the neural representation of a scene is likely to be highly distributed, a coding scheme not easily identified by many traditional neuroscience methods. The objective of the proposed research is to use a new method of analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that is designed to leverage activity patterns across the brain, in order to better understand how the brain categorizes natural scenes. In particular, the project combines expertise from computer vision and neuroimaging by applying statistical pattern recognition algorithms to fMRI data to understand how the brain distinguishes between different categories of natural scene (e.g., a beach versus a highway). The proposed project will use and develop a statistical pattern recognition approach to fMRI analysis to accomplish three more specific objectives: (i) to identify the neural representation of natural scene categories, (ii) to identify the computational principles for forming and using the neural representation of natural scene categories, and (iii) to explore the effects of attention and expectation on natural scene categorization. The insights gained from these experiments will be verified in a computational model of natural scene perception, which in turn will generate predictions for future experiments. Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: Although previous research has shown that humans can quickly and effortless categorize natural scenes, there is very little understanding of how this is accomplished in the brain. The research proposed here will significantly advance our understanding of how natural scenes are represented in the brain and begin to uncover the computational strategies the brain employs in quickly and accurately extracting the gist of a scene. Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity: The highly interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research requires intense interactions among psychologists, neuroscientists, and computer vision researchers. As such, the project not only promises to increase communication among very different disciplines but it will also to provide doctoral students with truly interdisciplinary training. The PIs are committed to providing a highly interactive research environment, mentoring students across disciplines, and fostering the interdisciplinary approach to science in general. Moreover, two of the three PIs are women working in fields in which women are traditionally underrepresented and are committed to improving the representation and visibility of women in science. Finally, the principles derived from this project are likely to have implications beyond the domain of natural scene perception. By refining the pattern recognition algorithms and their application to fMRI data, the project will expand the set of tools available to neuroscientists wishing to study a whole host of complex human behaviors that likely depend on subtle but distributed patterns of activity in the brain.           n/a",CRCNS: fMRI Pattern Analysis of Neural Correlates of Natural Scene Categories,8142855,R01EY019429,"['Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Location', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Working Women', 'design', 'expectation', 'forest', 'improved', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neuroimaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'tool', 'vision science']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,311026,-0.007690324681261831
"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.

"Quantitative Analysis of PEM for REMBD Identification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder (RBD) refers to a condition in which patients act out their dreams and engage in potentially disruptive, injurious and even dangerous behavior while asleep[1-3]. Clinical reports of RBD have been shown to anticipate the development of neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's Disease by 20 years or more [4-6]. Despite this potential prognostic significance for human disease, the field of Sleep Medicine lacks an accepted computerized approach to quantify muscle activity in sleep. This proposed interdisciplinary research seeks to merge methods of computer engineering based computation with advanced neuroscience to establish a computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) to detect RBD via measurement and analysis of the phasic electromyographic activity metric (PEM). The sponsor (Bliwise) has provided evidence based on traditional visual analyses from ""expert"" scorers that PEM recorded during sleep is a sensitive indicator a) to differentiate PD patients from controls [7]; b) to distinguish non-PD patients with a history of RBD from controls [8]; and c) to differentiate PD patients with early and late stage disease [9]. These data suggest that computer-aided PEM detection within a user-friendly CDSS will be vital for clinicians to determine prognosis, track disease course, and, possibly, even monitor treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    The proposed work is envisioned as a vital and integral component to establish standardized computerized bio-signal processing methods to detect phasic muscle activity in overnight human sleep polysomnograms for the identification and treatment of Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder.                 The proposed work is envisioned as a vital and integral component to establish standardized computerized bio-signal processing methods to detect phasic muscle activity in overnight human sleep polysomnograms for the identification and treatment of Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder.            ",Quantitative Analysis of PEM for REMBD Identification,8203202,F32NS070572,"['Acting Out', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bypass', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dangerous Behavior', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lewy Body Disease', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized', 'computerized data processing', 'evidence base', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'rapid eye movement', 'sensor', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F32,2011,53042,-0.007439780361011035
"A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of advanced neuroprosthetic systems and brain-machine interfaces for high-capacity, real-time, bi-directional communication with the nervous system is a major challenge to the emerging neural engineering discipline.  While recent advances in the fabrication of high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs) for multiunit recording and stimulation have triggered numerous neurobiological discoveries, the resulting large data throughput and the variability of cortical responses over repeated trials preclude the ability to design a wireless, adaptive, fully implantable large-scale interface to the cortex.  This severely limits the feasibility and space of experimental paradigms needed to improve our understanding of the nervous system functionality and characterize cortical responses in freely behaving subjects interacting naturally with their surroundings.  The objective of this project is to develop a wireless interface to the cortex capable of processing simultaneously recorded neural signalsfrom 64 electrode channels in real time.  The project has 3 aims:  1.  Develop advanced signal processing algorithms for sensing and decoding neuronal response properties from distributed intra-cortical neural activity:  1) Optimize our existing signal processing algorithms for hardware implementation to extract the desired neural activity early in the data stream; 2) Develop new algorithms for decoding these responses to characterize the natural behavior of awake, behaving animal models.  2.  Design low-power integrated circuits and wireless telemetry for a 64 channel system:  1) Optimize the design of a low power Neural Interface Node (NIN) module to feature wireless communication and powering capability for subcutaneous implantation; 2) Design and fabricate an extracranial Manager Interface Module (MIM) to permit:  a) wireless powering and data exchange with up to 2 implanted NIN modules; b) wireless bidirectional exchange of data and control with a central base station.  3.  Demonstrate the system functionality in vitro and vivo:  1) Build a 32 channel system and test its performance in vitro in retinal slices and in vivo in awake behaving rodents; 2) Demonstrate the real time functionality of a 64 channel system in vitro and explore its feasibility in vivo; 3) Optimize the entire system design, and benchmark it against a commercial 64 channel wired data acquisition system.

"Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Over 600,000 Americans have severely impaired motor function from disorders including spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontine stroke, and cerebral palsy. A brain-machine interface (BMI) could enable locked-in or tetraplegic patients to communicate and interact with their environment. Two crucial decisions in designing a BMI are (1) what type of brain signals to use as inputs to a controller and (2) what methods to use to decode those signals. Most BMIs have used either noninvasive scalp EEG recordings or invasive intracortical recordings of single- or multi-neuron spikes as control inputs. A few have used subdural or intracortical local field potentials (LFPs). However, no group has yet systematically compared these signals in motor cortex for use in BMI applications. This proposal's first goal is to assess the relative performance of spikes and field potentials (both intracortical and epidural) as control inputs for a variety of movement-related outputs. Epidural field potentials (EFPs) are intermediate in invasiveness, signal quality, stability and spatial resolution compared with existing scalp, subdural, and intracortical recordings, and thus represent an unexplored middle ground. This proposal's second goal is to evaluate linear and nonlinear techniques-including several novel to BMI applications-for both decoding data and reducing the inherently large dimensionality of data from multiple neural signals. The primary hypotheses of the proposed project are (1) that spikes will perform better in decoding more complex movement-related outputs, but that field potentials may perform similarly on decoding simpler outputs, and (2) that nonlinear decoders and dimensionality-reduction techniques may provide improved accuracy over linear methods. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are 1) to evaluate single neuron spikes as inputs to decoders of movement- related outputs, 2) to develop a novel epidural multi-electrode recording technique in the macaque monkey, and 3) to evaluate field potential signals as inputs to decoders of movement-related outputs. Aims 1 and 3 will involve application of dimensionality-reduction algorithms (e.g., independent components analysis, Isomap) and decoding algorithms (system identification, neural networks, support vector machines) to both spikes and field potentials. Aim 2 will entail using a computer model and spatial spectral analysis to optimize the epidural electrode array design. This project will provide the first comparison of spikes, LFPs and EFPs as inputs for identical BMI output applications. The supervision of Drs. Lee Miller and W. Zev Rymer, with additional guidance from Drs. Simon Levine, Jonathan Wolpaw and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, will provide the principal investigator with expertise in recording and processing both spikes and field potentials for BMI applications using a variety of state-of-the- art techniques. A comprehensive career development plan including clinical and research mentoring, seminars, and courses, will foster the candidate's transition into an independent physician-scientist.           n/a",Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface,8091226,K08NS060223,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pontine structure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Visual', 'arm', 'brain machine interface', 'career development', 'computerized data processing', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'motor control', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'surgical technique development']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2011,167832,0.021381947935305005
"An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After the first four years of our Bioengineering Research Partnership, implantable devices for epilepsy are now a reality. This is due, in part, to translation of technology developed by our group to industry. Data from multi-center clinical trials of first generation responsive antiepileptic devices indicate that this new technology is safe, and that there is promise of significant benefit to patients. They also demonstrate that 1st-generation devices rarely make patients seizure free. This is because we do not yet understand when, where and how to deliver electrical stimulation to pre-empt seizures, or the mechanisms underlying seizure generation in epileptic networks. These challenges, and translating them into more effective second-generation devices, are the focus of this proposal. Specifically, our aims are: (1) To understand mechanisms underlying seizure generation in two well characterized, spontaneously seizing animal models of epilepsy with documented similarities to refractory human epilepsy, (2) To map seizure generation in the epileptic network to determine where to place sensing electrodes and when to stimulate to maximize seizure suppression and minimize side effects. (3) To develop more effective closed loop stimulation algorithms for controlling seizures. These Aims will be accomplished through a series of projects led by established collaborators in neurology, neuroscience, bioengineering and industry, at Penn, CHOP, Georgia Tech, and BioQuantix, Inc. Teams will focus on improving upon results from first-generation human devices through detailed animal experiments on multiple temporal and spatial scales. These include: (1) the cellular level, through broad-band unit recording and biophysically accurate computational modeling; (2) the network level, with in vitro experiments on hippocampal slices using voltage sensitive dyes and multi-electrode arrays; and (3) the whole brain level, through simultaneous micro and macroelectrode field recordings and responsive brain stimulation in vivo. These experiments will build upon the substantial progress made during the first cycle of our Bioengineering Research Partnership grant. The unique composition of our group, its track record of successful technology transfer, and our ability to learn from and immediately convey our discoveries to existing programmable devices, provide an unprecedented opportunity to perform cutting-edge neuroscience and bioengineering research and immediately translate it into better treatment for patients.           n/a",An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures,8059576,R01NS041811,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Dyes', 'Eels', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors', 'Methods', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent Model', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'experience', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'markov model', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'sensor', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2011,1244329,0.016733587600345223
"Fully Implantable and Programmable Spike-based Codecs for Neuroprosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment. Often the disability is so severe that it is not possible to feed oneself or readily communicate. A new class of medical system termed brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) has emerged from research labs in the past decade and is now poised to dramatically improve these patients' quality of life. BMIs ""read out"" neural electrical activity directly from motor structures in the brain and decode these electrical impulses in order to determine the intended movement. Initial versions of BMI systems that control a computer cursor are now in FDA Phase-I clinical trials, and numerous agencies are actively engaged in clinical translation (e.g., NIH, DARPA, VA). Creating control signals to enable an amputee to feed himself with a prosthetic (robotic) arm and hand will require decoding signals from thousands of electrodes, rather than the hundred or so signals current systems read, as well as encoding thousands of sensor signals from the arm and hand into thousands of artificial neural signals to be ""written into"" the brain, which has not yet been attempted. The lack of low-power (so that it can be implanted) electronic circuitry needed to run BMIs' encoding and decoding algorithms (termed codecs) is a fundamental barrier to successful clinical translation. The technologies available until now are too power-hungry (digital) or too algorithmically inflexible (analog) to meet the challenge. Recent advances in neuromorphic engineering make it now possible to build a fully implantable and programmable codec chip. This innovative approach combines digital's and analog's best features-programmability and efficiency-while offering far greater robustness than either. Meanwhile recent advances in neuroscience techniques make it now possible to obtain the knowledge needed to design the right algorithms to run on our codec chip. Optogenetic stimulaton can now be used to drive neurons in macaque cortex and computer vision can now be used to track freely moving monkeys while recording wirelessly. We propose to leverage these recent advances to dramatically increase prosthetic performance through the principled design of: (1) An entirely new class of encoders that can spatio-temporally pattern neural activity via optogenetic techniques. (2) An entirely new class of decoders that can operate in the real world with animals moving freely around in far less constrained settings. (3) An entirely new class of implantable programmable electronics that achieves the level of energy- efficiency required to run these complex algorithms. We will demonstrate our success by having a freely moving primate, with a 96-microelectrode recording array and a 9-channel optogenetic stimulator implanted in its premotor and somatosensory cortex, respectively, control a human-like robotic arm. Our ultimate goal is to realize the neuromorphic engineer's dream: Helping untold millions with neurological injury by replacing damaged neural tissue with chips that work like the brain.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological injury and disease resulting in profound movement impairment.

"Object Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What does it mean to know something about the world? Central to any theory of knowledge is a theory of concepts, those mental representations that allow us to categorize information in the world. In this project, we attempt to understand concepts by studying their neural instantiation. The central aim of this project is to advance our understanding of the neural representation of concepts via a characterization of similarity. The broader goal of this research program is to develop a strategy for understanding the neural representation of all types of knowledge; however, to make this problem more tractable, we are focusing on a specific type of concept - concrete objects - and on a particular type of knowledge about those concepts - their visual appearance. Specifically, (1) We aim to describe the neural representation of object concepts by characterizing neural tuning to features in a multidimensional similarity space; (2) We aim to examine variation in the neural representations of object concepts, across concepts, across individuals, and across attentional states; (3) We aim to explore to role of sleep-dependent consolidation processes in the acquisition of new object concept knowledge; (4) We aim to develop innovative methods for the characterization of neural similarity more generally.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Without concepts, we would be unable to make sense of the infinite variation in the world. Concepts organize our experiences, and they alter perception, memory, language, and action. The goal of this project is to understand the way in which conceptual knowledge is organized and the manner in which it is implemented in the brain. We will apply innovative neuroscientific methods to discover how we learn about the objects around us and how we access that information when remembering those objects.           Without concepts, we would be unable to make sense of the infinite variation in the world.

"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7761665,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'addiction', 'adverse outcome', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2010,214701,-0.012787157857065759
"The Neural Bases of he Semantic Structure of Words and Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to discover the neural representation of some simple words and concepts. It uses newly developed machine learning techniques and dimension reduction methods applied to fMRI brain activation data that will be acquired in new experimental paradigms. This research approach has for the first time succeeded in identifying the content of individual human thoughts based on the pattern of brain activity. The initial published studies have demonstrated this capability in the case of concrete nouns and physical objects. This project proposes to expand the approach to a much larger set of different types of concepts and to examine the effect of the way the concept is presented (e.g. a written or spoken word, or a picture). The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of how neural representations of meaning arise from the various brain systems that are used in interacting or considering the concept. An important secondary goal is to determine the degree of commonality of the neural representations across people.  The studies propose to examine the neural dimensions of meaning in three domains: (a) physical objects; (b) human traits, emotions, and interpersonal interactions; and (c) small numerical quantities. This set of semantic domains is expected to provide sufficient breadth to reveal some of the principle neural bases of semantic representation.  In contrast to the field of ""semantics"" (the study of the relation between words and their meanings), this project will help establish a new research area, neurosemantics, which is the study of the relation between words, thoughts, and their neural representations. The key assumption is that the underlying dimensions of meaning representation in the human brain are derived from basic neural systems. For example, one of the dimensions of representation of a physical object is how one physically interacts with or handles it. This dimension of representation is underpinned by a network of cortical areas that co-activate when one thinks about a physical object, and also when one actually handles the physical object. Other dimensions of neural representation similarly emerge when the concept is encountered. The studies will collectively identify the major dimensions of concept representation and relate them to networks of co-activating brain areas.  The cumulative knowledge from the completed project will provide the framework of a theory of how brain systems map onto the representation of the meaning of concepts. The theory will be applicable to understanding and designing therapies for neurological conditions in which the meanings of concepts are distorted, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and autism. The resulting theory will be foundational in relating the representation of meaning to brain function.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy. More generally, as a recent review (Bray et al., 2009) indicates, the new approach provides a good match to the brain characteristics of several brain disorders, and it is beginning to be applied for health-related purposes in many domains.              PROJECT NARRATIVE - RELEVANCE  The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7798636,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease diagnosis', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2010,35821,-0.001539139787871457
"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program. The proposed BRP will be lead by Drs. De Luca, Roy, and Adam, key personnel from Boston University (BU) with expertise in biomedical engineering and EMG system development. Signal processing/software development will be provided by the leadership from Dr. Nawab through BU's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

"CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intellectual Merit: There is compelling evidence that the distinct stages of sleep play an essential role in the long-term consolidation of memories (Marshall & Born 2007). Specifically, slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is hallmarked by slow oscillatory activity (< 1 Hz) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG), has been implicated in memory consolidation. We demonstrated that weak electric currents (<1mA, <1Hz and DC) applied to the scalp during SWS modulate these endogenous EEG rhythms and can improve human memory performance (Marshall 2006a). Moreover, application of the same weak currents during learning modulates ongoing EEG rhythms that are typical for the awake state in humans and boosts immediate performance in some learning tasks (Kirov 2009). Yet, despite these remarkable phenomenological findings, the question of how weak currents can modulate brain oscillations and induce plastic changes in brain function remains fundamentally unaddressed. Here we propose to quantitatively address this question through the development of computational models that are tightly constrained by specialized brain-slice experiments and validated through targeted human subject experiments. A central question is: how can weak electric currents, that appear insufficient to modulate excitability or plasticity in quiescent neurons, exert such a powerful effect on oscillations and learning? Our central hypothesis is that weak currents couple into ongoing slow oscillatory activity that then boost their modulatory effect on synaptic plasticity. Preliminary data from our group and others already provides strong evidence for modulation of endogenous rhythmic network activity by applied currents - at intensities considered too weak to affect single neuron function. Concurrently, we and other groups have investigated links between slow wave activity and memory consolidation, including by application of weak currents in human. But a specific connection between the effects of applied weak currents on slow-wave rhythms and plasticity has so far not been explored. Guided by computational models, the crucial empirical link between the two will be sought by probing lasting changes resulting from weak-current stimulation of an in vitro cortical preparation that exhibits SWA. Targeted human experiments will directly test if applied currents also enhance the consolidation of other SWS-mediated learning as the hypothesis would suggest, or rather, if the effect is limited to hippocampus-related learning, thus providing significant constraints to the computational models.    Broader Impacts: Weak applied currents are being explored in a number of empirical studies for their potential benefits to treat depression and neuropathic pain, to assist motor learning after stroke, or more generally, to enhance cognitive performance and to improve learning. The promise of this technique is that weak currents can be applied non-invasively with a potentially broad range of applications and minimal side effects. The enigma in this potentially transformative clinical tool, however, is that the electric field strengths generated by these currents in most studies are two orders of magnitude below what is required to activate an otherwise silent neuron. Currently, research in this area is almost entirely phenomenological and the few mechanistic explanations for the promising phenomenological observations are superficial (e.g. describing all brain function as a ""sliding scale of excitability"") and do not address plasticity - as such, there is no rational basis for improving and targeting stimulation protocols. This work is the first attempt at establishing the mechanistic link between applied currents on endogenous rhythms and the associated SWS-related learning enhancements. Evidently, such an analysis will address basic science questions about the link between endogenous SWS and learning, add to the set of experimental tools which can be used to study cognition, and, shed light on the functional and causal role of the ubiquitous endogenous rhythms generated by the brain.    Consistent with present call for US/German Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience this project will combined the expertise of international researchers in the areas of: (1) effects of noninvasive electrical stimulation on nervous tissue (Bikson, US), EEG signal analysis and computational network models (Parra, US), human sleep and learning with applied currents (Marshall, Germany), and dynamical systems and machine learning (Claussen/Martinetz, Germany; Parra, US).           n/a",CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep,8055164,R01MH092926,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Chemosensitization', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Models', 'Frequencies', 'German population', 'Germany', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'International', 'Ion Channel', 'Kale - dietary', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'density', 'electric field', 'human subject', 'imprint', 'improved', 'memory trace reactivation', 'motor learning', 'neocortical', 'painful neuropathy', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIMH,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2010,125618,-0.004998864613560955
"Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans Our overarching goal is to establish an animal model of freely moving humans. We choose to do so in order to directly measure the context-dependency of motor cortical activity and, ultimately, other activity reliant upon free movement such as social interaction among animals. Achieving this major technological challenge requires a complete system that includes (Specific Aim 1) wireless transmission of neural data from electrode arrays chronically implanted in monkeys, (Specific Aim 2) computer-vision algorithms to automatically extract body and limb orientation during free movement, and (Specific Aim 3) new mathematical and computational models to represent and extract information from high-dimensional neural and behavioral activity. This technology will enable an animal model of freely moving humans that will advance the development of cortical neural prostheses by providing models of the context-dependant nature of motor cortical control.  Unlike traditional laboratory environments used to study animal movement, human amputees and tetraplegics operate in a variety of contexts that involve their movement in the world. Understanding the motor control of complex movement in these natural settings is absolutely critical for future advances in cortically- controlled prostheses. Given our overarching goal, our hypothesis is that motor cortical activity (e.g., directional tuning curves, absolute firing rates, correlations among units, etc.) will be different in important ways when rhesus monkeys perform the same reaching arm movements in an un-constrained context (e.g., not sitting quietly, not head restrained, not in dark and quiet room, etc.) as in a traditional, highly constrained context. Our three Specific Aims will put in place the electronic, computational and mathematical technology necessary to address this hypothesis, and also to make such studies of free behavior in rhesus monkeys possible. The innovative integration of neural engineering, neuroscience, computer vision, mathematics and neural modeling will provide new tools to enable the unprecedented study of motor control during natural, unconstrained behavior.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research project is directly relevant to both basic neuroscience studies of higher brain function and to neural prosthesis research aimed at, ultimately, helping patients with motor disorders. We will conduct neurophysiological and behavioral experiments with rhesus monkeys in two different contexts - ""in home cage"" and ""in rig"" - to investigate the context dependence of motor cortical activity. With this knowledge, we will then design ""context independent"" models of the neural-behavioral relationship which we, and other researchers, could then use in neural prosthetic experiments while monkeys freely move around their less- constrained home cages.",Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans,7883275,R01NS066311,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Social Interaction', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Technology', 'Wireless Technology', 'arm', 'design', 'free behavior', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neural model', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,303756,0.0014913146191939035
"Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  fMRI experiments produce large, numerically rich, but noisy data sets that pose a challenge for extracting the signal variance and establishing the correspondence between that signal and cognitive variables.  Conventional analysis has reduced the dimensionality of fMRI data by searching for clusters of voxels that show similar responses to experimental manipulations and averaging the signal within those clusters.  We have introduced a new approach to fMRI data analysis, ""multi-voxel pattern analysis"", that examines higher spatial frequency patterns of activity - the voxel-by-voxel variation of response within a region - and have shown that this method greatly increases the sensitivity of fMRI (Haxby et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2004; OToole et al. 2004; Polyn et al. 2004).  In the proposed investigations, we will develop new methods for analysis of spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity in relation to two specific problems in fMRI data analysis:  1.  accounting for inter-individual variation in functional neuroanatomy, and 2.  the relation between spatially-distributed neural population responses and cognitive representations.  This work will involve the efforts of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cognitive neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, and signal- processing engineers.  We propose the development of analytic methods for aligning the functional neuroanatomy of individual brains based on the patterns of neural activity that are elicited by a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.  We predict that these methods will enhance the sensitivity of group statistical tests of fMRI data, will allow the investigation of the inter-individual consistency of higher spatial frequency topographic representations, and will provide explicit measures of inter-individual variation in the location, organization, and spatial extent of functional maps, with potential applications for studies of clinical conditions.  We propose, further, to develop methods for detecting and analyzing distributed patterns of neural activity that make use of prior knowledge about the structure of the cognitive representations that are associated with those neural activities.  We predict that these methods will increase the sensitivity of multi-voxel pattern analysis and will allow the investigation of how cognitive information is represented in topographically-organized, spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity.         n/a",Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data,7846781,R01MH075706,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Engineering', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Normal Range', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural patterning', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2010,317364,0.005121421854123679
"CRCNS: fMRI Pattern Analysis of Neural Correlates of Natural Scene Categories    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For over half a century, vision scientists have been decomposing visual scenes into simple, more tractable components in an attempt to understand how the brain accomplishes vision. Although this endeavor has revealed much about the specialized subsystems of vision, surprisingly little is know about how, or even where in the brain, we process scenes as a whole. How is it, for instance, that the brain determines whether it is looking at a forest or a city skyline? One reason for the paucity of research on this topic may be that the neural representation of a scene is likely to be highly distributed, a coding scheme not easily identified by many traditional neuroscience methods. The objective of the proposed research is to use a new method of analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that is designed to leverage activity patterns across the brain, in order to better understand how the brain categorizes natural scenes. In particular, the project combines expertise from computer vision and neuroimaging by applying statistical pattern recognition algorithms to fMRI data to understand how the brain distinguishes between different categories of natural scene (e.g., a beach versus a highway). The proposed project will use and develop a statistical pattern recognition approach to fMRI analysis to accomplish three more specific objectives: (i) to identify the neural representation of natural scene categories, (ii) to identify the computational principles for forming and using the neural representation of natural scene categories, and (iii) to explore the effects of attention and expectation on natural scene categorization. The insights gained from these experiments will be verified in a computational model of natural scene perception, which in turn will generate predictions for future experiments. Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: Although previous research has shown that humans can quickly and effortless categorize natural scenes, there is very little understanding of how this is accomplished in the brain. The research proposed here will significantly advance our understanding of how natural scenes are represented in the brain and begin to uncover the computational strategies the brain employs in quickly and accurately extracting the gist of a scene. Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity: The highly interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research requires intense interactions among psychologists, neuroscientists, and computer vision researchers. As such, the project not only promises to increase communication among very different disciplines but it will also to provide doctoral students with truly interdisciplinary training. The PIs are committed to providing a highly interactive research environment, mentoring students across disciplines, and fostering the interdisciplinary approach to science in general. Moreover, two of the three PIs are women working in fields in which women are traditionally underrepresented and are committed to improving the representation and visibility of women in science. Finally, the principles derived from this project are likely to have implications beyond the domain of natural scene perception. By refining the pattern recognition algorithms and their application to fMRI data, the project will expand the set of tools available to neuroscientists wishing to study a whole host of complex human behaviors that likely depend on subtle but distributed patterns of activity in the brain.           n/a",CRCNS: fMRI Pattern Analysis of Neural Correlates of Natural Scene Categories,7903878,R01EY019429,"['Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perception', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'design', 'expectation', 'forest', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'vision science', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,329525,-0.007690324681261831
"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories. These waves exhibit spatial patterns that may help guide the proper function of the hippocampus.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics.

"A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of advanced neuroprosthetic systems and brain-machine interfaces for high-capacity, real-time, bi-directional communication with the nervous system is a major challenge to the emerging neural engineering discipline.  While recent advances in the fabrication of high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs) for multiunit recording and stimulation have triggered numerous neurobiological discoveries, the resulting large data throughput and the variability of cortical responses over repeated trials preclude the ability to design a wireless, adaptive, fully implantable large-scale interface to the cortex.  This severely limits the feasibility and space of experimental paradigms needed to improve our understanding of the nervous system functionality and characterize cortical responses in freely behaving subjects interacting naturally with their surroundings.  The objective of this project is to develop a wireless interface to the cortex capable of processing simultaneously recorded neural signalsfrom 64 electrode channels in real time.  The project has 3 aims:  1.  Develop advanced signal processing algorithms for sensing and decoding neuronal response properties from distributed intra-cortical neural activity:  1) Optimize our existing signal processing algorithms for hardware implementation to extract the desired neural activity early in the data stream; 2) Develop new algorithms for decoding these responses to characterize the natural behavior of awake, behaving animal models.  2.  Design low-power integrated circuits and wireless telemetry for a 64 channel system:  1) Optimize the design of a low power Neural Interface Node (NIN) module to feature wireless communication and powering capability for subcutaneous implantation; 2) Design and fabricate an extracranial Manager Interface Module (MIM) to permit:  a) wireless powering and data exchange with up to 2 implanted NIN modules; b) wireless bidirectional exchange of data and control with a central base station.  3.  Demonstrate the system functionality in vitro and vivo:  1) Build a 32 channel system and test its performance in vitro in retinal slices and in vivo in awake behaving rodents; 2) Demonstrate the real time functionality of a 64 channel system in vitro and explore its feasibility in vivo; 3) Optimize the entire system design, and benchmark it against a commercial 64 channel wired data acquisition system.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project seeks to develop a wireless electronic microsystem to be implanted in the rat brain to continuously monitor neural signals when the rat is freely behaving in an open environment.  This system will help understand how brain cells process information.  This will help design assistive technology for people with severe paralysis.       n/a",A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex,7903986,R01NS062031,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cavia', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Microelectrodes', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'System', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'awake', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain machine interface', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data exchange', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'implantation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'microsystems', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'operation', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'quantum', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'subcutaneous', 'tool']",NINDS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,511198,0.005080015172781524
"An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After the first four years of our Bioengineering Research Partnership, implantable devices for epilepsy are now a reality. This is due, in part, to translation of technology developed by our group to industry. Data from multi-center clinical trials of first generation responsive antiepileptic devices indicate that this new technology is safe, and that there is promise of significant benefit to patients. They also demonstrate that 1st-generation devices rarely make patients seizure free. This is because we do not yet understand when, where and how to deliver electrical stimulation to pre-empt seizures, or the mechanisms underlying seizure generation in epileptic networks. These challenges, and translating them into more effective second-generation devices, are the focus of this proposal. Specifically, our aims are: (1) To understand mechanisms underlying seizure generation in two well characterized, spontaneously seizing animal models of epilepsy with documented similarities to refractory human epilepsy, (2) To map seizure generation in the epileptic network to determine where to place sensing electrodes and when to stimulate to maximize seizure suppression and minimize side effects. (3) To develop more effective closed loop stimulation algorithms for controlling seizures. These Aims will be accomplished through a series of projects led by established collaborators in neurology, neuroscience, bioengineering and industry, at Penn, CHOP, Georgia Tech, and BioQuantix, Inc. Teams will focus on improving upon results from first-generation human devices through detailed animal experiments on multiple temporal and spatial scales. These include: (1) the cellular level, through broad-band unit recording and biophysically accurate computational modeling; (2) the network level, with in vitro experiments on hippocampal slices using voltage sensitive dyes and multi-electrode arrays; and (3) the whole brain level, through simultaneous micro and macroelectrode field recordings and responsive brain stimulation in vivo. These experiments will build upon the substantial progress made during the first cycle of our Bioengineering Research Partnership grant. The unique composition of our group, its track record of successful technology transfer, and our ability to learn from and immediately convey our discoveries to existing programmable devices, provide an unprecedented opportunity to perform cutting-edge neuroscience and bioengineering research and immediately translate it into better treatment for patients.           n/a",An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures,7808779,R01NS041811,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Dyes', 'Eels', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors', 'Methods', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent Model', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'markov model', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'sensor', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2010,1249881,0.016733587600345223
"Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Over 600,000 Americans have severely impaired motor function from disorders including spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontine stroke, and cerebral palsy. A brain-machine interface (BMI) could enable locked-in or tetraplegic patients to communicate and interact with their environment. Two crucial decisions in designing a BMI are (1) what type of brain signals to use as inputs to a controller and (2) what methods to use to decode those signals. Most BMIs have used either noninvasive scalp EEG recordings or invasive intracortical recordings of single- or multi-neuron spikes as control inputs. A few have used subdural or intracortical local field potentials (LFPs). However, no group has yet systematically compared these signals in motor cortex for use in BMI applications. This proposal's first goal is to assess the relative performance of spikes and field potentials (both intracortical and epidural) as control inputs for a variety of movement-related outputs. Epidural field potentials (EFPs) are intermediate in invasiveness, signal quality, stability and spatial resolution compared with existing scalp, subdural, and intracortical recordings, and thus represent an unexplored middle ground. This proposal's second goal is to evaluate linear and nonlinear techniques-including several novel to BMI applications-for both decoding data and reducing the inherently large dimensionality of data from multiple neural signals. The primary hypotheses of the proposed project are (1) that spikes will perform better in decoding more complex movement-related outputs, but that field potentials may perform similarly on decoding simpler outputs, and (2) that nonlinear decoders and dimensionality-reduction techniques may provide improved accuracy over linear methods. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are 1) to evaluate single neuron spikes as inputs to decoders of movement- related outputs, 2) to develop a novel epidural multi-electrode recording technique in the macaque monkey, and 3) to evaluate field potential signals as inputs to decoders of movement-related outputs. Aims 1 and 3 will involve application of dimensionality-reduction algorithms (e.g., independent components analysis, Isomap) and decoding algorithms (system identification, neural networks, support vector machines) to both spikes and field potentials. Aim 2 will entail using a computer model and spatial spectral analysis to optimize the epidural electrode array design. This project will provide the first comparison of spikes, LFPs and EFPs as inputs for identical BMI output applications. The supervision of Drs. Lee Miller and W. Zev Rymer, with additional guidance from Drs. Simon Levine, Jonathan Wolpaw and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, will provide the principal investigator with expertise in recording and processing both spikes and field potentials for BMI applications using a variety of state-of-the- art techniques. A comprehensive career development plan including clinical and research mentoring, seminars, and courses, will foster the candidate's transition into an independent physician-scientist.           n/a",Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface,7876844,K08NS060223,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Arts', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pontine structure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Visual', 'arm', 'brain machine interface', 'career development', 'computerized data processing', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'motor control', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'surgical technique development']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2010,167832,0.021381947935305005
"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7599700,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'addiction', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2009,216795,-0.012787157857065759
"Causal Perceptual Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to make original contributions to scientific understanding of biological perception. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a causal model of touch sensations' integration with visual sensations for perception, and to generalize this model for application to a broader class of sensory integration phenomena, 2) apply causal models to investigate how humans perceive cause-and-effect events, 3) increase the applicant's technical proficiency with causal modeling and applied machine learning methods. The proposal includes two main projects; the first will measure how humans judge the size of objects when their distances are uncertain. Specifically the first project examines the theory that human perception uses knowledge about how size and distance sensations are caused to integrate related sensations. Human experimental participants will view objects while touching them and report their perceptions of the objects' sizes, which will be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. The second project investigates how humans perceive cause-and-effect chains of events by examining the theory that the brain uses built-in knowledge of rudimentary physical behaviors, like momentum in collisions, to interpret such simple events. Human experimental participants will view colliding objects and report what occurred, which will again be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this research is to increase scientific and medical understanding of the neural communication and processing strategies the brain employs to create perceptual experiences, so that people with perceptual impairments can be provided with effective rehabilitation programs and biotechnological substitutes for diminished capabilities. Specific impairments include blindness and low-vision, traumatic brain and nervous system injuries, and strokes.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7616408,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease diagnosis', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2009,35821,-0.001539139787871457
"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology. On its successful completion, based on specific milestones, we will move to the more applied work with human subjects.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. We are interested specifically in states and markers of impulsivity and cigarette craving. Our goal ultimately is to have a tool that can be used in the context of neurofeedback, allowing human subject or patient to receive an indication of activity in their brains associated with these states and to enable them to learn to control these cognitive/affective states by controlling the brain activity.           Project Narrative Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography.

"Experimental and Computational Studies of Concept Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is aimed at developing better understanding of how people bring their prior knowledge to the table when learning about new concepts. Both experimental studies and computational models of these processes will be used to further understanding of this fundamental aspect of human cognition. The proposal focuses on effects and interactions that show that memorized exemplars of a problem are involved with concept learning, on processes involved in unsupervised sorting without feedback, and on how these two processes interact with pre-existing concepts and relational knowledge. New computational models will incorporate exemplars and unsupervised learning into an existing model of knowledge and supervised learning, accounting for a variety of previously observed and newly predicted effects. Experiments involving human participants will investigate interactions of prior knowledge with frequency, exposure, and concept structure. Experiments are paired with the modeling so that new empirical discoveries will go hand-in-hand with theoretical development. If successful, this model will be the only one in the field that accounts for this range of phenomena, encompassing both statistical learning and use of prior knowledge in concept acquisition. Relevance to Public Health: Categorization and category learning are fundamental aspects of cognition, allowing people to intelligently respond to the world.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program. The proposed BRP will be lead by Drs. De Luca, Roy, and Adam, key personnel from Boston University (BU) with expertise in biomedical engineering and EMG system development. Signal processing/software development will be provided by the leadership from Dr. Nawab through BU's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

"Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and related electroencephalography (EEG) use an array of sensors to non-invasively measure electromagnetic (EM) fields produced by synchronous current activity within the brain. While the temporal resolution is excellent relative to other functional imaging modalities, accurately localizing in 3D space the sources of brain activity involves solving a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. Existing localization methods used clinically and for research purposes maintain significant shortcomings, including the inability to resolve complex source configurations, bias caused by source correlations, and sensitivity to sources of noise and interference. The latter can arise from eye blinks, heart beats, sensor imperfections, and industrial noise as well as from spontaneous background brain activity not associated with the brain sources of interest. Additionally, prototype algorithms ostensibly designed to deal with some of these issues are heuristic in nature and have not been rigorously evaluated or compared, making their ultimate utility difficult to assess for neuroelectromagnetic imaging practitioners. The proposed research plan addresses all of these concerns by developing a principled localization scheme that unifies and extends existing localization strategies using modern concepts from Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Based on the notion of automatic relevance determination (ARD), brain regions with probable (relevant) activity are located with high spatial resolution. Interference sources are effectively removed by integrating with a variation factor analysis model. To quantify the improvement afforded by the proposed methodology, source location estimates will be compared with standard algorithms using realistic simulations, near-ground-truth data obtained from invasive electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings, and surgical data. The result will be implemented as a user-friendly localization toolbox and made freely available to the community by integrating with existing open-source functional brain imaging software. Non-invasive mapping of brain activity with high spatio-temporal resolution has important consequences for basic neuroscience studies of human cognition. It also has profound implications for the diagnosis, characterization and treatment of various neurological, neurooncological, mental health, developmental, and communication disorders. For example, localizations of brain sources are used to map cognitive function in epileptogenic areas and in neighboring brain regions. Such brain mapping procedures are then useful to guide neurosurgical planning, navigation, and resection and to minimize post-operative deficits.           n/a",Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones,7751495,F32NS061395,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Electromagnetics', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nutmeg - dietary', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic pedigree', 'heuristics', 'human CYP2B6 protein', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2009,46257,-0.010616624215900915
"Sequence Induction in Infancy: A systematic approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thirteen experiments investigate the early development of the ability to learn patterns in sequential input. Such evidence would seem likely to provide a substantial contribution to our knowledge of how infants identify both concrete and abstract patterns, a fundamental aspect of cognitive development. The proposed experiments are organized into three broad studies. In the first study, we will examine ""ancillary"" factors that may influence sequence learning in infancy. We emphasize the importance of two kinds of relations between elements in any multi-element group or string: itemwise relations, between specific instances (e.g., statistical learning), and variablewise relations, between algebraic placeholders (e.g., abstract pattern or rule learning). We argue that a first step toward any programmatic series of experiments on these kinds of learning-must involve an understanding of processing limitations that may constrain performance. In the second study, we will investigate the different kinds of patterns infants may be able to learn, using past and pilot data as a guide for our theorizing. In the final study, we will explore the intriguing possibility that infants may learn more than one pattern in any single set of inputs, a classic question that has received little empirical attention in the literature on cognitive development. The short-term objectives of the present proposal are to elucidate fundamental developmental mechanisms in the ability to detect abstract visual and auditory structure. The long-term goals are to shed light on the larger question of how knowledge is acquired and structured in the human, how perceptual skills impact knowledge acquisition and structure, and how to best characterize early development. In the future, such understanding may aid in the formulation of diagnostics and treatments for some developmental disorders.           n/a",Sequence Induction in Infancy: A systematic approach,7684605,R01HD048733,"['Address', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Be++ element', 'Beds', 'Beryllium', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conceptual Domain', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Formulations', 'Elements', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vegetables', 'Visual', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'coping', 'developmental disease', 'infancy', 'neglect', 'object perception', 'postnatal', 'research study', 'sequence learning', 'skills']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2009,237807,-0.02723645597116663
"Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans Our overarching goal is to establish an animal model of freely moving humans. We choose to do so in order to directly measure the context-dependency of motor cortical activity and, ultimately, other activity reliant upon free movement such as social interaction among animals. Achieving this major technological challenge requires a complete system that includes (Specific Aim 1) wireless transmission of neural data from electrode arrays chronically implanted in monkeys, (Specific Aim 2) computer-vision algorithms to automatically extract body and limb orientation during free movement, and (Specific Aim 3) new mathematical and computational models to represent and extract information from high-dimensional neural and behavioral activity. This technology will enable an animal model of freely moving humans that will advance the development of cortical neural prostheses by providing models of the context-dependant nature of motor cortical control.  Unlike traditional laboratory environments used to study animal movement, human amputees and tetraplegics operate in a variety of contexts that involve their movement in the world. Understanding the motor control of complex movement in these natural settings is absolutely critical for future advances in cortically- controlled prostheses. Given our overarching goal, our hypothesis is that motor cortical activity (e.g., directional tuning curves, absolute firing rates, correlations among units, etc.) will be different in important ways when rhesus monkeys perform the same reaching arm movements in an un-constrained context (e.g., not sitting quietly, not head restrained, not in dark and quiet room, etc.) as in a traditional, highly constrained context. Our three Specific Aims will put in place the electronic, computational and mathematical technology necessary to address this hypothesis, and also to make such studies of free behavior in rhesus monkeys possible. The innovative integration of neural engineering, neuroscience, computer vision, mathematics and neural modeling will provide new tools to enable the unprecedented study of motor control during natural, unconstrained behavior.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research project is directly relevant to both basic neuroscience studies of higher brain function and to neural prosthesis research aimed at, ultimately, helping patients with motor disorders. We will conduct neurophysiological and behavioral experiments with rhesus monkeys in two different contexts - ""in home cage"" and ""in rig"" - to investigate the context dependence of motor cortical activity. With this knowledge, we will then design ""context independent"" models of the neural-behavioral relationship which we, and other researchers, could then use in neural prosthetic experiments while monkeys freely move around their less- constrained home cages.",Toward an Animal Model of Freely Moving Humans,7725788,R01NS066311,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Social Interaction', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Technology', 'Upper arm', 'Wireless Technology', 'design', 'free behavior', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neural model', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,366873,0.0014913146191939035
"Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  fMRI experiments produce large, numerically rich, but noisy data sets that pose a challenge for extracting the signal variance and establishing the correspondence between that signal and cognitive variables.  Conventional analysis has reduced the dimensionality of fMRI data by searching for clusters of voxels that show similar responses to experimental manipulations and averaging the signal within those clusters.  We have introduced a new approach to fMRI data analysis, ""multi-voxel pattern analysis"", that examines higher spatial frequency patterns of activity - the voxel-by-voxel variation of response within a region - and have shown that this method greatly increases the sensitivity of fMRI (Haxby et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2004; OToole et al. 2004; Polyn et al. 2004).  In the proposed investigations, we will develop new methods for analysis of spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity in relation to two specific problems in fMRI data analysis:  1.  accounting for inter-individual variation in functional neuroanatomy, and 2.  the relation between spatially-distributed neural population responses and cognitive representations.  This work will involve the efforts of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cognitive neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, and signal- processing engineers.  We propose the development of analytic methods for aligning the functional neuroanatomy of individual brains based on the patterns of neural activity that are elicited by a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.  We predict that these methods will enhance the sensitivity of group statistical tests of fMRI data, will allow the investigation of the inter-individual consistency of higher spatial frequency topographic representations, and will provide explicit measures of inter-individual variation in the location, organization, and spatial extent of functional maps, with potential applications for studies of clinical conditions.  We propose, further, to develop methods for detecting and analyzing distributed patterns of neural activity that make use of prior knowledge about the structure of the cognitive representations that are associated with those neural activities.  We predict that these methods will increase the sensitivity of multi-voxel pattern analysis and will allow the investigation of how cognitive information is represented in topographically-organized, spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity.         n/a",Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data,7692174,R01MH075706,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Engineering', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Normal Range', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural patterning', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2009,318428,0.005121421854123679
"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results. A dissemination plan is included to make this technology available to the Motor Control community. Commercialization will be realized through Altec Inc. This technology will enable researchers in the fields of Motor Control, Aging, Exercise Physiology, Space Medicine, and Ergonomics, where it is of interest to understand how the CNS controls muscles, and how that control is altered as a consequence of aging, exercise, exposure to microgravity, fatigue, and excessive and prolonged force production.

"CRCNS: fMRI Pattern Analysis of Neural Correlates of Natural Scene Categories    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For over half a century, vision scientists have been decomposing visual scenes into simple, more tractable components in an attempt to understand how the brain accomplishes vision. Although this endeavor has revealed much about the specialized subsystems of vision, surprisingly little is know about how, or even where in the brain, we process scenes as a whole. How is it, for instance, that the brain determines whether it is looking at a forest or a city skyline? One reason for the paucity of research on this topic may be that the neural representation of a scene is likely to be highly distributed, a coding scheme not easily identified by many traditional neuroscience methods. The objective of the proposed research is to use a new method of analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that is designed to leverage activity patterns across the brain, in order to better understand how the brain categorizes natural scenes. In particular, the project combines expertise from computer vision and neuroimaging by applying statistical pattern recognition algorithms to fMRI data to understand how the brain distinguishes between different categories of natural scene (e.g., a beach versus a highway). The proposed project will use and develop a statistical pattern recognition approach to fMRI analysis to accomplish three more specific objectives: (i) to identify the neural representation of natural scene categories, (ii) to identify the computational principles for forming and using the neural representation of natural scene categories, and (iii) to explore the effects of attention and expectation on natural scene categorization. The insights gained from these experiments will be verified in a computational model of natural scene perception, which in turn will generate predictions for future experiments. Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: Although previous research has shown that humans can quickly and effortless categorize natural scenes, there is very little understanding of how this is accomplished in the brain. The research proposed here will significantly advance our understanding of how natural scenes are represented in the brain and begin to uncover the computational strategies the brain employs in quickly and accurately extracting the gist of a scene.

"A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of advanced neuroprosthetic systems and brain-machine interfaces for high-capacity, real-time, bi-directional communication with the nervous system is a major challenge to the emerging neural engineering discipline.  While recent advances in the fabrication of high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs) for multiunit recording and stimulation have triggered numerous neurobiological discoveries, the resulting large data throughput and the variability of cortical responses over repeated trials preclude the ability to design a wireless, adaptive, fully implantable large-scale interface to the cortex.  This severely limits the feasibility and space of experimental paradigms needed to improve our understanding of the nervous system functionality and characterize cortical responses in freely behaving subjects interacting naturally with their surroundings.  The objective of this project is to develop a wireless interface to the cortex capable of processing simultaneously recorded neural signalsfrom 64 electrode channels in real time.  The project has 3 aims:  1.  Develop advanced signal processing algorithms for sensing and decoding neuronal response properties from distributed intra-cortical neural activity:  1) Optimize our existing signal processing algorithms for hardware implementation to extract the desired neural activity early in the data stream; 2) Develop new algorithms for decoding these responses to characterize the natural behavior of awake, behaving animal models.  2.  Design low-power integrated circuits and wireless telemetry for a 64 channel system:  1) Optimize the design of a low power Neural Interface Node (NIN) module to feature wireless communication and powering capability for subcutaneous implantation; 2) Design and fabricate an extracranial Manager Interface Module (MIM) to permit:  a) wireless powering and data exchange with up to 2 implanted NIN modules; b) wireless bidirectional exchange of data and control with a central base station.  3.  Demonstrate the system functionality in vitro and vivo:  1) Build a 32 channel system and test its performance in vitro in retinal slices and in vivo in awake behaving rodents; 2) Demonstrate the real time functionality of a 64 channel system in vitro and explore its feasibility in vivo; 3) Optimize the entire system design, and benchmark it against a commercial 64 channel wired data acquisition system.

"An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After the first four years of our Bioengineering Research Partnership, implantable devices for epilepsy are now a reality. This is due, in part, to translation of technology developed by our group to industry. Data from multi-center clinical trials of first generation responsive antiepileptic devices indicate that this new technology is safe, and that there is promise of significant benefit to patients. They also demonstrate that 1st-generation devices rarely make patients seizure free. This is because we do not yet understand when, where and how to deliver electrical stimulation to pre-empt seizures, or the mechanisms underlying seizure generation in epileptic networks. These challenges, and translating them into more effective second-generation devices, are the focus of this proposal. Specifically, our aims are: (1) To understand mechanisms underlying seizure generation in two well characterized, spontaneously seizing animal models of epilepsy with documented similarities to refractory human epilepsy, (2) To map seizure generation in the epileptic network to determine where to place sensing electrodes and when to stimulate to maximize seizure suppression and minimize side effects. (3) To develop more effective closed loop stimulation algorithms for controlling seizures. These Aims will be accomplished through a series of projects led by established collaborators in neurology, neuroscience, bioengineering and industry, at Penn, CHOP, Georgia Tech, and BioQuantix, Inc. Teams will focus on improving upon results from first-generation human devices through detailed animal experiments on multiple temporal and spatial scales. These include: (1) the cellular level, through broad-band unit recording and biophysically accurate computational modeling; (2) the network level, with in vitro experiments on hippocampal slices using voltage sensitive dyes and multi-electrode arrays; and (3) the whole brain level, through simultaneous micro and macroelectrode field recordings and responsive brain stimulation in vivo. These experiments will build upon the substantial progress made during the first cycle of our Bioengineering Research Partnership grant. The unique composition of our group, its track record of successful technology transfer, and our ability to learn from and immediately convey our discoveries to existing programmable devices, provide an unprecedented opportunity to perform cutting-edge neuroscience and bioengineering research and immediately translate it into better treatment for patients.           n/a",An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures,7616844,R01NS041811,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Dyes', 'Eels', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors', 'Methods', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent Model', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'markov model', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'sensor', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2009,1255061,0.016733587600345223
"Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Over 600,000 Americans have severely impaired motor function from disorders including spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontine stroke, and cerebral palsy. A brain-machine interface (BMI) could enable locked-in or tetraplegic patients to communicate and interact with their environment. Two crucial decisions in designing a BMI are (1) what type of brain signals to use as inputs to a controller and (2) what methods to use to decode those signals. Most BMIs have used either noninvasive scalp EEG recordings or invasive intracortical recordings of single- or multi-neuron spikes as control inputs. A few have used subdural or intracortical local field potentials (LFPs). However, no group has yet systematically compared these signals in motor cortex for use in BMI applications. This proposal's first goal is to assess the relative performance of spikes and field potentials (both intracortical and epidural) as control inputs for a variety of movement-related outputs. Epidural field potentials (EFPs) are intermediate in invasiveness, signal quality, stability and spatial resolution compared with existing scalp, subdural, and intracortical recordings, and thus represent an unexplored middle ground. This proposal's second goal is to evaluate linear and nonlinear techniques-including several novel to BMI applications-for both decoding data and reducing the inherently large dimensionality of data from multiple neural signals. The primary hypotheses of the proposed project are (1) that spikes will perform better in decoding more complex movement-related outputs, but that field potentials may perform similarly on decoding simpler outputs, and (2) that nonlinear decoders and dimensionality-reduction techniques may provide improved accuracy over linear methods. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are 1) to evaluate single neuron spikes as inputs to decoders of movement- related outputs, 2) to develop a novel epidural multi-electrode recording technique in the macaque monkey, and 3) to evaluate field potential signals as inputs to decoders of movement-related outputs. Aims 1 and 3 will involve application of dimensionality-reduction algorithms (e.g., independent components analysis, Isomap) and decoding algorithms (system identification, neural networks, support vector machines) to both spikes and field potentials. Aim 2 will entail using a computer model and spatial spectral analysis to optimize the epidural electrode array design. This project will provide the first comparison of spikes, LFPs and EFPs as inputs for identical BMI output applications. The supervision of Drs. Lee Miller and W. Zev Rymer, with additional guidance from Drs. Simon Levine, Jonathan Wolpaw and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, will provide the principal investigator with expertise in recording and processing both spikes and field potentials for BMI applications using a variety of state-of-the- art techniques. A comprehensive career development plan including clinical and research mentoring, seminars, and courses, will foster the candidate's transition into an independent physician-scientist.           n/a",Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface,7643089,K08NS060223,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Arts', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pontine structure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Upper arm', 'Visual', 'brain machine interface', 'career development', 'computerized data processing', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'motor control', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'surgical technique development']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2009,167832,0.021381947935305005
"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7440338,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'addiction', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'human study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2008,216244,-0.012787157857065759
"Causal Perceptual Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to make original contributions to scientific understanding of biological perception. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a causal model of touch sensations' integration with visual sensations for perception, and to generalize this model for application to a broader class of sensory integration phenomena, 2) apply causal models to investigate how humans perceive cause-and-effect events, 3) increase the applicant's technical proficiency with causal modeling and applied machine learning methods. The proposal includes two main projects; the first will measure how humans judge the size of objects when their distances are uncertain. Specifically the first project examines the theory that human perception uses knowledge about how size and distance sensations are caused to integrate related sensations. Human experimental participants will view objects while touching them and report their perceptions of the objects' sizes, which will be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. The second project investigates how humans perceive cause-and-effect chains of events by examining the theory that the brain uses built-in knowledge of rudimentary physical behaviors, like momentum in collisions, to interpret such simple events. Human experimental participants will view colliding objects and report what occurred, which will again be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this research is to increase scientific and medical understanding of the neural communication and processing strategies the brain employs to create perceptual experiences, so that people with perceptual impairments can be provided with effective rehabilitation programs and biotechnological substitutes for diminished capabilities. Specific impairments include blindness and low-vision, traumatic brain and nervous system injuries, and strokes.

"Motor Learning for the Control of an Assistive Device The goal of these studies is to understand how movements of the body can be harnessed and trained to control electrically powered wheelchairs. Advanced wheelchair technology is often perceived to be a barrier by a large number of potential wheelchair users. An approach is proposed for the removal of this barrier based on adapting the assistive technology to the residual unconstrained mobility of the patients and on enhancing motor learning. This exploratory project aims at establishing the feasibility of such an approach and at developing training methods based on the identification of natural motions and on the use of virtual reality (VR). The proposed studies will be carried out on quadriplegic spinal cord injured patients with complete or incomplete cervical injuries. Healthy volunteers will also participate in these study to fine-tune the experimental apparatus and to provide a reference baseline to assess learning and coordination. Subjects will wear a novel upper-body sensing garment. A total of 52 electrical signals generated by the garment will be modulated by movements of the wrist, elbow, shoulder and torso. These signals will be mapped into the velocity commands for a simulated wheelchair. Subjects will wear VR-goggles and a head tracker, which will provide them with a immersive view of a computer-generated environment from the perspective of the simulated wheelchair. The combination of virtual reality environments and wearable signal technology will provide a framework for evaluating training protocols that would not be feasible with actual wheelchairs. The proposed studies are organized in two specific aims: (Aim 1.) To identify motor primitives for the control of a virtual wheelchair by unrestricted upper body motions Three well-established signal processing techniques - Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis and Isomap - will be used and compared for extracting low-dimensional signal patterns from the garment signals (Aim 2.) To identify maps and procedures that facilitate motor learning. The signal patterns extracted from Aim 1 will be used to design and test new transformations from subject motions to wheelchair commands. A well- known machine learning technique -least mean squares gradient descent - will be tested for matching the natural motor primitives of the subjects with an appropriate set of control signals to the wheelchair. Finally the safe VR environment will allow us to test whether it is most efficient to learn by gradually speeding up wheelchair motions or by gradually slowing them down. The results of these studies are expected to guide the development of new technology for assistive devices based on human motor learning and on engineering of adaptive control. Many disabled individuals are facing difficult challenges to take advantage of assistive technologies. In particular the safe and efficient use of powered wheelchair is limited by the need for patients to learn to operate their control apparatus. The proposed studies will investigate the possibility to reverse this situation and take advantage of advanced technologies for adapting the control apparatus to the residual skills of the patients. n/a",Motor Learning for the Control of an Assistive Device,7488480,R21HD053608,"['Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Development', 'Elbow', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Goggles', 'Head', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quadriplegia', 'Residual state', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Wheelchairs', 'Wrist', 'base', 'body sense', 'computer generated', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'healthy volunteer', 'independent component analysis', 'motor learning', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R21,2008,98314,0.013199163251365423
"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7392804,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Numbers', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,35821,-0.001539139787871457
"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology. On its successful completion, based on specific milestones, we will move to the more applied work with human subjects.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography.

"Development of a Bidirectional Brain Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have made it possible to move a robotic device in real time, using signals obtained directly from the brain. This field of Brain Machine Interface (BMI) has the means to provide movement for paralyzed patients, communication for locked-in patients, and a better understanding of the brain for all of society. In order to control movement effectively, the brain must be able to activate muscles appropriately, and monitor the evolving movement quickly and precisely. Existing BMIs for, while remarkable, do each of these tasks in poor imitation of the intact nervous system. Our proposed work addresses these limitations by developing a bidirectional interface that produces movement in a more natural way, and provides feedback about the movement by direct, electrical stimulation of the brain. Our partnership includes members at Northwestern Univ (NU), Univ of Chicago (UC), Univ of Mass, Amherst (UMass), and the autonomous Univ of Mexico (UNAM). Partners have advanced degrees in a range of biological science, computer science, physics, mathematics, and engineering disciplines. Miller (NU) will coordinate the partnership. He has extensive experience with a wide range of recording, stimulation and behavioral protocols in behaving monkeys. Hatsopoulos (UC) is at the forefront of the field of multi-electrode recordings. He was a leading member of the first group to demonstrate visually guided BMI control by a primate. Barto (U Mass) has done pioneering research in neural networks, machine learning and stochastic optimization. Fagg (UMass) is an authority in the control of reaching and grasping robots that learn to interact with the environment. Together they will develop the decoders of activity from the brain used to cause movement. Romo (UNAM), is a world leader in studies of the perceptual and decision making processes induced by electrical stimulation of the brain.

"Experimental and Computational Studies of Concept Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is aimed at developing better understanding of how people bring their prior knowledge to the table when learning about new concepts. Both experimental studies and computational models of these processes will be used to further understanding of this fundamental aspect of human cognition. The proposal focuses on effects and interactions that show that memorized exemplars of a problem are involved with concept learning, on processes involved in unsupervised sorting without feedback, and on how these two processes interact with pre-existing concepts and relational knowledge. New computational models will incorporate exemplars and unsupervised learning into an existing model of knowledge and supervised learning, accounting for a variety of previously observed and newly predicted effects. Experiments involving human participants will investigate interactions of prior knowledge with frequency, exposure, and concept structure. Experiments are paired with the modeling so that new empirical discoveries will go hand-in-hand with theoretical development. If successful, this model will be the only one in the field that accounts for this range of phenomena, encompassing both statistical learning and use of prior knowledge in concept acquisition. Relevance to Public Health: Categorization and category learning are fundamental aspects of cognition, allowing people to intelligently respond to the world. As categorization can be impaired by neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, dementia, and amnesia, a rigorous understanding of the processes involved in normal populations aides the research and treatment of disorders in patients. This project will provide a detailed computational model of concept learning, which can then serve as a model to investigate what has gone wrong when the process is disrupted in clinical populations.           n/a",Experimental and Computational Studies of Concept Learning,7489320,F32MH076452,"['Accounting', 'Amnesia', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Computer Simulation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'base', 'computer studies', 'concept', 'experience', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'theories']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2008,52898,0.00212757901875928
"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program. The proposed BRP will be lead by Drs. De Luca, Roy, and Adam, key personnel from Boston University (BU) with expertise in biomedical engineering and EMG system development.

"Sequence Induction in Infancy: A systematic approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thirteen experiments investigate the early development of the ability to learn patterns in sequential input. Such evidence would seem likely to provide a substantial contribution to our knowledge of how infants identify both concrete and abstract patterns, a fundamental aspect of cognitive development. The proposed experiments are organized into three broad studies. In the first study, we will examine ""ancillary"" factors that may influence sequence learning in infancy. We emphasize the importance of two kinds of relations between elements in any multi-element group or string: itemwise relations, between specific instances (e.g., statistical learning), and variablewise relations, between algebraic placeholders (e.g., abstract pattern or rule learning). We argue that a first step toward any programmatic series of experiments on these kinds of learning-must involve an understanding of processing limitations that may constrain performance. In the second study, we will investigate the different kinds of patterns infants may be able to learn, using past and pilot data as a guide for our theorizing. In the final study, we will explore the intriguing possibility that infants may learn more than one pattern in any single set of inputs, a classic question that has received little empirical attention in the literature on cognitive development. The short-term objectives of the present proposal are to elucidate fundamental developmental mechanisms in the ability to detect abstract visual and auditory structure. The long-term goals are to shed light on the larger question of how knowledge is acquired and structured in the human, how perceptual skills impact knowledge acquisition and structure, and how to best characterize early development. In the future, such understanding may aid in the formulation of diagnostics and treatments for some developmental disorders.           n/a",Sequence Induction in Infancy: A systematic approach,7394931,R01HD048733,"['Address', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Be++ element', 'Beds', 'Beryllium', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Compatible', 'Conceptual Domain', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Count', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Formulations', 'Elements', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Range', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vegetables', 'Visual', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'coping', 'developmental disease', 'infancy', 'neglect', 'object perception', 'postnatal', 'research study', 'sequence learning', 'size', 'skills']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2008,252858,-0.02723645597116663
"Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  fMRI experiments produce large, numerically rich, but noisy data sets that pose a challenge for extracting the signal variance and establishing the correspondence between that signal and cognitive variables.  Conventional analysis has reduced the dimensionality of fMRI data by searching for clusters of voxels that show similar responses to experimental manipulations and averaging the signal within those clusters.  We have introduced a new approach to fMRI data analysis, ""multi-voxel pattern analysis"", that examines higher spatial frequency patterns of activity - the voxel-by-voxel variation of response within a region - and have shown that this method greatly increases the sensitivity of fMRI (Haxby et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2004; OToole et al. 2004; Polyn et al. 2004).  In the proposed investigations, we will develop new methods for analysis of spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity in relation to two specific problems in fMRI data analysis:  1.  accounting for inter-individual variation in functional neuroanatomy, and 2.  the relation between spatially-distributed neural population responses and cognitive representations.  This work will involve the efforts of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cognitive neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, and signal- processing engineers.  We propose the development of analytic methods for aligning the functional neuroanatomy of individual brains based on the patterns of neural activity that are elicited by a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.  We predict that these methods will enhance the sensitivity of group statistical tests of fMRI data, will allow the investigation of the inter-individual consistency of higher spatial frequency topographic representations, and will provide explicit measures of inter-individual variation in the location, organization, and spatial extent of functional maps, with potential applications for studies of clinical conditions.  We propose, further, to develop methods for detecting and analyzing distributed patterns of neural activity that make use of prior knowledge about the structure of the cognitive representations that are associated with those neural activities.  We predict that these methods will increase the sensitivity of multi-voxel pattern analysis and will allow the investigation of how cognitive information is represented in topographically-organized, spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity.         n/a",Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data,7480923,R01MH075706,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Engineering', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Normal Range', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Range', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2008,319340,0.005121421854123679
"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results. A dissemination plan is included to make this technology available to the Motor Control community. Commercialization will be realized through Altec Inc. This technology will enable researchers in the fields of Motor Control, Aging, Exercise Physiology, Space Medicine, and Ergonomics, where it is of interest to understand how the CNS controls muscles, and how that control is altered as a consequence of aging, exercise, exposure to microgravity, fatigue, and excessive and prolonged force production. It will be useful to clinicians for assessing the degree of dysfunction in upper motoneuron diseases such as Cerebral Palsy, Parkinson's Disease, ALS, Stroke, and other disorders.              n/a",Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior,7489322,R01NS058250,"['Action Potentials', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'International', 'Invasive', 'Left', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Microgravity', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Fibers', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Needles', 'Neurons', 'Numbers', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Right-On', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Space Medicine', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'assault', 'base', 'commercialization', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'ergonomics', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'motor control', 'neuromuscular system', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotechnology', 'new technology', 'non-invasive system', 'performance tests', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'technology/technique']",NINDS,"ALTEC, INC.",R01,2008,455129,0.007701164963209338
"CRCNS: fMRI Pattern Analysis of Neural Correlates of Natural Scene Categories    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For over half a century, vision scientists have been decomposing visual scenes into simple, more tractable components in an attempt to understand how the brain accomplishes vision. Although this endeavor has revealed much about the specialized subsystems of vision, surprisingly little is know about how, or even where in the brain, we process scenes as a whole. How is it, for instance, that the brain determines whether it is looking at a forest or a city skyline? One reason for the paucity of research on this topic may be that the neural representation of a scene is likely to be highly distributed, a coding scheme not easily identified by many traditional neuroscience methods. The objective of the proposed research is to use a new method of analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that is designed to leverage activity patterns across the brain, in order to better understand how the brain categorizes natural scenes. In particular, the project combines expertise from computer vision and neuroimaging by applying statistical pattern recognition algorithms to fMRI data to understand how the brain distinguishes between different categories of natural scene (e.g., a beach versus a highway). The proposed project will use and develop a statistical pattern recognition approach to fMRI analysis to accomplish three more specific objectives: (i) to identify the neural representation of natural scene categories, (ii) to identify the computational principles for forming and using the neural representation of natural scene categories, and (iii) to explore the effects of attention and expectation on natural scene categorization. The insights gained from these experiments will be verified in a computational model of natural scene perception, which in turn will generate predictions for future experiments. Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: Although previous research has shown that humans can quickly and effortless categorize natural scenes, there is very little understanding of how this is accomplished in the brain. The research proposed here will significantly advance our understanding of how natural scenes are represented in the brain and begin to uncover the computational strategies the brain employs in quickly and accurately extracting the gist of a scene. Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity: The highly interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research requires intense interactions among psychologists, neuroscientists, and computer vision researchers. As such, the project not only promises to increase communication among very different disciplines but it will also to provide doctoral students with truly interdisciplinary training. The PIs are committed to providing a highly interactive research environment, mentoring students across disciplines, and fostering the interdisciplinary approach to science in general. Moreover, two of the three PIs are women working in fields in which women are traditionally underrepresented and are committed to improving the representation and visibility of women in science. Finally, the principles derived from this project are likely to have implications beyond the domain of natural scene perception. By refining the pattern recognition algorithms and their application to fMRI data, the project will expand the set of tools available to neuroscientists wishing to study a whole host of complex human behaviors that likely depend on subtle but distributed patterns of activity in the brain.           n/a",CRCNS: fMRI Pattern Analysis of Neural Correlates of Natural Scene Categories,7615848,R01EY019429,"['Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Working Women', 'day', 'design', 'expectation', 'forest', 'improved', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neuroimaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'tool', 'vision science']",NEI,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,316386,-0.007690324681261831
"A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of advanced neuroprosthetic systems and brain-machine interfaces for high-capacity, real-time, bi-directional communication with the nervous system is a major challenge to the emerging neural engineering discipline.  While recent advances in the fabrication of high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs) for multiunit recording and stimulation have triggered numerous neurobiological discoveries, the resulting large data throughput and the variability of cortical responses over repeated trials preclude the ability to design a wireless, adaptive, fully implantable large-scale interface to the cortex.  This severely limits the feasibility and space of experimental paradigms needed to improve our understanding of the nervous system functionality and characterize cortical responses in freely behaving subjects interacting naturally with their surroundings.  The objective of this project is to develop a wireless interface to the cortex capable of processing simultaneously recorded neural signalsfrom 64 electrode channels in real time.  The project has 3 aims:  1.  Develop advanced signal processing algorithms for sensing and decoding neuronal response properties from distributed intra-cortical neural activity:  1) Optimize our existing signal processing algorithms for hardware implementation to extract the desired neural activity early in the data stream; 2) Develop new algorithms for decoding these responses to characterize the natural behavior of awake, behaving animal models.  2.  Design low-power integrated circuits and wireless telemetry for a 64 channel system:  1) Optimize the design of a low power Neural Interface Node (NIN) module to feature wireless communication and powering capability for subcutaneous implantation; 2) Design and fabricate an extracranial Manager Interface Module (MIM) to permit:  a) wireless powering and data exchange with up to 2 implanted NIN modules; b) wireless bidirectional exchange of data and control with a central base station.  3.  Demonstrate the system functionality in vitro and vivo:  1) Build a 32 channel system and test its performance in vitro in retinal slices and in vivo in awake behaving rodents; 2) Demonstrate the real time functionality of a 64 channel system in vitro and explore its feasibility in vivo; 3) Optimize the entire system design, and benchmark it against a commercial 64 channel wired data acquisition system.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project seeks to develop a wireless electronic microsystem to be implanted in the rat brain to continuously monitor neural signals when the rat is freely behaving in an open environment.

"Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Over 600,000 Americans have severely impaired motor function from disorders including spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontine stroke, and cerebral palsy. A brain-machine interface (BMI) could enable locked-in or tetraplegic patients to communicate and interact with their environment. Two crucial decisions in designing a BMI are (1) what type of brain signals to use as inputs to a controller and (2) what methods to use to decode those signals. Most BMIs have used either noninvasive scalp EEG recordings or invasive intracortical recordings of single- or multi-neuron spikes as control inputs. A few have used subdural or intracortical local field potentials (LFPs). However, no group has yet systematically compared these signals in motor cortex for use in BMI applications. This proposal's first goal is to assess the relative performance of spikes and field potentials (both intracortical and epidural) as control inputs for a variety of movement-related outputs. Epidural field potentials (EFPs) are intermediate in invasiveness, signal quality, stability and spatial resolution compared with existing scalp, subdural, and intracortical recordings, and thus represent an unexplored middle ground. This proposal's second goal is to evaluate linear and nonlinear techniques-including several novel to BMI applications-for both decoding data and reducing the inherently large dimensionality of data from multiple neural signals. The primary hypotheses of the proposed project are (1) that spikes will perform better in decoding more complex movement-related outputs, but that field potentials may perform similarly on decoding simpler outputs, and (2) that nonlinear decoders and dimensionality-reduction techniques may provide improved accuracy over linear methods. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are 1) to evaluate single neuron spikes as inputs to decoders of movement- related outputs, 2) to develop a novel epidural multi-electrode recording technique in the macaque monkey, and 3) to evaluate field potential signals as inputs to decoders of movement-related outputs. Aims 1 and 3 will involve application of dimensionality-reduction algorithms (e.g., independent components analysis, Isomap) and decoding algorithms (system identification, neural networks, support vector machines) to both spikes and field potentials. Aim 2 will entail using a computer model and spatial spectral analysis to optimize the epidural electrode array design. This project will provide the first comparison of spikes, LFPs and EFPs as inputs for identical BMI output applications. The supervision of Drs. Lee Miller and W. Zev Rymer, with additional guidance from Drs. Simon Levine, Jonathan Wolpaw and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, will provide the principal investigator with expertise in recording and processing both spikes and field potentials for BMI applications using a variety of state-of-the- art techniques. A comprehensive career development plan including clinical and research mentoring, seminars, and courses, will foster the candidate's transition into an independent physician-scientist.           n/a",Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface,7470575,K08NS060223,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Arts', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Count', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Dura Mater', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pontine structure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Upper arm', 'Visual', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'computerized data processing', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'feeding', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'motor control', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'surgical technique development']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2008,167832,0.021381947935305005
"An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After the first four years of our Bioengineering Research Partnership, implantable devices for epilepsy are now a reality. This is due, in part, to translation of technology developed by our group to industry. Data from multi-center clinical trials of first generation responsive antiepileptic devices indicate that this new technology is safe, and that there is promise of significant benefit to patients. They also demonstrate that 1st-generation devices rarely make patients seizure free. This is because we do not yet understand when, where and how to deliver electrical stimulation to pre-empt seizures, or the mechanisms underlying seizure generation in epileptic networks. These challenges, and translating them into more effective second-generation devices, are the focus of this proposal. Specifically, our aims are: (1) To understand mechanisms underlying seizure generation in two well characterized, spontaneously seizing animal models of epilepsy with documented similarities to refractory human epilepsy, (2) To map seizure generation in the epileptic network to determine where to place sensing electrodes and when to stimulate to maximize seizure suppression and minimize side effects. (3) To develop more effective closed loop stimulation algorithms for controlling seizures. These Aims will be accomplished through a series of projects led by established collaborators in neurology, neuroscience, bioengineering and industry, at Penn, CHOP, Georgia Tech, and BioQuantix, Inc. Teams will focus on improving upon results from first-generation human devices through detailed animal experiments on multiple temporal and spatial scales. These include: (1) the cellular level, through broad-band unit recording and biophysically accurate computational modeling; (2) the network level, with in vitro experiments on hippocampal slices using voltage sensitive dyes and multi-electrode arrays; and (3) the whole brain level, through simultaneous micro and macroelectrode field recordings and responsive brain stimulation in vivo. These experiments will build upon the substantial progress made during the first cycle of our Bioengineering Research Partnership grant. The unique composition of our group, its track record of successful technology transfer, and our ability to learn from and immediately convey our discoveries to existing programmable devices, provide an unprecedented opportunity to perform cutting-edge neuroscience and bioengineering research and immediately translate it into better treatment for patients.           n/a",An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures,7409622,R01NS041811,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Dyes', 'Eels', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic Models', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Localized', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors', 'Methods', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent Model', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'USA Georgia', 'Western Asia Georgia', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'markov model', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'sensor', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2008,1249160,0.016733587600345223
"Towards a cognitive framework for understanding cellular behavior Abstract Free-living cells display strong genome-wide transcriptional responses to changes in individual environmental parameters such as oxygen and temperature. Such transcriptional dynamics are thought to be the basis of a homeostatic response that attempts to reverse the immediate intracellular consequences resulting from the specific change in the environment. I present an alternative interpretation where transcriptional responses reflect a multifaceted behavioral program in response to global changes in the environment that are anticipated to follow the perturbation. This results from the fact that native microbial habitats are highly structured, giving rise to strong correlations between environmental parameters. Over geological timescales, such correlations can be internalized through an ""associative learning"" process that shapes the connectivity and dynamics of regulatory networks. Such internal models should allow microbes to predict the future trajectory of the environment based on immediate sensory information. We have seen evidence of this anticipatory behavior in responses of the bacterium Escherichia coli to changes in temperature and oxygen that correspond to transitions between the outside environment and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. These internal representations seem to reflect a true associative learning paradigm, since they show plasticity upon exposure to novel environments. These phenomena increasingly demand that we interpret microbial behaviors from a cognitive perspective, much as we do for understanding animal behaviors. I propose a multi-faceted research program aimed at 1) establishing that these phenomena, indeed, represent cognitive modeling of microbial habitats, 2) revealing the underlying network mechanisms, and 3) exploring associative learning of novel environments through laboratory experimental evolution. The proposed work establishes deep connections between the disparate fields of microbial ecology, regulatory network evolution, and behavior. In so doing, it challenges the dominance of the century-old notion of homeostasis, with fundamental implications for how we understand and control microbial behavior, especially in the context of disease. n/a",Towards a cognitive framework for understanding cellular behavior,7555864,DP1OD003787,"['Acidity', 'Acids', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Behavior', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Association Learning', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacteroides fragilis', 'Base Pairing', 'Basic Science', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Carbon', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemotaxis', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Coupling', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Cytochromes', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Depth', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Drops', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Employee Strikes', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Global Change', 'Growth', 'Habitats', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Homeostasis', 'Homo', 'Human', 'Hybridization Array', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Physiology', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Detection', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'New York', 'Nitrogen', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oral cavity', 'Organism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Output', 'Oxidases', 'Oxygen', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Perception', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Psychological Manipulation', 'Psychology', 'Pulse taking', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Salts', 'Science', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'abstracting', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'cytochrome c oxidase', 'day', 'density', 'design', 'electron donor', 'enteric pathogen', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'life history', 'microbial', 'microbial disease', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'null mutation', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'quorum sensing', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'response', 'second messenger', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",OD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,DP1,2008,805000,-0.019057905125285577
"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7127674,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'addiction', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'human study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2007,220117,-0.012787157857065759
"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7269518,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Numbers', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2007,35821,-0.001539139787871457
"Motor Learning for the Control of an Assistive Device    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of these studies is to understand how movements of the body can be harnessed and trained to control electrically powered wheelchairs. Advanced wheelchair technology is often perceived to be a barrier by a large number of potential wheelchair users. An approach is proposed for the removal of this barrier based on adapting the assistive technology to the residual unconstrained mobility of the patients and on enhancing motor learning. This exploratory project aims at establishing the feasibility of such an approach and at developing training methods based on the identification of natural motions and on the use of virtual reality (VR). The proposed studies will be carried out on quadriplegic spinal cord injured patients with complete or incomplete cervical injuries. Healthy volunteers will also participate in these study to fine-tune the experimental apparatus and to provide a reference baseline to assess learning and coordination. Subjects will wear a novel upper-body sensing garment. A total of 52 electrical signals generated by the garment will be modulated by movements of the wrist, elbow, shoulder and torso. These signals will be mapped into the velocity commands for a simulated wheelchair. Subjects will wear VR-goggles and a head tracker, which will provide them with a immersive view of a computer-generated environment from the perspective of the simulated wheelchair. The combination of virtual reality environments and wearable signal technology will provide a framework for evaluating training protocols that would not be feasible with actual wheelchairs. The proposed studies are organized in two specific aims: (Aim 1.) To identify motor primitives for the control of a virtual wheelchair by unrestricted upper body motions Three well-established signal processing techniques - Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis and Isomap - will be used and compared for extracting low-dimensional signal patterns from the garment signals (Aim 2.) To identify maps and procedures that facilitate motor learning. The signal patterns extracted from Aim 1 will be used to design and test new transformations from subject motions to wheelchair commands. A well- known machine learning technique -least mean squares gradient descent - will be tested for matching the natural motor primitives of the subjects with an appropriate set of control signals to the wheelchair. Finally the safe VR environment will allow us to test whether it is most efficient to learn by gradually speeding up wheelchair motions or by gradually slowing them down. The results of these studies are expected to guide the development of new technology for assistive devices based on human motor learning and on engineering of adaptive control. Many disabled individuals are facing difficult challenges to take advantage of assistive technologies. In particular the safe and efficient use of powered wheelchair is limited by the need for patients to learn to operate their control apparatus. The proposed studies will investigate the possibility to reverse this situation and take advantage of advanced technologies for adapting the control apparatus to the residual skills of the patients.       n/a",Motor Learning for the Control of an Assistive Device,7258179,R21HD053608,"['Accidents', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Asia', 'Behavior', 'Biomechanics', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elbow', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Goggles', 'Head', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quadriplegia', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Wheelchairs', 'Wrist', 'base', 'body sense', 'computer generated', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'disability', 'healthy volunteer', 'independent component analysis', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'motor learning', 'new technology', 'novel', 'research study', 'skills', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO,R21,2007,225323,0.013199163251365423
"Development of a Bidirectional Brain Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have made it possible to move a robotic device in real time, using signals obtained directly from the brain. This field of Brain Machine Interface (BMI) has the means to provide movement for paralyzed patients, communication for locked-in patients, and a better understanding of the brain for all of society. In order to control movement effectively, the brain must be able to activate muscles appropriately, and monitor the evolving movement quickly and precisely. Existing BMIs for, while remarkable, do each of these tasks in poor imitation of the intact nervous system. Our proposed work addresses these limitations by developing a bidirectional interface that produces movement in a more natural way, and provides feedback about the movement by direct, electrical stimulation of the brain. Our partnership includes members at Northwestern Univ (NU), Univ of Chicago (UC), Univ of Mass, Amherst (UMass), and the autonomous Univ of Mexico (UNAM). Partners have advanced degrees in a range of biological science, computer science, physics, mathematics, and engineering disciplines. Miller (NU) will coordinate the partnership. He has extensive experience with a wide range of recording, stimulation and behavioral protocols in behaving monkeys. Hatsopoulos (UC) is at the forefront of the field of multi-electrode recordings. He was a leading member of the first group to demonstrate visually guided BMI control by a primate. Barto (U Mass) has done pioneering research in neural networks, machine learning and stochastic optimization. Fagg (UMass) is an authority in the control of reaching and grasping robots that learn to interact with the environment. Together they will develop the decoders of activity from the brain used to cause movement. Romo (UNAM), is a world leader in studies of the perceptual and decision making processes induced by electrical stimulation of the brain. Solla (NU) is an expert in neural networks and information theory. With Romo, she will develop optimal routines to encode information in stimulus trains to provide feedback to the brain. Mussa-Ivaldi (NU) will focus on the overall design and evaluation of the interfaces.

"Experimental and Computational Studies of Concept Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is aimed at developing better understanding of how people bring their prior knowledge to the table when learning about new concepts. Both experimental studies and computational models of these processes will be used to further understanding of this fundamental aspect of human cognition. The proposal focuses on effects and interactions that show that memorized exemplars of a problem are involved with concept learning, on processes involved in unsupervised sorting without feedback, and on how these two processes interact with pre-existing concepts and relational knowledge. New computational models will incorporate exemplars and unsupervised learning into an existing model of knowledge and supervised learning, accounting for a variety of previously observed and newly predicted effects. Experiments involving human participants will investigate interactions of prior knowledge with frequency, exposure, and concept structure. Experiments are paired with the modeling so that new empirical discoveries will go hand-in-hand with theoretical development. If successful, this model will be the only one in the field that accounts for this range of phenomena, encompassing both statistical learning and use of prior knowledge in concept acquisition. Relevance to Public Health: Categorization and category learning are fundamental aspects of cognition, allowing people to intelligently respond to the world. As categorization can be impaired by neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, dementia, and amnesia, a rigorous understanding of the processes involved in normal populations aides the research and treatment of disorders in patients.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program.

"Sequence Induction in Infancy: A systematic approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thirteen experiments investigate the early development of the ability to learn patterns in sequential input. Such evidence would seem likely to provide a substantial contribution to our knowledge of how infants identify both concrete and abstract patterns, a fundamental aspect of cognitive development. The proposed experiments are organized into three broad studies. In the first study, we will examine ""ancillary"" factors that may influence sequence learning in infancy. We emphasize the importance of two kinds of relations between elements in any multi-element group or string: itemwise relations, between specific instances (e.g., statistical learning), and variablewise relations, between algebraic placeholders (e.g., abstract pattern or rule learning). We argue that a first step toward any programmatic series of experiments on these kinds of learning-must involve an understanding of processing limitations that may constrain performance. In the second study, we will investigate the different kinds of patterns infants may be able to learn, using past and pilot data as a guide for our theorizing. In the final study, we will explore the intriguing possibility that infants may learn more than one pattern in any single set of inputs, a classic question that has received little empirical attention in the literature on cognitive development. The short-term objectives of the present proposal are to elucidate fundamental developmental mechanisms in the ability to detect abstract visual and auditory structure. The long-term goals are to shed light on the larger question of how knowledge is acquired and structured in the human, how perceptual skills impact knowledge acquisition and structure, and how to best characterize early development. In the future, such understanding may aid in the formulation of diagnostics and treatments for some developmental disorders.           n/a",Sequence Induction in Infancy: A systematic approach,7251991,R01HD048733,"['Address', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Be++ element', 'Beds', 'Beryllium', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Compatible', 'Conceptual Domain', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Count', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Formulations', 'Elements', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Range', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vegetables', 'Visual', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'coping', 'developmental disease', 'infancy', 'neglect', 'object perception', 'postnatal', 'research study', 'sequence learning', 'size', 'skills']",NICHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,304197,-0.02723645597116663
"Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  fMRI experiments produce large, numerically rich, but noisy data sets that pose a challenge for extracting the signal variance and establishing the correspondence between that signal and cognitive variables.  Conventional analysis has reduced the dimensionality of fMRI data by searching for clusters of voxels that show similar responses to experimental manipulations and averaging the signal within those clusters.  We have introduced a new approach to fMRI data analysis, ""multi-voxel pattern analysis"", that examines higher spatial frequency patterns of activity - the voxel-by-voxel variation of response within a region - and have shown that this method greatly increases the sensitivity of fMRI (Haxby et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2004; OToole et al. 2004; Polyn et al. 2004).  In the proposed investigations, we will develop new methods for analysis of spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity in relation to two specific problems in fMRI data analysis:  1.  accounting for inter-individual variation in functional neuroanatomy, and 2.  the relation between spatially-distributed neural population responses and cognitive representations.  This work will involve the efforts of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cognitive neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, and signal- processing engineers.  We propose the development of analytic methods for aligning the functional neuroanatomy of individual brains based on the patterns of neural activity that are elicited by a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.  We predict that these methods will enhance the sensitivity of group statistical tests of fMRI data, will allow the investigation of the inter-individual consistency of higher spatial frequency topographic representations, and will provide explicit measures of inter-individual variation in the location, organization, and spatial extent of functional maps, with potential applications for studies of clinical conditions.  We propose, further, to develop methods for detecting and analyzing distributed patterns of neural activity that make use of prior knowledge about the structure of the cognitive representations that are associated with those neural activities.  We predict that these methods will increase the sensitivity of multi-voxel pattern analysis and will allow the investigation of how cognitive information is represented in topographically-organized, spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity.         n/a",Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data,7613805,R01MH075706,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Engineering', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Normal Range', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Range', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2007,320177,0.005121421854123679
"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results. A dissemination plan is included to make this technology available to the Motor Control community. Commercialization will be realized through Altec Inc. This technology will enable researchers in the fields of Motor Control, Aging, Exercise Physiology, Space Medicine, and Ergonomics, where it is of interest to understand how the CNS controls muscles, and how that control is altered as a consequence of aging, exercise, exposure to microgravity, fatigue, and excessive and prolonged force production.

"Generation and Description of Dendritic Morphology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This continuing project is directed at describing dendrite structure in a compact yet sufficiently complete and detailed fashion to allow the computer generation of morphologically accurate neuronal models. Dendrite morphology plays a fundamental role in physiological and pathological brain function by subserving and shaping network connectivity and by integrating the complex pattern of synaptic inputs received by the neuron. A parsimonious and algorithmic description of dendritic shape is a crucial step towards the quantitative characterization of the structure-activity relationship in the nervous system and it constitutes an effective way to represent, compress, store, exchange, and amplify extremely complex neuroanatomical data. Neuroanatomical algorithms and models have been developed to simulate and quantitatively analyze the three-dimensional structure of dendritic trees in the same format used to represent experimentally reconstructed neurons.      The specific aims of this project are: (1) to expand and improve neuroanatomically plausible algorithms of dendritic structure and development by including determinants of three-dimensional branch orientation and dependence of growth upon local and global influences (e.g. diameter and neuronal size, respectively); (2) to enhance and distribute the analysis, modeling, and data basing software in order to provide experimental and computational neuroscientists with web-based tools to query, retrieve, measure, classify, and synthesize dendritic morphology data; (3) to continue the experimental reconstruction and analysis of hippocampal pyramidal cells and spinal motoneurons with different experimental protocols and in early postnatal periods; and to integrate these data with detailed biophysical models of neuronal electrophysiology. The informatics and neuroscience components of this research are deeply intertwined and span a variety of scientific approaches, including ""wet"" experiments, computational simulations, statistical analysis and data mining. This will require the design and implementation of novel neuroinformatics tools for data handling and integration, and their distribution to the wider neuroscience community.         n/a",Generation and Description of Dendritic Morphology,7233290,R01NS039600,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Dendrites', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscopic', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neonatal', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Spinal', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'insight', 'models and simulation', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,61912,-0.019940179464688457
"Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Over 600,000 Americans have severely impaired motor function from disorders including spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontine stroke, and cerebral palsy. A brain-machine interface (BMI) could enable locked-in or tetraplegic patients to communicate and interact with their environment. Two crucial decisions in designing a BMI are (1) what type of brain signals to use as inputs to a controller and (2) what methods to use to decode those signals. Most BMIs have used either noninvasive scalp EEG recordings or invasive intracortical recordings of single- or multi-neuron spikes as control inputs. A few have used subdural or intracortical local field potentials (LFPs). However, no group has yet systematically compared these signals in motor cortex for use in BMI applications. This proposal's first goal is to assess the relative performance of spikes and field potentials (both intracortical and epidural) as control inputs for a variety of movement-related outputs. Epidural field potentials (EFPs) are intermediate in invasiveness, signal quality, stability and spatial resolution compared with existing scalp, subdural, and intracortical recordings, and thus represent an unexplored middle ground. This proposal's second goal is to evaluate linear and nonlinear techniques-including several novel to BMI applications-for both decoding data and reducing the inherently large dimensionality of data from multiple neural signals. The primary hypotheses of the proposed project are (1) that spikes will perform better in decoding more complex movement-related outputs, but that field potentials may perform similarly on decoding simpler outputs, and (2) that nonlinear decoders and dimensionality-reduction techniques may provide improved accuracy over linear methods. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are 1) to evaluate single neuron spikes as inputs to decoders of movement- related outputs, 2) to develop a novel epidural multi-electrode recording technique in the macaque monkey, and 3) to evaluate field potential signals as inputs to decoders of movement-related outputs. Aims 1 and 3 will involve application of dimensionality-reduction algorithms (e.g., independent components analysis, Isomap) and decoding algorithms (system identification, neural networks, support vector machines) to both spikes and field potentials. Aim 2 will entail using a computer model and spatial spectral analysis to optimize the epidural electrode array design. This project will provide the first comparison of spikes, LFPs and EFPs as inputs for identical BMI output applications. The supervision of Drs. Lee Miller and W. Zev Rymer, with additional guidance from Drs. Simon Levine, Jonathan Wolpaw and Nicholas Hatsopoulos, will provide the principal investigator with expertise in recording and processing both spikes and field potentials for BMI applications using a variety of state-of-the- art techniques. A comprehensive career development plan including clinical and research mentoring, seminars, and courses, will foster the candidate's transition into an independent physician-scientist.           n/a",Action Potentials vs. Field Potentials as Inputs to a Brain-Machine Interface,7318680,K08NS060223,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Arts', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Count', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Dura Mater', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pontine structure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quadriplegia', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Upper arm', 'Visual', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'computerized data processing', 'cranium', 'design', 'disability', 'feeding', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'motor control', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'surgical technique development']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2007,167832,0.021381947935305005
"An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After the first four years of our Bioengineering Research Partnership, implantable devices for epilepsy are now a reality. This is due, in part, to translation of technology developed by our group to industry. Data from multi-center clinical trials of first generation responsive antiepileptic devices indicate that this new technology is safe, and that there is promise of significant benefit to patients. They also demonstrate that 1st-generation devices rarely make patients seizure free. This is because we do not yet understand when, where and how to deliver electrical stimulation to pre-empt seizures, or the mechanisms underlying seizure generation in epileptic networks. These challenges, and translating them into more effective second-generation devices, are the focus of this proposal. Specifically, our aims are: (1) To understand mechanisms underlying seizure generation in two well characterized, spontaneously seizing animal models of epilepsy with documented similarities to refractory human epilepsy, (2) To map seizure generation in the epileptic network to determine where to place sensing electrodes and when to stimulate to maximize seizure suppression and minimize side effects. (3) To develop more effective closed loop stimulation algorithms for controlling seizures. These Aims will be accomplished through a series of projects led by established collaborators in neurology, neuroscience, bioengineering and industry, at Penn, CHOP, Georgia Tech, and BioQuantix, Inc. Teams will focus on improving upon results from first-generation human devices through detailed animal experiments on multiple temporal and spatial scales. These include: (1) the cellular level, through broad-band unit recording and biophysically accurate computational modeling; (2) the network level, with in vitro experiments on hippocampal slices using voltage sensitive dyes and multi-electrode arrays; and (3) the whole brain level, through simultaneous micro and macroelectrode field recordings and responsive brain stimulation in vivo. These experiments will build upon the substantial progress made during the first cycle of our Bioengineering Research Partnership grant. The unique composition of our group, its track record of successful technology transfer, and our ability to learn from and immediately convey our discoveries to existing programmable devices, provide an unprecedented opportunity to perform cutting-edge neuroscience and bioengineering research and immediately translate it into better treatment for patients.           n/a",An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures,7125319,R01NS041811,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Dyes', 'Eels', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic Models', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Localized', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors', 'Methods', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent Model', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'USA Georgia', 'Western Asia Georgia', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'markov model', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'sensor', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2007,1322181,0.016733587600345223
"INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES   A common feature of spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurological movement disorders is that the peripheral neuromuscular system remains intact. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) offers the potential to restore movement in these individuals. Impressive improvements in electrode and sensor hardware have recently been made, but development of control algorithms for complex dynamic movements remains difficult.      Reinforcement learning (RL) is a technique from artificial intelligence that has the potential to overcome this problem. A RL-based control system learns from experience how to control movement, in very much the same way as an infant. The system receives information from multiple sensors, as well as a reward signal, and generates actions, i.e. muscle stiimulation levels, that are initially random. The system will learn to predict the consequences of its actions and will ultimately converge to a control strategy that maximizes the sum of rewards over time. An essential feature of RL is that the control strategy is not created by the designer, but is learned from experience. This learning process could ultimately result in motor behavior of much higher quality than can be achieved with traditionally designed feedback control systems, which tend to ""fight"" rather than exploit the natural dynamics of the body such as inertia, pendulum and mass-spring mechanisms. Furthermore, a self learning system has the advantage that it can adapt itself to the user's body mass, muscle strength, as well as variations in electrode location.      The long-term goal is a system that integrates high-level commands from the user with signals from implanted sensors to produce intelligent and adaptive motor function. Feasibility of this concept will be tested here for FES control of six muscles in the upper extremity, to perform the task of reaching in the horizontal plane. The following specific aims are proposed: (1) Implementation of RL control on a virtual arm with computer-generated commands and rewards, (2) RL control on a virtual arm, with commands and rewards given by a human operator, and (3) RL control of muscles in a paralyzed arm in two subjects with high cervical spinal cord injury, with commands and rewards given by the user via a head tracker based input device. n/a",INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES,7085349,R21HD049662,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'electrodes', 'electrostimulus', 'human subject', 'limb movement', 'nervous system prosthesis', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'neuromuscular stimulator', 'neuroregulation', 'spinal cord injury']",NICHD,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COL/MED-CWRU,R21,2006,192359,0.010452134280225308
"New Wavelet-based and Source Separation Methods for fMRI  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available methods of analysis for functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging offer a wealth of possibilities to researchers using this neuroimaging modality. However, these tools suffer from the inherent low signal to noise ratio of the data, and from the limitations of widely used model-based approaches. These problems have been addressed by the community and the literature now describes numerous methods that can remove part of the noise and extract brain activity pattern in a data-driven fashion. This project focuses on the design of optimized algorithms for the estimation and removal of the noise, on the understanding of the applicability of existing data-driven approaches, and on the development of new blind source separation methods for fMRI data. Particular attention will be given to quantification of the gains provided by the newly proposed methods by working on simulated datasets and specifically designed fMRI experiments. The first specific aim is to use a spatio-temporal four-dimensional multiresolution analysis to define an ""'ideal denoising"" scheme for a given study. It will make extensive use of the concept of best wavelet packet basis, which allows the most efficient representation of a signal. The concept wilt first be validated on fMRI rest datasets, and its efficiency will then be measured on simulated and actual data. The second specific aim focuses on blind source separation methods. An in depth study of Independent Component Analysis will be carried out to precisely define its field of applicability on fMRI data. By using sparsity together with time-frequency methods, we will develop new source separation algorithms and will demonstrate their robustness on both simulated and real data.   n/a",New Wavelet-based and Source Separation Methods for fMRI,7107885,R01MH067204,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'human subject', 'mathematics', 'phantom model', 'technology /technique development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,385718,0.004796300972432212
"Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  fMRI experiments produce large, numerically rich, but noisy data sets that pose a challenge for extracting the signal variance and establishing the correspondence between that signal and cognitive variables.  Conventional analysis has reduced the dimensionality of fMRI data by searching for clusters of voxels that show similar responses to experimental manipulations and averaging the signal within those clusters.  We have introduced a new approach to fMRI data analysis, ""multi-voxel pattern analysis"", that examines higher spatial frequency patterns of activity - the voxel-by-voxel variation of response within a region - and have shown that this method greatly increases the sensitivity of fMRI (Haxby et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2004; OToole et al. 2004; Polyn et al. 2004).

"Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to use neuroinformatics to help resolve the conflicting findings from which two models of olfactory coding have emerged. One model proposes that very many low-specificity neural responses represent each odorant and the other model suggests that fewer, more specific olfactory receptors bind to particular molecular features and that the combination of these specific responses characterizes each odorant. Since much of the data supporting the low-specificity model has been collected without regard for the exquisite spatial heterogeneity of the olfactory system, it is possible that the differences in conclusions could be resolved if the distinct types of data that are collected by various laboratories were placed into spatial register with one another. To that end, we have been building an archive of the spatial patterns of glomerular responses evoked by a wide range of odorants, and we have been able to test hypotheses regarding strategies of olfactory coding by calculating homologies across glomerular-layer response patterns. To facilitate our analytical task, and to make it feasible for others to place their data in register with this odorant response archive, we propose to continue to develop analytical and visualization software for olfactory bulb data. We also propose to extend this approach to both the olfactory epithelium and olfactory cortex to be able to understand both the initial coding and synthetic levels of the olfactory system.  These efforts will be freely available via the web site on which our olfactory activity archive is posted. We propose to improve the site by incorporating meta-data, as well as data from labs using other species and other types of data, such as lesions and neurophysiological data that can be located in space. Finally, the wide range of odorants that we must test to capture a sense of the system also will necessitate the use of an informatics approach to allow us to test hypotheses regarding the complex means by which chemical structure is represented in the system. The combination of these approaches should help resolve the differences between the conflicting models of olfactory coding. n/a",Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding,7068069,R01DC006516,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'bioinformatics', 'chemoreceptors', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'image processing', 'information retrieval', 'laboratory mouse', 'laboratory rat', 'mathematical model', 'meta analysis', 'neural information processing', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'olfactions', 'olfactory lobe', 'olfactory stimulus', 'respiratory epithelium', 'sensory mechanism', 'stimulus /response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE,R01,2006,19532,-0.0026058519579317875
"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,7109222,R21NS045410,"['Parkinson&apos', 's disease', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'electromyography', 'human subject', 'method development', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'psychomotor function', 'tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2006,483334,0.0048014626570607845

"Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a series of coordinated computational and electrophysiological studies to identify, analyze, and implement contextual spike-timing codes in the encoding of light intensity, using a well-understood, simple visual system (the Hermissenda eye) that permits detailed cellular mechanistic analyses and biologically realistic, Hodgkin- Huxley level simulations. We further propose to examine mechanisms by which neural ""noise"" paradoxically improves, rather than degrades, light intensity encoding; and the interactions of contextual spike-timing codes with learning-related synaptic plasticity. Implementation experiments to restore network function by explicitly introducing contextual spike-timing relationships may provide powerful, novel evidence regarding the functional consequences of these codes. Specific Aim 1: Role of Network Architecture. Pilot simulation and physiological data indicate that network interactions (feed-forward, feedback, and lateral inhibition) alter contextual spike-timing relationships and may contribute substantially to improved information processing in the network, relative to single cells. We will examine the existence, origins, and consequences of these codes in both the simulated and biological eye. Specific Aim 2: Encoding of Light Intensity. Preliminary evidence indicates that an increase in light intensity produces an increase in both the rate and synchrony of type A photoreceptor spiking, suggesting multiple encoding schemes with potentially complementary roles. Further, the addition of synaptic and ionic neural ""noise"" improves both rate and synchrony encoding of light intensity. We propose to quantify and compare rate and contextual spike-timing codes across light intensities; examine how their performance is affected by the presence of neural noise; and implement relevant algorithms into a neural interface (or simulated interface) to determine whether they improve control of the system and light intensity encoding. Specific Aim 3: Contextual Spike-Timing Codes and Learning. Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements. Taken together, these studies will elucidate neurobiological strategies for information processing, and identify efficient bio-based solutions that may be advantageously incorporated into artificial intelligence systems, robotic systems, or clinical neuroprostheses.         n/a",Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing,7072822,R01MH068392,"['Hermissenda', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'learning', 'light intensity', 'neural information processing', 'neural transmission', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory signal detection', 'visual feedback', 'visual perception', 'visual photoreceptor']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2006,197082,0.008402113248296216
"CRCNS: Learning the Neural Code for Prosthetic Control Current technology allows the simultaneous recording from hundreds of cells in the brains of awake behaving animals. Using this information to understand how the brain represents and processes complex information is a fundamental scientific challenge with large practical benefits to human health. In particular this project will develop technologies for neural prostheses which promise a new generation of therapies for the severely disabled to allow them to regain the ability to interact with the world. To that end, the project has three specific aims: 1) New probabilistic models of the neural code will be developed that exploit machine learning methods (Gibbs learning and boosting) and high performance computing resources. These models will represent the high dimensional probabilistic relationship between multiple behavioral variables and the firing activity of a population of neurons. 2) Neural decoding methods will be developed that model the uncertainty in neural recordings to make sound inferences that can drive neural prostheses. As part of this effort new probabilistic spike sorting algorithms will be developed and tested. 3) Adaptation of cells in the brain will be studied using the statistical models developed here and an understanding of this adaptation will be used to design new algorithms for prosthetic applications. These algorithms will themselves be adaptive in a way that optimizes prosthetic control in the face of a changing neural code. To learn such models from vast amounts of neural data, a new class of mathematical and computational tools is required. An interdisciplinary team including computer scientists, applied mathematicians, and neuroscientists will work in close concert to exploit existing infrastructure and experience with neural prostheses to address fundamental problems necessary for the practical application of these devices in humans.

"Development of a Bidirectional Brain Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have made it possible to move a robotic device in real time, using signals obtained directly from the brain. This field of Brain Machine Interface (BMI) has the means to provide movement for paralyzed patients, communication for locked-in patients, and a better understanding of the brain for all of society. In order to control movement effectively, the brain must be able to activate muscles appropriately, and monitor the evolving movement quickly and precisely. Existing BMIs for, while remarkable, do each of these tasks in poor imitation of the intact nervous system. Our proposed work addresses these limitations by developing a bidirectional interface that produces movement in a more natural way, and provides feedback about the movement by direct, electrical stimulation of the brain. Our partnership includes members at Northwestern Univ (NU), Univ of Chicago (UC), Univ of Mass, Amherst (UMass), and the autonomous Univ of Mexico (UNAM).

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7125904,R01MH066990,"['bioinformatics', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'neural information processing', 'neurophysiology', 'sensory feedback', 'sensory mechanism', 'statistics /biometry']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2006,36891,-0.001539139787871457
"INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES   A common feature of spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurological movement disorders is that the peripheral neuromuscular system remains intact. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) offers the potential to restore movement in these individuals. Impressive improvements in electrode and sensor hardware have recently been made, but development of control algorithms for complex dynamic movements remains difficult.      Reinforcement learning (RL) is a technique from artificial intelligence that has the potential to overcome this problem. A RL-based control system learns from experience how to control movement, in very much the same way as an infant. The system receives information from multiple sensors, as well as a reward signal, and generates actions, i.e. muscle stiimulation levels, that are initially random. The system will learn to predict the consequences of its actions and will ultimately converge to a control strategy that maximizes the sum of rewards over time. An essential feature of RL is that the control strategy is not created by the designer, but is learned from experience. This learning process could ultimately result in motor behavior of much higher quality than can be achieved with traditionally designed feedback control systems, which tend to ""fight"" rather than exploit the natural dynamics of the body such as inertia, pendulum and mass-spring mechanisms. Furthermore, a self learning system has the advantage that it can adapt itself to the user's body mass, muscle strength, as well as variations in electrode location.      The long-term goal is a system that integrates high-level commands from the user with signals from implanted sensors to produce intelligent and adaptive motor function. Feasibility of this concept will be tested here for FES control of six muscles in the upper extremity, to perform the task of reaching in the horizontal plane. The following specific aims are proposed: (1) Implementation of RL control on a virtual arm with computer-generated commands and rewards, (2) RL control on a virtual arm, with commands and rewards given by a human operator, and (3) RL control of muscles in a paralyzed arm in two subjects with high cervical spinal cord injury, with commands and rewards given by the user via a head tracker based input device. n/a",INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF UPPER EXTREMITY NEURAL PROSTHESES,6908435,R21HD049662,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'electrodes', 'electrostimulus', 'human subject', 'limb movement', 'nervous system prosthesis', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'neuromuscular stimulator', 'neuroregulation', 'spinal cord injury']",NICHD,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COL/MED-CWRU,R21,2005,164156,0.010452134280225308
"CRCNS: Machine Learning for Analysis of fMRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",CRCNS: Machine Learning for Analysis of fMRI,7051239,R01DA020949,"['behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'cocaine', 'computer data analysis', 'drug addiction', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'genotype', 'human subject', 'neuropsychology', 'reinforcer', 'substance abuse related behavior']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2005,253116,-0.012649634866355126
"FINGER COORDINATION IN ELDERLY Impairment of hand function with age is a major disabling factor limiting many activities of daily living.  A decrease in the hand dexterity may lead to a loss of independence and require external care during most everyday activities.  Our present understanding of the functioning of the human hand and changes in its function with age is limited.  This makes it imperative to perform studies directed at improved understanding of the hand function and its deterioration with age. Series of studies on control subjects and preliminary findings in a small group of elderly subjects have allowed us to formulate two major hypotheses: (a) Aging is associated with selective impairment of intrinsic hand muscles; and (b) Aging is associated with an increase in force deficit during multi-finger tasks.  The following research program has been elaborated for an analysis of possible contribution of these age-related changes to the loss of hand dexterity with age: (1) Confirmation of the preliminary conclusions using a larger subject population and a wider spectrum of tasks; (2) Analysis of the effects of these changes on crucial features of multi-finger synergies such as minimization of secondary moments and patterns of variability of individual finger forces (error compensation among fingers); (3) Analysis of possible changes in finger and hand coordination during more common actions such as gripping and bi-manual object handling; and (4) Analysis of correlations between changes in the indices of finger coordination and activities of daily living that involve hand function. Seven experiments on elderly and control subjects are suggested that include force production by sets of fingers in gripping and pressing tasks, self-imposed perturbations, and bi-manual object handling.  The research will combine noninvasive behavioral, biomechanical, electrophysiological, and modeling methods, as well as questionnaires.  In one experiment, the results will be compared with indices of the activities of daily living. Disprovable predictions are made for each experiment.

"New Wavelet-based and Source Separation Methods for fMRI  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available methods of analysis for functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging offer a wealth of possibilities to researchers using this neuroimaging modality. However, these tools suffer from the inherent low signal to noise ratio of the data, and from the limitations of widely used model-based approaches. These problems have been addressed by the community and the literature now describes numerous methods that can remove part of the noise and extract brain activity pattern in a data-driven fashion. This project focuses on the design of optimized algorithms for the estimation and removal of the noise, on the understanding of the applicability of existing data-driven approaches, and on the development of new blind source separation methods for fMRI data. Particular attention will be given to quantification of the gains provided by the newly proposed methods by working on simulated datasets and specifically designed fMRI experiments. The first specific aim is to use a spatio-temporal four-dimensional multiresolution analysis to define an ""'ideal denoising"" scheme for a given study. It will make extensive use of the concept of best wavelet packet basis, which allows the most efficient representation of a signal. The concept wilt first be validated on fMRI rest datasets, and its efficiency will then be measured on simulated and actual data. The second specific aim focuses on blind source separation methods.

"Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to use neuroinformatics to help resolve the conflicting findings from which two models of olfactory coding have emerged. One model proposes that very many low-specificity neural responses represent each odorant and the other model suggests that fewer, more specific olfactory receptors bind to particular molecular features and that the combination of these specific responses characterizes each odorant. Since much of the data supporting the low-specificity model has been collected without regard for the exquisite spatial heterogeneity of the olfactory system, it is possible that the differences in conclusions could be resolved if the distinct types of data that are collected by various laboratories were placed into spatial register with one another. To that end, we have been building an archive of the spatial patterns of glomerular responses evoked by a wide range of odorants, and we have been able to test hypotheses regarding strategies of olfactory coding by calculating homologies across glomerular-layer response patterns. To facilitate our analytical task, and to make it feasible for others to place their data in register with this odorant response archive, we propose to continue to develop analytical and visualization software for olfactory bulb data. We also propose to extend this approach to both the olfactory epithelium and olfactory cortex to be able to understand both the initial coding and synthetic levels of the olfactory system.  These efforts will be freely available via the web site on which our olfactory activity archive is posted. We propose to improve the site by incorporating meta-data, as well as data from labs using other species and other types of data, such as lesions and neurophysiological data that can be located in space. Finally, the wide range of odorants that we must test to capture a sense of the system also will necessitate the use of an informatics approach to allow us to test hypotheses regarding the complex means by which chemical structure is represented in the system. The combination of these approaches should help resolve the differences between the conflicting models of olfactory coding. n/a",Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding,6937143,R01DC006516,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'bioinformatics', 'chemoreceptors', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'image processing', 'information retrieval', 'laboratory mouse', 'laboratory rat', 'mathematical model', 'meta analysis', 'neural information processing', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'olfactions', 'olfactory lobe', 'olfactory stimulus', 'respiratory epithelium', 'sensory mechanism', 'stimulus /response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE,R01,2005,20000,-0.0026058519579317875
"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks. The proposed studies therefore         represent the ability to study information processing of the cerebellum using        quite tractable motor behaviors and then to apply that information to more           complex cognitive processes. Thus, these studies will provide a basic                understanding of information processing for important aspects of the motor           system, and could provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of the           neural basis of information processing that is applied to cognitive properties       as well.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning,6889075,R01MH057051,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'behavioral extinction', 'biological models', 'brain electronic stimulator', 'cerebellar Purkinje cell', 'cerebellar nuclei', 'cerebellum', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'electrophysiology', 'eye movements', 'laboratory rabbit', 'learning', 'microelectrodes', 'neural information processing', 'neural plasticity', 'neural transmission', 'neurons', 'operant conditionings', 'psychomotor function', 'reflex', 'statistics /biometry', 'stimulus /response', 'synapses']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2005,222750,0.003262847196721656
"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.

"Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a series of coordinated computational and electrophysiological studies to identify, analyze, and implement contextual spike-timing codes in the encoding of light intensity, using a well-understood, simple visual system (the Hermissenda eye) that permits detailed cellular mechanistic analyses and biologically realistic, Hodgkin- Huxley level simulations. We further propose to examine mechanisms by which neural ""noise"" paradoxically improves, rather than degrades, light intensity encoding; and the interactions of contextual spike-timing codes with learning-related synaptic plasticity. Implementation experiments to restore network function by explicitly introducing contextual spike-timing relationships may provide powerful, novel evidence regarding the functional consequences of these codes. Specific Aim 1: Role of Network Architecture. Pilot simulation and physiological data indicate that network interactions (feed-forward, feedback, and lateral inhibition) alter contextual spike-timing relationships and may contribute substantially to improved information processing in the network, relative to single cells. We will examine the existence, origins, and consequences of these codes in both the simulated and biological eye. Specific Aim 2: Encoding of Light Intensity. Preliminary evidence indicates that an increase in light intensity produces an increase in both the rate and synchrony of type A photoreceptor spiking, suggesting multiple encoding schemes with potentially complementary roles. Further, the addition of synaptic and ionic neural ""noise"" improves both rate and synchrony encoding of light intensity. We propose to quantify and compare rate and contextual spike-timing codes across light intensities; examine how their performance is affected by the presence of neural noise; and implement relevant algorithms into a neural interface (or simulated interface) to determine whether they improve control of the system and light intensity encoding. Specific Aim 3: Contextual Spike-Timing Codes and Learning. Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements.

To that end, the project has three specific aims: 1) New probabilistic models of the neural code will be developed that exploit machine learning methods (Gibbs learning and boosting) and high performance computing resources. These models will represent the high dimensional probabilistic relationship between multiple behavioral variables and the firing activity of a population of neurons. 2) Neural decoding methods will be developed that model the uncertainty in neural recordings to make sound inferences that can drive neural prostheses. As part of this effort new probabilistic spike sorting algorithms will be developed and tested. 3) Adaptation of cells in the brain will be studied using the statistical models developed here and an understanding of this adaptation will be used to design new algorithms for prosthetic applications. These algorithms will themselves be adaptive in a way that optimizes prosthetic control in the face of a changing neural code. To learn such models from vast amounts of neural data, a new class of mathematical and computational tools is required. An interdisciplinary team including computer scientists, applied mathematicians, and neuroscientists will work in close concert to exploit existing infrastructure and experience with neural prostheses to address fundamental problems necessary for the practical application of these devices in humans. The coupling between the prosthesis application and basic research on neural coding provides a tight cycle of hypothesis, development, testing, and validation that will impact public health. n/a",CRCNS: Learning the Neural Code for Prosthetic Control,6935353,R01NS050967,"['action potentials', 'animal data', 'behavior test', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'electrodes', 'hippocampus', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'laboratory rat', 'limb movement', 'method development', 'model design /development', 'motor cortex', 'nervous system prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'statistics /biometry']",NINDS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,341237,0.00022236947665322135
"Development of a Bidirectional Brain Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have made it possible to move a robotic device in real time, using signals obtained directly from the brain. This field of Brain Machine Interface (BMI) has the means to provide movement for paralyzed patients, communication for locked-in patients, and a better understanding of the brain for all of society. In order to control movement effectively, the brain must be able to activate muscles appropriately, and monitor the evolving movement quickly and precisely. Existing BMIs for, while remarkable, do each of these tasks in poor imitation of the intact nervous system. Our proposed work addresses these limitations by developing a bidirectional interface that produces movement in a more natural way, and provides feedback about the movement by direct, electrical stimulation of the brain. Our partnership includes members at Northwestern Univ (NU), Univ of Chicago (UC), Univ of Mass, Amherst (UMass), and the autonomous Univ of Mexico (UNAM). Partners have advanced degrees in a range of biological science, computer science, physics, mathematics, and engineering disciplines. Miller (NU) will coordinate the partnership. He has extensive experience with a wide range of recording, stimulation and behavioral protocols in behaving monkeys. Hatsopoulos (UC) is at the forefront of the field of multi-electrode recordings.

"HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract): This study will develop an                                                                             automatic system for decomposing the electromyographic signal into the               constituent action potentials corresponding to the firing of individual motor        units activated by motorneurons. The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability. Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team. As part of this               application the enhanced system will be used in two laboratory studies and two       clinical studies. The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution. The clinical           studies will address the use of the device in quantifying the degree of              denervation in paralyzed laryngeal muscles and in studying the effect of acute       ataxia on the firing characteristics of the motorneurons in cerebellar stroke.

"FINGER COORDINATION IN ELDERLY Impairment of hand function with age is a major disabling factor limiting many activities of daily living.  A decrease in the hand dexterity may lead to a loss of independence and require external care during most everyday activities.  Our present understanding of the functioning of the human hand and changes in its function with age is limited.  This makes it imperative to perform studies directed at improved understanding of the hand function and its deterioration with age. Series of studies on control subjects and preliminary findings in a small group of elderly subjects have allowed us to formulate two major hypotheses: (a) Aging is associated with selective impairment of intrinsic hand muscles; and (b) Aging is associated with an increase in force deficit during multi-finger tasks.  The following research program has been elaborated for an analysis of possible contribution of these age-related changes to the loss of hand dexterity with age: (1) Confirmation of the preliminary conclusions using a larger subject population and a wider spectrum of tasks; (2) Analysis of the effects of these changes on crucial features of multi-finger synergies such as minimization of secondary moments and patterns of variability of individual finger forces (error compensation among fingers); (3) Analysis of possible changes in finger and hand coordination during more common actions such as gripping and bi-manual object handling; and (4) Analysis of correlations between changes in the indices of finger coordination and activities of daily living that involve hand function. Seven experiments on elderly and control subjects are suggested that include force production by sets of fingers in gripping and pressing tasks, self-imposed perturbations, and bi-manual object handling.  The research will combine noninvasive behavioral, biomechanical, electrophysiological, and modeling methods, as well as questionnaires.  In one experiment, the results will be compared with indices of the activities of daily living. Disprovable predictions are made for each experiment.  We believe that supporting or disproving the two main Hypotheses is important not only for a better understanding of age-related changes in hand muscle coordination but also for development of new rehabilitation approaches to hand function.  n/a",FINGER COORDINATION IN ELDERLY,6785858,R01AG018751,"['aging', 'artificial intelligence', 'body movement', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'hand', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'psychomotor function']",NIA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2004,231788,0.0036584496213596064
"Analysis & Control of Non-Synaptic Epileptiform Activity   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is characterized by the abnormal       synchronization of large numbers of neurons. The synchronization and                 propagation of epileptic seizures are thought to rely on synaptic transmission.      However, non-synaptic mechanisms such as neuronal swelling, electric field           effects, potassium diffusion, gap junctions and glial cell function also             contribute to the generation and spread of epileptiform activity. Non-synaptic       epilepsy is generated by lowering calcium in the extracellular space thereby         eliminating synaptic transmission. As a result, the clinical relevance of            non-synaptic mechanisms has been questioned. We have recently generated novel        models of non-synaptic activity in the presence of normal calcium and normal         synaptic transmission. We propose to analyze the role of non-synaptic                mechanisms in neuronal synchronization in order to understand and potentially        develop novel therapies to prevent abnormal neural activity. We have recently        shown that the frequency, amplitude and duration of non-synaptic epileptiform        events can be controlled independently suggesting that different mechanisms are      responsible. In particular, preliminary experiments show that gap junctions are      not responsible for the propagation of non-synaptic events generated in              zero-calcium medium, but that potassium diffusion (potentially mediated by the       activity of glial cells) plays a crucial role. The goal of this proposal is to       analyze and control non-synaptic epileptiform activity.                                                                                                                   Specifically, we propose to 1) determine the common mechanisms underlying three      models of non-synaptic epilepsy, 2) establish the conditions sufficient for the      generation of non-synaptic epileptogenesis, 3) analyze the mechanisms                underlying the propagation of non-synaptic epileptiform activity, 4) develop a       computer model of non-synaptic propagation to test hypotheses not directly           testable by experimentation, and 5) develop methods for controlling                  epileptiform activity. Multi-disciplinary experimental approaches such as            computer simulation and fluorescence imaging will be combined with pharmacology      and in-vitro slice electrophysiology to achieve these goals. Current                 therapeutic agents are not capable of controlling seizure activity in 25             percent of all epileptic patients. The results of our studies should provide         valuable insight into mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis as well as new           tools for the control and suppression of epileptic seizures.                                                                                                              n/a",Analysis & Control of Non-Synaptic Epileptiform Activity,6793142,R01NS040785,"['Animalia', 'artificial intelligence', 'brain electrical activity', 'cadmium', 'calcium', 'calcium channel', 'computer simulation', 'epilepsy', 'gap junctions', 'hippocampus', 'magnesium', 'model design /development', 'neuropharmacology', 'veratrum alkaloid', 'voltage /patch clamp']",NINDS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,229500,0.004261582025125502
"New Wavelet-based and Source Separation Methods for fMRI  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available methods of analysis for functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging offer a wealth of possibilities to researchers using this neuroimaging modality. However, these tools suffer from the inherent low signal to noise ratio of the data, and from the limitations of widely used model-based approaches. These problems have been addressed by the community and the literature now describes numerous methods that can remove part of the noise and extract brain activity pattern in a data-driven fashion. This project focuses on the design of optimized algorithms for the estimation and removal of the noise, on the understanding of the applicability of existing data-driven approaches, and on the development of new blind source separation methods for fMRI data. Particular attention will be given to quantification of the gains provided by the newly proposed methods by working on simulated datasets and specifically designed fMRI experiments. The first specific aim is to use a spatio-temporal four-dimensional multiresolution analysis to define an ""'ideal denoising"" scheme for a given study. It will make extensive use of the concept of best wavelet packet basis, which allows the most efficient representation of a signal. The concept wilt first be validated on fMRI rest datasets, and its efficiency will then be measured on simulated and actual data. The second specific aim focuses on blind source separation methods. An in depth study of Independent Component Analysis will be carried out to precisely define its field of applicability on fMRI data. By using sparsity together with time-frequency methods, we will develop new source separation algorithms and will demonstrate their robustness on both simulated and real data.   n/a",New Wavelet-based and Source Separation Methods for fMRI,6797879,R01MH067204,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'human subject', 'mathematics', 'phantom model', 'technology /technique development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,395000,0.004796300972432212
"Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to use neuroinformatics to help resolve the conflicting findings from which two models of olfactory coding have emerged. One model proposes that very many low-specificity neural responses represent each odorant and the other model suggests that fewer, more specific olfactory receptors bind to particular molecular features and that the combination of these specific responses characterizes each odorant. Since much of the data supporting the low-specificity model has been collected without regard for the exquisite spatial heterogeneity of the olfactory system, it is possible that the differences in conclusions could be resolved if the distinct types of data that are collected by various laboratories were placed into spatial register with one another. To that end, we have been building an archive of the spatial patterns of glomerular responses evoked by a wide range of odorants, and we have been able to test hypotheses regarding strategies of olfactory coding by calculating homologies across glomerular-layer response patterns. To facilitate our analytical task, and to make it feasible for others to place their data in register with this odorant response archive, we propose to continue to develop analytical and visualization software for olfactory bulb data. We also propose to extend this approach to both the olfactory epithelium and olfactory cortex to be able to understand both the initial coding and synthetic levels of the olfactory system.  These efforts will be freely available via the web site on which our olfactory activity archive is posted. We propose to improve the site by incorporating meta-data, as well as data from labs using other species and other types of data, such as lesions and neurophysiological data that can be located in space. Finally, the wide range of odorants that we must test to capture a sense of the system also will necessitate the use of an informatics approach to allow us to test hypotheses regarding the complex means by which chemical structure is represented in the system. The combination of these approaches should help resolve the differences between the conflicting models of olfactory coding. n/a",Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding,6803809,R01DC006516,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'bioinformatics', 'chemoreceptors', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'image processing', 'information retrieval', 'laboratory mouse', 'laboratory rat', 'mathematical model', 'meta analysis', 'neural information processing', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'olfactions', 'olfactory lobe', 'olfactory stimulus', 'respiratory epithelium', 'sensory mechanism', 'stimulus /response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE,R01,2004,20000,-0.0026058519579317875
"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks. The proposed studies therefore         represent the ability to study information processing of the cerebellum using        quite tractable motor behaviors and then to apply that information to more           complex cognitive processes. Thus, these studies will provide a basic                understanding of information processing for important aspects of the motor           system, and could provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of the           neural basis of information processing that is applied to cognitive properties       as well.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning,6741415,R01MH057051,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'behavioral extinction', 'biological models', 'brain electronic stimulator', 'cerebellar Purkinje cell', 'cerebellar nuclei', 'cerebellum', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'electrophysiology', 'eye movements', 'laboratory rabbit', 'learning', 'microelectrodes', 'neural information processing', 'neural plasticity', 'neural transmission', 'neurons', 'operant conditionings', 'psychomotor function', 'reflex', 'statistics /biometry', 'stimulus /response', 'synapses']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2004,222750,0.003262847196721656
"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,6792043,R21NS045410,"['Parkinson&apos', 's disease', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'electromyography', 'human subject', 'method development', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'psychomotor function', 'tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2004,153537,0.0048014626570607845
"Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a series of coordinated computational and electrophysiological studies to identify, analyze, and implement contextual spike-timing codes in the encoding of light intensity, using a well-understood, simple visual system (the Hermissenda eye) that permits detailed cellular mechanistic analyses and biologically realistic, Hodgkin- Huxley level simulations. We further propose to examine mechanisms by which neural ""noise"" paradoxically improves, rather than degrades, light intensity encoding; and the interactions of contextual spike-timing codes with learning-related synaptic plasticity. Implementation experiments to restore network function by explicitly introducing contextual spike-timing relationships may provide powerful, novel evidence regarding the functional consequences of these codes. Specific Aim 1: Role of Network Architecture. Pilot simulation and physiological data indicate that network interactions (feed-forward, feedback, and lateral inhibition) alter contextual spike-timing relationships and may contribute substantially to improved information processing in the network, relative to single cells. We will examine the existence, origins, and consequences of these codes in both the simulated and biological eye. Specific Aim 2: Encoding of Light Intensity. Preliminary evidence indicates that an increase in light intensity produces an increase in both the rate and synchrony of type A photoreceptor spiking, suggesting multiple encoding schemes with potentially complementary roles. Further, the addition of synaptic and ionic neural ""noise"" improves both rate and synchrony encoding of light intensity. We propose to quantify and compare rate and contextual spike-timing codes across light intensities; examine how their performance is affected by the presence of neural noise; and implement relevant algorithms into a neural interface (or simulated interface) to determine whether they improve control of the system and light intensity encoding. Specific Aim 3: Contextual Spike-Timing Codes and Learning. Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements. Taken together, these studies will elucidate neurobiological strategies for information processing, and identify efficient bio-based solutions that may be advantageously incorporated into artificial intelligence systems, robotic systems, or clinical neuroprostheses.         n/a",Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing,6768857,R01MH068392,"['Hermissenda', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'learning', 'light intensity', 'neural information processing', 'neural transmission', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory signal detection', 'visual feedback', 'visual perception', 'visual photoreceptor']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2004,201825,0.008402113248296216
"CRCNS: Learning the Neural Code for Prosthetic Control Current technology allows the simultaneous recording from hundreds of cells in the brains of awake behaving animals.

To that end, the project has three specific aims: 1) New probabilistic models of the neural code will be developed that exploit machine learning methods (Gibbs learning and boosting) and high performance computing resources. These models will represent the high dimensional probabilistic relationship between multiple behavioral variables and the firing activity of a population of neurons. 2) Neural decoding methods will be developed that model the uncertainty in neural recordings to make sound inferences that can drive neural prostheses. As part of this effort new probabilistic spike sorting algorithms will be developed and tested. 3) Adaptation of cells in the brain will be studied using the statistical models developed here and an understanding of this adaptation will be used to design new algorithms for prosthetic applications. These algorithms will themselves be adaptive in a way that optimizes prosthetic control in the face of a changing neural code. To learn such models from vast amounts of neural data, a new class of mathematical and computational tools is required.

Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team. As part of this               application the enhanced system will be used in two laboratory studies and two       clinical studies. The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution. The clinical           studies will address the use of the device in quantifying the degree of              denervation in paralyzed laryngeal muscles and in studying the effect of acute       ataxia on the firing characteristics of the motorneurons in cerebellar stroke.       As well as testing specific hypotheses, these studies will be used to test and       improve the evolving design of the new decomposition system.                                                                                                              n/a",HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC,6642050,R24HD038585,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biological signal transduction', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' electromyography', ' evaluation /testing', ' human subject', ' motor neurons', ' neuromuscular function']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY,R24,2003,562596,-0.02267053282274945
"Spinal Cord Injury: Automatic Scoring of Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disorders of motor function due to accidental injury, stroke and neurodegenerative disorders, together with disorders of mental health, are the most crippling human ailments. One common result of mechanical insult is spinal cord injury (SCI), in which damage of the spinal cord by contusion, compression or laceration causes loss of sensation, motor and reflex function below the point of injury. Other symptoms of SCI may include bowel and bladder dysfunction, hyperalgesia and sexual dysfunction. Although many SCI patients survive injury, major chronic dysfunction is the most common outcome. There are approximately 10,000 new cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) in the U.S each year. In contrast to the relatively small acute patient population, chronic SCI, involving approximately 200,000-250,000 people in this country, is extremely expensive to society, both in terms of human and economic costs. Because most SCI victims are under age 30 at the time of their injury, and most now live a near-normal life span, direct medical costs average $2 million per patient over a lifetime, and approximately $5 billion total per year in the US only. Therefore, any   drug or intervention that can positively improve the quality of life of patients suffering from SCI is likely to have a greater financial impact than would be expected simply from the cost of acute injury each year.  Animal models for SCI and other conditions that affect gait and motor coordination are successfully used today to develop new treatments. Assessing the level of motor dysfunction in an animal model is a difficult challenge as most researchers rely on the subjective scoring of symptoms. We propose here to build a system that will allow a more objective, faster and consistent assessment of the level of injury and course of recovery in rat and mouse models of SCI that can be applied in the future to other gait and motor coordination disorders. An artificial intelligent system based on computer vision will be developed to capture and score gait and motor coordination in rodents and will be validated against the standard scores of motor function obtained using the methods of Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (1995) for the rat model of SCI.         n/a",Spinal Cord Injury: Automatic Scoring of Motor Function,6695163,R43NS046980,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' gait', ' laboratory rat', ' limb movement', ' psychomotor function', ' spinal cord injury']",NINDS,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2003,234554,-0.005584685838634612
"Embedded Tools for Processing Neural Ensembles DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-electrode recording from ensembles of neurons in awake, behaving animals is a central technique for understanding the neural basis of behavior and nervous systems disorders, and a prerequisite to the creation of neural-controlled prostheses. However, for these techniques to reach their full potential for processing neural data in real time, there are both computational and the hardware barriers to be overcome.  The overall goal of this project is to provide software and hardware tools for overcoming these barriers and to encourage significant advances in multi-electrode recordings. Phase I will design a fast spike-sorting algorithm for real-time use, embed critical portions in reprogrammable hardware (FPGAs), and construct an overall plug-and-play architecture that integrates FPGA capabilities and includes a high-level FPGA compiler.  Phase II will produce a beta version of Neural Arts' Chorus Recording System that incorporates software and hardware designed in Phase I. The software and hardware resulting from this project will give researchers the first real-time processing platform using reprogrammable FPGAs that is low-cost, lightweight, and can take full advantage of multi-wire electrodes and advanced spike sorting algorithms.  The principal scientific benefit of this research will be to make possible significantly more powerful real-time systems for use with awake, behaving animals. The principal health-related benefit will be to facilitate increased understanding of neural functioning and disorders, and to provide a development platform for accelerated progress toward neural-controlled prostheses.

"FINGER COORDINATION IN ELDERLY Impairment of hand function with age is a major disabling factor limiting many activities of daily living.  A decrease in the hand dexterity may lead to a loss of independence and require external care during most everyday activities.  Our present understanding of the functioning of the human hand and changes in its function with age is limited.  This makes it imperative to perform studies directed at improved understanding of the hand function and its deterioration with age. Series of studies on control subjects and preliminary findings in a small group of elderly subjects have allowed us to formulate two major hypotheses: (a) Aging is associated with selective impairment of intrinsic hand muscles; and (b) Aging is associated with an increase in force deficit during multi-finger tasks.  The following research program has been elaborated for an analysis of possible contribution of these age-related changes to the loss of hand dexterity with age: (1) Confirmation of the preliminary conclusions using a larger subject population and a wider spectrum of tasks; (2) Analysis of the effects of these changes on crucial features of multi-finger synergies such as minimization of secondary moments and patterns of variability of individual finger forces (error compensation among fingers); (3) Analysis of possible changes in finger and hand coordination during more common actions such as gripping and bi-manual object handling; and (4) Analysis of correlations between changes in the indices of finger coordination and activities of daily living that involve hand function. Seven experiments on elderly and control subjects are suggested that include force production by sets of fingers in gripping and pressing tasks, self-imposed perturbations, and bi-manual object handling.  The research will combine noninvasive behavioral, biomechanical, electrophysiological, and modeling methods, as well as questionnaires.  In one experiment, the results will be compared with indices of the activities of daily living. Disprovable predictions are made for each experiment.  We believe that supporting or disproving the two main Hypotheses is important not only for a better understanding of age-related changes in hand muscle coordination but also for development of new rehabilitation approaches to hand function.  n/a",FINGER COORDINATION IN ELDERLY,6637831,R01AG018751,"['aging', ' artificial intelligence', ' body movement', ' clinical research', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' hand', ' human old age (65+)', ' human subject', ' psychomotor function']",NIA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2003,231899,0.0036584496213596064
"Analysis & Control of Non-Synaptic Epileptiform Activity   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is characterized by the abnormal       synchronization of large numbers of neurons. The synchronization and                 propagation of epileptic seizures are thought to rely on synaptic transmission.      However, non-synaptic mechanisms such as neuronal swelling, electric field           effects, potassium diffusion, gap junctions and glial cell function also             contribute to the generation and spread of epileptiform activity. Non-synaptic       epilepsy is generated by lowering calcium in the extracellular space thereby         eliminating synaptic transmission. As a result, the clinical relevance of            non-synaptic mechanisms has been questioned. We have recently generated novel        models of non-synaptic activity in the presence of normal calcium and normal         synaptic transmission. We propose to analyze the role of non-synaptic                mechanisms in neuronal synchronization in order to understand and potentially        develop novel therapies to prevent abnormal neural activity. We have recently        shown that the frequency, amplitude and duration of non-synaptic epileptiform        events can be controlled independently suggesting that different mechanisms are      responsible. In particular, preliminary experiments show that gap junctions are      not responsible for the propagation of non-synaptic events generated in              zero-calcium medium, but that potassium diffusion (potentially mediated by the       activity of glial cells) plays a crucial role. The goal of this proposal is to       analyze and control non-synaptic epileptiform activity.                                                                                                                   Specifically, we propose to 1) determine the common mechanisms underlying three      models of non-synaptic epilepsy, 2) establish the conditions sufficient for the      generation of non-synaptic epileptogenesis, 3) analyze the mechanisms                underlying the propagation of non-synaptic epileptiform activity, 4) develop a       computer model of non-synaptic propagation to test hypotheses not directly           testable by experimentation, and 5) develop methods for controlling                  epileptiform activity. Multi-disciplinary experimental approaches such as            computer simulation and fluorescence imaging will be combined with pharmacology      and in-vitro slice electrophysiology to achieve these goals. Current                 therapeutic agents are not capable of controlling seizure activity in 25             percent of all epileptic patients. The results of our studies should provide         valuable insight into mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis as well as new           tools for the control and suppression of epileptic seizures.                                                                                                              n/a",Analysis & Control of Non-Synaptic Epileptiform Activity,6650167,R01NS040785,"['Animalia', ' artificial intelligence', ' brain electrical activity', ' cadmium', ' calcium', ' calcium channel', ' computer simulation', ' epilepsy', ' gap junctions', ' hippocampus', ' magnesium', ' model design /development', ' neuropharmacology', ' veratrum alkaloid', ' voltage /patch clamp']",NINDS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2003,229500,0.004261582025125502
"New Wavelet-based and Source Separation Methods for fMRI  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available methods of analysis for functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging offer a wealth of possibilities to researchers using this neuroimaging modality. However, these tools suffer from the inherent low signal to noise ratio of the data, and from the limitations of widely used model-based approaches. These problems have been addressed by the community and the literature now describes numerous methods that can remove part of the noise and extract brain activity pattern in a data-driven fashion. This project focuses on the design of optimized algorithms for the estimation and removal of the noise, on the understanding of the applicability of existing data-driven approaches, and on the development of new blind source separation methods for fMRI data. Particular attention will be given to quantification of the gains provided by the newly proposed methods by working on simulated datasets and specifically designed fMRI experiments. The first specific aim is to use a spatio-temporal four-dimensional multiresolution analysis to define an ""'ideal denoising"" scheme for a given study. It will make extensive use of the concept of best wavelet packet basis, which allows the most efficient representation of a signal. The concept wilt first be validated on fMRI rest datasets, and its efficiency will then be measured on simulated and actual data. The second specific aim focuses on blind source separation methods. An in depth study of Independent Component Analysis will be carried out to precisely define its field of applicability on fMRI data. By using sparsity together with time-frequency methods, we will develop new source separation algorithms and will demonstrate their robustness on both simulated and real data.   n/a",New Wavelet-based and Source Separation Methods for fMRI,6663283,R01MH067204,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' brain imaging /visualization /scanning', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging', ' human subject', ' mathematics', ' phantom model', ' technology /technique development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2003,395000,0.004796300972432212
"STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              This is an application for a KO2 Independent Scientist Award. The candidate is       an anesthesiologist/statistician whose research to date has focused on the           development of statistical models for the quantitative study of how neural           systems represent and transmit information the central focus of his career           research. The study of how neural systems encode information is one of the most      challenging and fascinating problems in science. The point process character of      neural spike trains means that standard signal processing techniques developed       to analyze continuous signals will have limited application in the analysis of       neural systems. The study of neural signal processing requires the development       of new quantitative techniques to accurately characterize the properties of          neural systems. These methods should be developed in close collaboration with        experimentalists to ensure that the models remain completely faithful to the         neurophysiology. For this reason, the candidate will collaborate with Professor      Matt Wilson in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT. The             research will use Professor Wilson's paradigm of simultaneous multiunit              recordings of pyramidal (place) cells in the hippocampus of freely behaving          rodents to model, how these neurons encode spatial information as the animals        perform specific behavioral tasks. The statistical methods to be developed will      be based on spatio-temporal point process models of hippocampal place cell           spiking activity and nonlinear recursive filtering algorithms based on Bayesian      statistical theory. The experimental work in this project will be carried out        in Professor Wilson's laboratory at MIT and is an integral part of his research      on characterizing the role of the hippocampus in short- and long-term memory         formation. The methodology research will be conducted in parallel at the             candidate's laboratory in the Department of Anesthesia at Massachusetts General      Hospital. The candidate will use the additional funded research time provided        by KO2 award to enhance his knowledge of hippocampus physiology and anatomy and      to develop a sound theoretical framework based on theory of point processes          from which to derive signal processing methods appropriate for neural systems.       The candidate's long-term objectives are to continue his work on neural              information processing and the study of the hippocampus in memory formation.         The research to be undertaken in this project will also provide a set of             statistical tools with which neuroscientists will be able to study information       representation and transmission in neural systems using multiunit activity data      recorded along with relevant biological signals.                                                                                                                          n/a",STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING,6639188,K02MH061637,"['NMDA receptors', ' action potentials', ' animal data', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' computational neuroscience', ' electroencephalography', ' entorhinal cortex', ' environment', ' hippocampus', ' long term memory', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' pyramidal cells', ' short term memory', ' sleep', ' space perception', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K02,2003,123541,0.007766201657398624
"Neurological Control During Brain Recording  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research proposal aims to investigate the optimal design features of intracortical motor neuroprosthetics by analyzing: 1) The ability of specific algorithms to predict movements from neural activity, 2) the ability of non-human primate subjects to control neurally-derived signals in a behaviorally useful way, and 3) explore the abilities of humans to control computer cursors with neural activity. First, discrete and continuous movement models will be evaluated to determine the minimum amount of data necessary to build robust decoders. This relates to clinical calibration: How much time will be required for patients to build decoding models that they can then use? Next, I will evaluate if and how animals can control a computer cursor whose position is driven by decoded neural activity alone: Whether they can generate stationary holds, ballistic reaches, and complex trajectories. Finally, I will test the decoding system in humans by participating in ongoing human multi-electrode recording. I hope to implement a real-time neural activity decoding system to test whether human subjects can rapidly acquire useful, accurate control over a movement signal. These investigations will shed light on which parameters are useful for achieving such control and yield insight on the optimal balance between computer and human learning in the closed-loop control system to restore maximum functional independence.   n/a",Neurological Control During Brain Recording,6583494,F31NS045460,"['Macaca', ' artificial intelligence', ' assistive device /technology', ' behavior test', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' biomechanics', ' clinical research', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' electrodes', ' functional ability', ' goal oriented behavior', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' medical rehabilitation related tag', ' nervous system prosthesis', ' neurophysiology', ' neuroregulation', ' predoctoral investigator']",NINDS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,F31,2003,37017,0.013540958319846962
"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks. The proposed studies therefore         represent the ability to study information processing of the cerebellum using        quite tractable motor behaviors and then to apply that information to more           complex cognitive processes. Thus, these studies will provide a basic                understanding of information processing for important aspects of the motor           system, and could provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of the           neural basis of information processing that is applied to cognitive properties       as well.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning,6639065,R01MH057051,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral extinction', ' biological models', ' brain electronic stimulator', ' cerebellar Purkinje cell', ' cerebellar nuclei', ' cerebellum', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' electrophysiology', ' eye movements', ' laboratory rabbit', ' learning', ' microelectrodes', ' neural information processing', ' neural plasticity', ' neural transmission', ' neurons', ' operant conditionings', ' psychomotor function', ' reflex', ' statistics /biometry', ' stimulus /response', ' synapses']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2003,223063,0.003262847196721656
"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,6688775,R21NS045410,"[""Parkinson's disease"", ' abnormal involuntary movement', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' electromyography', ' human subject', ' method development', ' neuromuscular disorder', ' psychomotor function', ' tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2003,178485,0.0048014626570607845
"DYNAMIC PATTERN ANALYSIS OF RETINAL FUNCTION   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract): The goal of the proposed work                               is to understand retinal processing through a careful analysis of the dynamic        (space-time) patterns of activity that are generated at each retinal level. The      spatiotemporal patterns will be generated in two complementary ways: (1)             patterns will be measured and constructed through a novel method of                  physiological recording of excitation and inhibition over a large region for         every cell type at each retinal level and extending the result to a population       of that cell type, and (2) the patterns will be generated as the emergent            properties of retinal models constructed by incorporating the space, time            pharmacological and morphological properties derived from single cell studies.       The measured and modeled patterns will be compared to evaluate the quantitative      hypothesis of retinal embodied in the model.

"Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a series of coordinated computational and electrophysiological studies to identify, analyze, and implement contextual spike-timing codes in the encoding of light intensity, using a well-understood, simple visual system (the Hermissenda eye) that permits detailed cellular mechanistic analyses and biologically realistic, Hodgkin- Huxley level simulations. We further propose to examine mechanisms by which neural ""noise"" paradoxically improves, rather than degrades, light intensity encoding; and the interactions of contextual spike-timing codes with learning-related synaptic plasticity. Implementation experiments to restore network function by explicitly introducing contextual spike-timing relationships may provide powerful, novel evidence regarding the functional consequences of these codes. Specific Aim 1: Role of Network Architecture. Pilot simulation and physiological data indicate that network interactions (feed-forward, feedback, and lateral inhibition) alter contextual spike-timing relationships and may contribute substantially to improved information processing in the network, relative to single cells. We will examine the existence, origins, and consequences of these codes in both the simulated and biological eye. Specific Aim 2: Encoding of Light Intensity. Preliminary evidence indicates that an increase in light intensity produces an increase in both the rate and synchrony of type A photoreceptor spiking, suggesting multiple encoding schemes with potentially complementary roles. Further, the addition of synaptic and ionic neural ""noise"" improves both rate and synchrony encoding of light intensity. We propose to quantify and compare rate and contextual spike-timing codes across light intensities; examine how their performance is affected by the presence of neural noise; and implement relevant algorithms into a neural interface (or simulated interface) to determine whether they improve control of the system and light intensity encoding. Specific Aim 3: Contextual Spike-Timing Codes and Learning. Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements. Taken together, these studies will elucidate neurobiological strategies for information processing, and identify efficient bio-based solutions that may be advantageously incorporated into artificial intelligence systems, robotic systems, or clinical neuroprostheses.         n/a",Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing,6671314,R01MH068392,"['Hermissenda', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' learning', ' light intensity', ' neural information processing', ' neural transmission', ' sensory discrimination', ' sensory signal detection', ' visual feedback', ' visual perception', ' visual photoreceptor']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2003,229705,0.008402113248296216

"FINGER COORDINATION IN ELDERLY Impairment of hand function with age is a major disabling factor limiting many activities of daily living.  A decrease in the hand dexterity may lead to a loss of independence and require external care during most everyday activities.  Our present understanding of the functioning of the human hand and changes in its function with age is limited.  This makes it imperative to perform studies directed at improved understanding of the hand function and its deterioration with age. Series of studies on control subjects and preliminary findings in a small group of elderly subjects have allowed us to formulate two major hypotheses: (a) Aging is associated with selective impairment of intrinsic hand muscles; and (b) Aging is associated with an increase in force deficit during multi-finger tasks.  The following research program has been elaborated for an analysis of possible contribution of these age-related changes to the loss of hand dexterity with age: (1) Confirmation of the preliminary conclusions using a larger subject population and a wider spectrum of tasks; (2) Analysis of the effects of these changes on crucial features of multi-finger synergies such as minimization of secondary moments and patterns of variability of individual finger forces (error compensation among fingers); (3) Analysis of possible changes in finger and hand coordination during more common actions such as gripping and bi-manual object handling; and (4) Analysis of correlations between changes in the indices of finger coordination and activities of daily living that involve hand function. Seven experiments on elderly and control subjects are suggested that include force production by sets of fingers in gripping and pressing tasks, self-imposed perturbations, and bi-manual object handling.  The research will combine noninvasive behavioral, biomechanical, electrophysiological, and modeling methods, as well as questionnaires.  In one experiment, the results will be compared with indices of the activities of daily living. Disprovable predictions are made for each experiment.  We believe that supporting or disproving the two main Hypotheses is important not only for a better understanding of age-related changes in hand muscle coordination but also for development of new rehabilitation approaches to hand function.  n/a",FINGER COORDINATION IN ELDERLY,6533901,R01AG018751,"['aging', ' artificial intelligence', ' body movement', ' clinical research', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' hand', ' human old age (65+)', ' human subject', ' psychomotor function']",NIA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2002,232006,0.0036584496213596064
"Analysis & Control of Non-Synaptic Epileptiform Activity   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is characterized by the abnormal       synchronization of large numbers of neurons. The synchronization and                 propagation of epileptic seizures are thought to rely on synaptic transmission.      However, non-synaptic mechanisms such as neuronal swelling, electric field           effects, potassium diffusion, gap junctions and glial cell function also             contribute to the generation and spread of epileptiform activity. Non-synaptic       epilepsy is generated by lowering calcium in the extracellular space thereby         eliminating synaptic transmission. As a result, the clinical relevance of            non-synaptic mechanisms has been questioned. We have recently generated novel        models of non-synaptic activity in the presence of normal calcium and normal         synaptic transmission. We propose to analyze the role of non-synaptic                mechanisms in neuronal synchronization in order to understand and potentially        develop novel therapies to prevent abnormal neural activity. We have recently        shown that the frequency, amplitude and duration of non-synaptic epileptiform        events can be controlled independently suggesting that different mechanisms are      responsible. In particular, preliminary experiments show that gap junctions are      not responsible for the propagation of non-synaptic events generated in              zero-calcium medium, but that potassium diffusion (potentially mediated by the       activity of glial cells) plays a crucial role. The goal of this proposal is to       analyze and control non-synaptic epileptiform activity.                                                                                                                   Specifically, we propose to 1) determine the common mechanisms underlying three      models of non-synaptic epilepsy, 2) establish the conditions sufficient for the      generation of non-synaptic epileptogenesis, 3) analyze the mechanisms                underlying the propagation of non-synaptic epileptiform activity, 4) develop a       computer model of non-synaptic propagation to test hypotheses not directly           testable by experimentation, and 5) develop methods for controlling                  epileptiform activity. Multi-disciplinary experimental approaches such as            computer simulation and fluorescence imaging will be combined with pharmacology      and in-vitro slice electrophysiology to achieve these goals. Current                 therapeutic agents are not capable of controlling seizure activity in 25             percent of all epileptic patients. The results of our studies should provide         valuable insight into mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis as well as new           tools for the control and suppression of epileptic seizures.                                                                                                              n/a",Analysis & Control of Non-Synaptic Epileptiform Activity,6529645,R01NS040785,"['Animalia', ' artificial intelligence', ' brain electrical activity', ' cadmium', ' calcium', ' calcium channel', ' computer simulation', ' epilepsy', ' gap junctions', ' hippocampus', ' magnesium', ' model design /development', ' neuropharmacology', ' veratrum alkaloid', ' voltage /patch clamp']",NINDS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2002,229500,0.004261582025125502
"Continuous Digital Video Behavioral Analysis of Rats  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The behavioral components of electrographic seizures in rodents, primarily rats and mice, are generally used as the most fundamental basis for the presence of epileptic seizures. Numerous research grants use analysis of animal seizures as a fundamental component of the research, even research aimed at molecular and cellular mechanisms. The abnormal behaviors during a motor seizure are generally distinctive, but a certain degree of subjectivity is present from one laboratory to another. With the development of sophisticated electrodes for multiple recordings and the availability of radiotelemetry systems, the potential to combine automated studies of seizure behavior and electrographic seizure activity is now possible. We propose to develop and validate behavioral algorithms for identifying, classifying and quantifying the motor components of different types of seizures in mice and rats using digital video technology. We will define the behavioral components of different classes of seizures, and to do this in conjunction with electrographic seizures from EEG recordings. These behaviors will include but not be limited to unilateral and bilateral forelimb clonus and the assumption of a lordotic posture, with a characteristic positioning of the tail. A system that allows combined analysis of EEG and behavior will be fully developed to meet the demand from research laboratories at universities and pharmaceutical companies.   n/a",Continuous Digital Video Behavioral Analysis of Rats,6549823,R43DA015571,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' body movement', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' digital imaging', ' drug addiction', ' electron optics', ' ethology', ' laboratory rat', ' nicotine', ' posture', ' psychometrics', ' self medication', ' video recording system', ' videotape /videodisc']",NIDA,"CLEVER SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2002,113671,-0.015231054373001556
"New Wavelet-based and Source Separation Methods for fMRI  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available methods of analysis for functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging offer a wealth of possibilities to researchers using this neuroimaging modality. However, these tools suffer from the inherent low signal to noise ratio of the data, and from the limitations of widely used model-based approaches. These problems have been addressed by the community and the literature now describes numerous methods that can remove part of the noise and extract brain activity pattern in a data-driven fashion. This project focuses on the design of optimized algorithms for the estimation and removal of the noise, on the understanding of the applicability of existing data-driven approaches, and on the development of new blind source separation methods for fMRI data. Particular attention will be given to quantification of the gains provided by the newly proposed methods by working on simulated datasets and specifically designed fMRI experiments. The first specific aim is to use a spatio-temporal four-dimensional multiresolution analysis to define an ""'ideal denoising"" scheme for a given study. It will make extensive use of the concept of best wavelet packet basis, which allows the most efficient representation of a signal. The concept wilt first be validated on fMRI rest datasets, and its efficiency will then be measured on simulated and actual data. The second specific aim focuses on blind source separation methods. An in depth study of Independent Component Analysis will be carried out to precisely define its field of applicability on fMRI data. By using sparsity together with time-frequency methods, we will develop new source separation algorithms and will demonstrate their robustness on both simulated and real data.   n/a",New Wavelet-based and Source Separation Methods for fMRI,6554738,R01MH067204,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' brain imaging /visualization /scanning', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging', ' human subject', ' mathematics', ' method development', ' phantom model', ' technology /technique development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2002,395000,0.004796300972432212
"STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              This is an application for a KO2 Independent Scientist Award. The candidate is       an anesthesiologist/statistician whose research to date has focused on the           development of statistical models for the quantitative study of how neural           systems represent and transmit information the central focus of his career           research. The study of how neural systems encode information is one of the most      challenging and fascinating problems in science. The point process character of      neural spike trains means that standard signal processing techniques developed       to analyze continuous signals will have limited application in the analysis of       neural systems. The study of neural signal processing requires the development       of new quantitative techniques to accurately characterize the properties of          neural systems. These methods should be developed in close collaboration with        experimentalists to ensure that the models remain completely faithful to the         neurophysiology. For this reason, the candidate will collaborate with Professor      Matt Wilson in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT. The             research will use Professor Wilson's paradigm of simultaneous multiunit              recordings of pyramidal (place) cells in the hippocampus of freely behaving          rodents to model, how these neurons encode spatial information as the animals        perform specific behavioral tasks. The statistical methods to be developed will      be based on spatio-temporal point process models of hippocampal place cell           spiking activity and nonlinear recursive filtering algorithms based on Bayesian      statistical theory. The experimental work in this project will be carried out        in Professor Wilson's laboratory at MIT and is an integral part of his research      on characterizing the role of the hippocampus in short- and long-term memory         formation. The methodology research will be conducted in parallel at the             candidate's laboratory in the Department of Anesthesia at Massachusetts General      Hospital. The candidate will use the additional funded research time provided        by KO2 award to enhance his knowledge of hippocampus physiology and anatomy and      to develop a sound theoretical framework based on theory of point processes          from which to derive signal processing methods appropriate for neural systems.       The candidate's long-term objectives are to continue his work on neural              information processing and the study of the hippocampus in memory formation.         The research to be undertaken in this project will also provide a set of             statistical tools with which neuroscientists will be able to study information       representation and transmission in neural systems using multiunit activity data      recorded along with relevant biological signals.                                                                                                                          n/a",STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING,6539118,K02MH061637,"['NMDA receptors', ' action potentials', ' animal data', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' computational neuroscience', ' electroencephalography', ' entorhinal cortex', ' environment', ' hippocampus', ' long term memory', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' pyramidal cells', ' short term memory', ' sleep', ' space perception', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K02,2002,123541,0.007766201657398624
"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks. The proposed studies therefore         represent the ability to study information processing of the cerebellum using        quite tractable motor behaviors and then to apply that information to more           complex cognitive processes. Thus, these studies will provide a basic                understanding of information processing for important aspects of the motor           system, and could provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of the           neural basis of information processing that is applied to cognitive properties       as well.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning,6538783,R01MH057051,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral extinction', ' biological models', ' brain electronic stimulator', ' cerebellar Purkinje cell', ' cerebellar nuclei', ' cerebellum', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' electrophysiology', ' eye movements', ' laboratory rabbit', ' learning', ' microelectrodes', ' neural information processing', ' neural plasticity', ' neural transmission', ' neurons', ' operant conditionings', ' psychomotor function', ' reflex', ' statistics /biometry', ' stimulus /response', ' synapses']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2002,223813,0.003262847196721656
"DYNAMIC PATTERN ANALYSIS OF RETINAL FUNCTION   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract): The goal of the proposed work                               is to understand retinal processing through a careful analysis of the dynamic        (space-time) patterns of activity that are generated at each retinal level. The      spatiotemporal patterns will be generated in two complementary ways: (1)             patterns will be measured and constructed through a novel method of                  physiological recording of excitation and inhibition over a large region for         every cell type at each retinal level and extending the result to a population       of that cell type, and (2) the patterns will be generated as the emergent            properties of retinal models constructed by incorporating the space, time            pharmacological and morphological properties derived from single cell studies.       The measured and modeled patterns will be compared to evaluate the quantitative      hypothesis of retinal embodied in the model. The modeling infrastructure, the        Cellular Neural Network, (CNN) is now well-established massively parallel            analog array processor designed with an architecture quite similar to the            vertebrate retina.

"Artificial Neural Network modelling for studying posture A major challenge with the application of artificial neural network (ANN) modeling in examining the motor-sensory relation in postural control is that the neural synaptic weights that relate the inputs to the outputs of the ANN are chaotic in nature. In an earlier study through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and experimental tests, the PI and her colleague have found that these weights are interdependent. The product of these weights is a statistically stable variable and can be used to quantify the input-output relation of the ANN, called Q value. The objective of this proposed research is to extend the above work to the area of human postural control. Specifically, we will explore whether or not a Q value concept in an ANN can be used to quantify the motor-sensory relation in a classical postural control task - maintaining upright balance when the supporting base is suddenly rotated in a toes up direction. We will construct an ANN model that includes two outputs and seven inputs. The two outputs are the EMG signals from ankle dorsiflexor and plantartlexor in response to the onset of the supporting base rotation. The seven inputs are average eye-target distance (distance from eye center to a visual target), head acceleration (both linear and angular), ankle joint rotation, ankle joint rotation speed, and ground reaction forces (both normal and shear) under feet. These inputs represent the mechanical stimulation to the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems, respectively. These inputs and outputs variables will be measured directly from two groups of elderly subjects: peripherally neuropathic and normal, non-peripherally neuropathic. We will then determine the weights in the ANN model by a backward-propagation training routine, and the corresponding Q values relating each output to each of the inputs. We will statistically compare the Q values among the multiple sensory inputs within each group. We hypothesize that under this experimental condition, the Q values relating postural muscle activities to the somatosensory inputs would be: (1) significantly higher than the Q values relating to other sensory inputs (such as visual and vestibular inputs) in normal, non-neuropathic subjects; and (2) significantly lower than the Q values relating to other sensory inputs in neuropathic subjects. It is hoped that this study will contribute to our understanding of how sensory information is used to control postural muscle activities, and how a modification in the motor-sensory relation can result in increased postural stability or falls.  n/a",Artificial Neural Network modelling for studying posture,6400894,R03AG019872,"['artificial intelligence', ' balance', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' posture', ' psychomotor function', ' somesthetic sensory cortex', ' vestibular pathway', ' visual pathways']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R03,2001,75500,0.008515699528338742
"FINGER COORDINATION IN ELDERLY Impairment of hand function with age is a major disabling factor limiting many activities of daily living.  A decrease in the hand dexterity may lead to a loss of independence and require external care during most everyday activities.  Our present understanding of the functioning of the human hand and changes in its function with age is limited.  This makes it imperative to perform studies directed at improved understanding of the hand function and its deterioration with age. Series of studies on control subjects and preliminary findings in a small group of elderly subjects have allowed us to formulate two major hypotheses: (a) Aging is associated with selective impairment of intrinsic hand muscles; and (b) Aging is associated with an increase in force deficit during multi-finger tasks.  The following research program has been elaborated for an analysis of possible contribution of these age-related changes to the loss of hand dexterity with age: (1) Confirmation of the preliminary conclusions using a larger subject population and a wider spectrum of tasks; (2) Analysis of the effects of these changes on crucial features of multi-finger synergies such as minimization of secondary moments and patterns of variability of individual finger forces (error compensation among fingers); (3) Analysis of possible changes in finger and hand coordination during more common actions such as gripping and bi-manual object handling; and (4) Analysis of correlations between changes in the indices of finger coordination and activities of daily living that involve hand function. Seven experiments on elderly and control subjects are suggested that include force production by sets of fingers in gripping and pressing tasks, self-imposed perturbations, and bi-manual object handling.  The research will combine noninvasive behavioral, biomechanical, electrophysiological, and modeling methods, as well as questionnaires.  In one experiment, the results will be compared with indices of the activities of daily living. Disprovable predictions are made for each experiment.  We believe that supporting or disproving the two main Hypotheses is important not only for a better understanding of age-related changes in hand muscle coordination but also for development of new rehabilitation approaches to hand function.  n/a",FINGER COORDINATION IN ELDERLY,6369619,R01AG018751,"['aging', ' artificial intelligence', ' body movement', ' clinical research', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' hand', ' human old age (65+)', ' human subject', ' psychomotor function']",NIA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2001,308867,0.0036584496213596064
"Analysis & Control of NonSynaptic Epileptiform Activity   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is characterized by the abnormal       synchronization of large numbers of neurons. The synchronization and                 propagation of epileptic seizures are thought to rely on synaptic transmission.      However, non-synaptic mechanisms such as neuronal swelling, electric field           effects, potassium diffusion, gap junctions and glial cell function also             contribute to the generation and spread of epileptiform activity. Non-synaptic       epilepsy is generated by lowering calcium in the extracellular space thereby         eliminating synaptic transmission. As a result, the clinical relevance of            non-synaptic mechanisms has been questioned. We have recently generated novel        models of non-synaptic activity in the presence of normal calcium and normal         synaptic transmission. We propose to analyze the role of non-synaptic                mechanisms in neuronal synchronization in order to understand and potentially        develop novel therapies to prevent abnormal neural activity. We have recently        shown that the frequency, amplitude and duration of non-synaptic epileptiform        events can be controlled independently suggesting that different mechanisms are      responsible. In particular, preliminary experiments show that gap junctions are      not responsible for the propagation of non-synaptic events generated in              zero-calcium medium, but that potassium diffusion (potentially mediated by the       activity of glial cells) plays a crucial role. The goal of this proposal is to       analyze and control non-synaptic epileptiform activity.                                                                                                                   Specifically, we propose to 1) determine the common mechanisms underlying three      models of non-synaptic epilepsy, 2) establish the conditions sufficient for the      generation of non-synaptic epileptogenesis, 3) analyze the mechanisms                underlying the propagation of non-synaptic epileptiform activity, 4) develop a       computer model of non-synaptic propagation to test hypotheses not directly           testable by experimentation, and 5) develop methods for controlling                  epileptiform activity. Multi-disciplinary experimental approaches such as            computer simulation and fluorescence imaging will be combined with pharmacology      and in-vitro slice electrophysiology to achieve these goals. Current                 therapeutic agents are not capable of controlling seizure activity in 25             percent of all epileptic patients. The results of our studies should provide         valuable insight into mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis as well as new           tools for the control and suppression of epileptic seizures.                                                                                                              n/a",Analysis & Control of NonSynaptic Epileptiform Activity,6383308,R01NS040785,"['Animalia', ' artificial intelligence', ' brain electrical activity', ' cadmium', ' calcium', ' calcium channel', ' computer simulation', ' epilepsy', ' gap junctions', ' hippocampus', ' magnesium', ' model design /development', ' neuropharmacology', ' veratrum alkaloid', ' voltage /patch clamp']",NINDS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,224388,0.004261582025125502

This RCA will permit the PI to devote nearly full time      to research.                                                                                                                                                      Short term goals are to test the hypothesis that neuronal ensembles have         nonlinear deterministic properties.  If so, they will 1) have activity that      can be characterized and controlled through unstable periodic orbits, 2)         hen noise driven will exhibit stochastic resonance, and 3) because of            coupling will exhibit generalized (nonlinear) synchrony and emergence.           Long-term goals are to achieve a better understanding of neuronal network        and brain behavior, and to develop novel methods of treating dynamical           diseases.                                                                                                                                                         The research project will involve theoretical work on the detection of           unstable orbits in In Vitro brain slices and human epileptic foci.  Such         orbit information forms a novel method of characterizing the deterministic       properties of complex systems despite nonstationarity, and can be used to        control those systems.  Nonlinear systems also optimize their response to        weak signals in the presence of noise - stochastic resonance.  We will           define the statistical mechanics of stochastic resonance through                 simultaneous measurements of single neuron and neuronal ensemble activity.       Since neuronal ensembles may demonstrate nonlinear generalized synchrony,        we will quantify spatio-temporal generalized synchrony through dual              simultaneous single cell recordings as a function of separation in a             neuronal network.  Both unstable orbit detection and generalized synchrony       will be used to define the emergence of nonlinear behaviors in neuronal          ensembles.

"STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              This is an application for a KO2 Independent Scientist Award. The candidate is       an anesthesiologist/statistician whose research to date has focused on the           development of statistical models for the quantitative study of how neural           systems represent and transmit information the central focus of his career           research. The study of how neural systems encode information is one of the most      challenging and fascinating problems in science. The point process character of      neural spike trains means that standard signal processing techniques developed       to analyze continuous signals will have limited application in the analysis of       neural systems. The study of neural signal processing requires the development       of new quantitative techniques to accurately characterize the properties of          neural systems. These methods should be developed in close collaboration with        experimentalists to ensure that the models remain completely faithful to the         neurophysiology. For this reason, the candidate will collaborate with Professor      Matt Wilson in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT. The             research will use Professor Wilson's paradigm of simultaneous multiunit              recordings of pyramidal (place) cells in the hippocampus of freely behaving          rodents to model, how these neurons encode spatial information as the animals        perform specific behavioral tasks. The statistical methods to be developed will      be based on spatio-temporal point process models of hippocampal place cell           spiking activity and nonlinear recursive filtering algorithms based on Bayesian      statistical theory. The experimental work in this project will be carried out        in Professor Wilson's laboratory at MIT and is an integral part of his research      on characterizing the role of the hippocampus in short- and long-term memory         formation. The methodology research will be conducted in parallel at the             candidate's laboratory in the Department of Anesthesia at Massachusetts General      Hospital. The candidate will use the additional funded research time provided        by KO2 award to enhance his knowledge of hippocampus physiology and anatomy and      to develop a sound theoretical framework based on theory of point processes          from which to derive signal processing methods appropriate for neural systems.       The candidate's long-term objectives are to continue his work on neural              information processing and the study of the hippocampus in memory formation.         The research to be undertaken in this project will also provide a set of             statistical tools with which neuroscientists will be able to study information       representation and transmission in neural systems using multiunit activity data      recorded along with relevant biological signals.                                                                                                                          n/a",STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING,6392795,K02MH061637,"['NMDA receptors', ' action potentials', ' animal data', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' computational neuroscience', ' electroencephalography', ' entorhinal cortex', ' environment', ' hippocampus', ' long term memory', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' pyramidal cells', ' short term memory', ' sleep', ' space perception', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K02,2001,123541,0.007766201657398624
"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks. The proposed studies therefore         represent the ability to study information processing of the cerebellum using        quite tractable motor behaviors and then to apply that information to more           complex cognitive processes. Thus, these studies will provide a basic                understanding of information processing for important aspects of the motor           system, and could provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of the           neural basis of information processing that is applied to cognitive properties       as well.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning,6327522,R01MH057051,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral extinction', ' biological models', ' brain electronic stimulator', ' cerebellar Purkinje cell', ' cerebellar nuclei', ' cerebellum', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' electrophysiology', ' eye movements', ' laboratory rabbit', ' learning', ' microelectrodes', ' neural information processing', ' neural plasticity', ' neural transmission', ' neurons', ' operant conditionings', ' psychomotor function', ' reflex', ' statistics /biometry', ' stimulus /response', ' synapses']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2001,249250,0.003262847196721656
"DYNAMIC PATTERN ANALYSIS OF RETINAL FUNCTION   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract): The goal of the proposed work                               is to understand retinal processing through a careful analysis of the dynamic        (space-time) patterns of activity that are generated at each retinal level. The      spatiotemporal patterns will be generated in two complementary ways: (1)             patterns will be measured and constructed through a novel method of                  physiological recording of excitation and inhibition over a large region for         every cell type at each retinal level and extending the result to a population       of that cell type, and (2) the patterns will be generated as the emergent            properties of retinal models constructed by incorporating the space, time            pharmacological and morphological properties derived from single cell studies.       The measured and modeled patterns will be compared to evaluate the quantitative      hypothesis of retinal embodied in the model. The modeling infrastructure, the        Cellular Neural Network, (CNN) is now well-established massively parallel            analog array processor designed with an architecture quite similar to the            vertebrate retina. These studies will show how both simple and complex stimuli       are represented in terms of physical, electrical activity (excitatory and            inhibitory membrane currents and voltages) across arrays of thousands of             elements at each retinal level. Analyses of these data will yield insights into      the underlying neural mechanisms that mediate visual function and provide some       clues about the strategies undertaken via neuronal interactions at each retinal      level.                                                                                                                                                                    n/a",DYNAMIC PATTERN ANALYSIS OF RETINAL FUNCTION,6384257,R01EY000561,"['Urodela', ' alternatives to animals in research', ' cell type', ' disease /disorder model', ' electrophysiology', ' neural information processing', ' neural transmission', ' neuroanatomy', ' retina', ' retinal bipolar neuron', ' single cell analysis', ' visual feedback']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2001,245676,-0.010066075431048788

The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability. Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team.

This RCA will permit the PI to devote nearly full time      to research.                                                                                                                                                      Short term goals are to test the hypothesis that neuronal ensembles have         nonlinear deterministic properties.  If so, they will 1) have activity that      can be characterized and controlled through unstable periodic orbits, 2)         hen noise driven will exhibit stochastic resonance, and 3) because of            coupling will exhibit generalized (nonlinear) synchrony and emergence.           Long-term goals are to achieve a better understanding of neuronal network        and brain behavior, and to develop novel methods of treating dynamical           diseases.                                                                                                                                                         The research project will involve theoretical work on the detection of           unstable orbits in In Vitro brain slices and human epileptic foci.  Such         orbit information forms a novel method of characterizing the deterministic       properties of complex systems despite nonstationarity, and can be used to        control those systems.  Nonlinear systems also optimize their response to        weak signals in the presence of noise - stochastic resonance.  We will           define the statistical mechanics of stochastic resonance through                 simultaneous measurements of single neuron and neuronal ensemble activity.       Since neuronal ensembles may demonstrate nonlinear generalized synchrony,        we will quantify spatio-temporal generalized synchrony through dual              simultaneous single cell recordings as a function of separation in a             neuronal network.  Both unstable orbit detection and generalized synchrony       will be used to define the emergence of nonlinear behaviors in neuronal          ensembles.                                                                                                                                                        The results of this research will fundamentally alter the way that neuronal      dynamics can be characterized and controlled, will provide a means to deal       with neuronal nonstationarity, will further explain the role of noise in         the nervous system, and may provide a novel approach for the control of          pathological neuronal ensembles in dynamical diseases such as epilepsy,          spasticity, and tremor.                                                           n/a",NONLINEAR DYNAMICS OF NEURONAL ENSEMBLES,6185560,K02MH001493,"['artificial intelligence', ' brain electrical activity', ' computational neuroscience', ' electric field', ' electroencephalography', ' extracellular', ' hippocampus', ' human data', ' intracellular', ' laboratory rat', ' microelectrodes', ' neural information processing', ' neuroanatomy', ' neurons', ' neurosurgery', ' noise', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,K02,2000,99063,-0.021069161444781263
"STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              This is an application for a KO2 Independent Scientist Award. The candidate is       an anesthesiologist/statistician whose research to date has focused on the           development of statistical models for the quantitative study of how neural           systems represent and transmit information the central focus of his career           research. The study of how neural systems encode information is one of the most      challenging and fascinating problems in science. The point process character of      neural spike trains means that standard signal processing techniques developed       to analyze continuous signals will have limited application in the analysis of       neural systems. The study of neural signal processing requires the development       of new quantitative techniques to accurately characterize the properties of          neural systems. These methods should be developed in close collaboration with        experimentalists to ensure that the models remain completely faithful to the         neurophysiology. For this reason, the candidate will collaborate with Professor      Matt Wilson in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT. The             research will use Professor Wilson's paradigm of simultaneous multiunit              recordings of pyramidal (place) cells in the hippocampus of freely behaving          rodents to model, how these neurons encode spatial information as the animals        perform specific behavioral tasks. The statistical methods to be developed will      be based on spatio-temporal point process models of hippocampal place cell           spiking activity and nonlinear recursive filtering algorithms based on Bayesian      statistical theory. The experimental work in this project will be carried out        in Professor Wilson's laboratory at MIT and is an integral part of his research      on characterizing the role of the hippocampus in short- and long-term memory         formation. The methodology research will be conducted in parallel at the             candidate's laboratory in the Department of Anesthesia at Massachusetts General      Hospital. The candidate will use the additional funded research time provided        by KO2 award to enhance his knowledge of hippocampus physiology and anatomy and      to develop a sound theoretical framework based on theory of point processes          from which to derive signal processing methods appropriate for neural systems.       The candidate's long-term objectives are to continue his work on neural              information processing and the study of the hippocampus in memory formation.         The research to be undertaken in this project will also provide a set of             statistical tools with which neuroscientists will be able to study information       representation and transmission in neural systems using multiunit activity data      recorded along with relevant biological signals.                                                                                                                          n/a",STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING,6090371,K02MH061637,"['NMDA receptors', ' action potentials', ' animal data', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' computational neuroscience', ' electroencephalography', ' entorhinal cortex', ' environment', ' hippocampus', ' long term memory', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' pyramidal cells', ' short term memory', ' sleep', ' space perception', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K02,2000,123541,0.007766201657398624
"DYNAMIC PATTERN ANALYSIS OF RETINAL FUNCTION   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract): The goal of the proposed work                               is to understand retinal processing through a careful analysis of the dynamic        (space-time) patterns of activity that are generated at each retinal level. The      spatiotemporal patterns will be generated in two complementary ways: (1)             patterns will be measured and constructed through a novel method of                  physiological recording of excitation and inhibition over a large region for         every cell type at each retinal level and extending the result to a population       of that cell type, and (2) the patterns will be generated as the emergent            properties of retinal models constructed by incorporating the space, time            pharmacological and morphological properties derived from single cell studies.       The measured and modeled patterns will be compared to evaluate the quantitative      hypothesis of retinal embodied in the model. The modeling infrastructure, the        Cellular Neural Network, (CNN) is now well-established massively parallel            analog array processor designed with an architecture quite similar to the            vertebrate retina. These studies will show how both simple and complex stimuli       are represented in terms of physical, electrical activity (excitatory and            inhibitory membrane currents and voltages) across arrays of thousands of             elements at each retinal level. Analyses of these data will yield insights into      the underlying neural mechanisms that mediate visual function and provide some       clues about the strategies undertaken via neuronal interactions at each retinal      level.                                                                                                                                                                    n/a",DYNAMIC PATTERN ANALYSIS OF RETINAL FUNCTION,6178352,R01EY000561,"['Urodela', ' alternatives to animals in research', ' cell type', ' disease /disorder model', ' electrophysiology', ' neural information processing', ' neural transmission', ' neuroanatomy', ' retina', ' retinal bipolar neuron', ' single cell analysis', ' visual feedback']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2000,238521,-0.010066075431048788
"Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior Implantable devices are playing a greater role in neurologic care, but their effectiveness is limited, because they are blind to human thoughts, feelings, and behavior – factors that most dramatically affect our health. Coupling peripheral sensors to implants might help, but wouldn’t it be easier if the devices just asked us? Armed with this knowledge, next generation machines will more effectively drive neural activity in the brain to healthy states. They will also quickly learn behaviors that worsen health and guide us to better choices. Though DARPA, the NIH, and Neuralink are spending millions of dollars on new hardware for brain-computer interfaces, none focus on reciprocal, natural communication between host and machine. There is a desperate need for novel, practical methods that enable devices to learn from and guide human behavior.  In this application I propose to develop a new generation of autonomous brain-machine interfaces – devices that can question, record, act - and combine learning algorithms applied to neurosignals with teaching by their human hosts. Life with these implants will entail a subtle human- machine dialogue in which devices and humans teach and learn from each other. Humans will inform intelligent algorithms about what we are doing and feeling, while machines will incorporate this information into therapy and guide us to optimize quality of life in personalized ways. This is a paradigm shift from today’s simple devices, which are programmed by physicians during occasional office visits. I propose to demonstrate this paradigm in a practical, scalable way using current epilepsy implants that is rapidly translatable to many neurological disorders.  To achieve this goal, I will meld several cutting-edge technologies in novel ways, including: (1) State-of-the-art, high bandwidth implantables that sample neural activity, link to vast cloud- based computational power to process it, and intervene to modulate brain, spinal cord or peripheral neural activity. This work utilizes my experience from the past 20 years; (2) I will deploy powerful new computer science tools in novel ways. I will use convolutional neural nets (a.k.a. Deep Learning) to learn patterns from vast streams of continuous high-bandwidth neural data, build a two way human-machine interface using Natural Language Processing (NLP)., and probe networks with changes in human behavior and electrical stimulation and guide interventions toward therapeutic goals using Reinforcement Learning. Combining these computer science, machine learning techniques and measurements of human behavior is a new area of investigation for me that will leverage my unique background in clinical neurology and engineering to build a new class of interactive, human therapeutic devices. The goal of this project is to develop a revolutionary, new generation of implantable neurodevices that will communicate with, learn from, and teach their human hosts to better treat disease. Current implantable devices are blind to human actions, thoughts and behavior, which limits their effectiveness. State of the art computer techniques that can measure behavior and link them to brain activity will empower patients to teach, control and learn from their devices to improve health and quality of life.","Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior",10012013,DP1NS122038,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Feeling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Office Visits', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Work', 'blind', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'cloud based', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learned behavior', 'learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,DP1,2020,1134000,0.012032439202858385
"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies). Ultimately, this research aims to improve the lives and wellbeing of those suffering from spinal cord injury.

"A New Paradigm for Systems Physiology Modeling: Biomechanistic Learning Augmentation with Deep Differential Equation Representations (BLADDER) Many promising peripheral neuromodulation techniques have been proposed to treat lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction, but our lack of predictive models has forced the community (including the PI’s lab) to explore the vast parameter space of nerve targets, stimulation parameterizations, and electrode designs empirically in animal experiments by trial and error. This type of exploratory experimentation is the only current method of optimizing, personalizing, or discovering novel LUT neuromodulation techniques. Motivated by this clinical need, our long-term goal for this work is to predict the effects of neuromodulation on the LUT. To move toward this goal, we propose to develop a new modeling framework that integrates disparate biophysics models through machine learning, thereby emulating an entire organ system through a process we call Biomechanistic Learning Augmentation of Deep Differential Equation Representations (BLADDER). We will develop and use the general BLADDER framework to create an organ-level model of the normal healthy LUT throughout its filling and voiding cycles, including non-volitional neural reflex control over the bladder and urethra. Our focus on neural reflex control and organ-level scales ensures that, if successful, the BLADDER LUT model will be poised to predict effects of neuromodulation using computational studies, which so far has been impossible due to the complexity of the LUT. The BLADDER framework unites multiple individual mechanistic models (each accounting for a component function of an organ system) by using deep recurrent neural networks (RNN) to learn the appropriate coupling dynamics linking each component model. The combination of mechanistic and machine learning models under a single framework allows us to harness the advantages of both: mechanistic models excel at interpretability but suffer from a lack of scalability (becoming intractable at the level of organ systems), while machine learning models are excellent at scale but lack generalizability and insights for hypothesis generation. The BLADDER framework will scale up mechanistic models to the level of systems physiology by linking tractable model components together using a supervisory RNN, allowing the BLADDER framework to deliver both interpretability and scale. We will draw on existing SPARC datasets in the cat (e.g., Bruns and Gaunt), existing publicly available data in rat, and generate new data in the rat to construct a training dataset for the supervisory RNN. We will further draw from already published small-scale mechanistic models, validated on human and animal data, for the mechanistic components of the BLADDER LUT model. The formal process of identifying these models and datasets, and checking their validity and robustness, will clearly reveal the deficits and strengths in our theoretical and experimental understanding of the LUT in a straightforward and rational way. We will use the 10 Simple Rules to vet mechanistic models for inclusion in the BLADDER LUT model and compile a public inventory for the neurourology community. Major task 1 (Q1-2): Identify available datasets and candidate mechanistic models from published literature. Major deliverables are a public database and a whitepaper detailing the state of the field and prospects for modeling and experimental work. Major Task 2 (Q1-3): Demonstrate proof of concept of BLADDER framework. Major deliverables are a publicly available code linking two LUT component models via supervisory RNN and a report on suitable RNN architectures based on fully described dynamical systems. Major Task 3 (Q3-6): Create a multi-component BLADDER model.

"CRCNS: Deep Neural Network Approaches for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation The discovery that aberrant synchronization of rhythmic neuronal activity recorded in PD patients is suppressed by DBS has advanced the concept that measures associated with pathological activity may be used as biomarkers to control the delivery of DBS therapy. Pilot studies of aDBS in PD have reported promising clinical results from triggering DBS stimulation when the signal recorded from the DBS electrode showed a high level of oscillatory power in the beta frequency range (13 – 35 Hz). That approach, however, has important limitations. Most importantly, beta power recorded from the DBS lead is suppressed by movement including PD tremor, its detection is highly dependent on lead location and the recording montage needed to record during stimulation is incompatible with directional current steering, a recent innovation employing segmented stimulation contacts. The inherent complexity of the increased parameter space through DBS innovations also overwhelms standard programming techniques. Finally, use of additional biomarker signals (e.g., recorded from cortex) is likely to improve the ability to adaptively control DBS for disorders marked by complex multidimensional symptomatologies such as PD. The current proposal will establish methods for overcoming these limitations by developing techniques for multi-feature classification from ECoG recordings, using advanced machine learning algorithms. The proposed research builds upon the extensive and unique experiences with multi-day, extra-operative recording from DBS leads in patients at Charité Hospital and intraoperative ECoG and DBS recording from patients at the University of Pittsburgh, in order to develop computational methods to advance closed-loop, adaptive DBS (aDBS) strategies for movement disorders. This research seeks to improve computational methods for interpreting brain signals recorded from patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease.

"Closing the loop on markerless object tracking Abstract/Summary Tracking the movements of objects and parts of objects - referred to as pose estimation - is critical for understanding the mechanisms underlying complex behavior. Characterizing dynamic behaviors of animals (and other systems) is central to many disciplines, including computer science, physics, ethology, kinesiology, and sports medicine. Here we focus on neuroscience, where linking brain activity to associated dynamic behaviors is critical for both understanding normal function as well as effects of injury, disease, or degeneration. Invasive methods for measuring behavior are highly accurate, but require placement of sensors that may themselves interact with behavior and which may be susceptible to deterioration or infection. Video provides a non-invasive approach to characterizing behavior over time. Extracting behavior from video streams has, historically, been a slow and laborious process. Recent work in machine learning and artificial neural networks (ANNs), though, has revolutionized this process, making the analysis of complex video far easier and more accurate. While these systems are highly flexible, they were not designed for real time use, meaning that large video files must first be stored to disk for subsequent analysis. This poses two problems that this proposal will attempt to address. First, there is significant cost and management challenges associated with storage of large video stores, forming a practical barrier for adoption of this important technology for characterizing behavior. Second, estimates related to behavioral state are not available in real time so they cannot be used to control the experiment. We will develop a research methodology for “closing the loop”, by taking the networks trained by an existing and highly successful markerless object tracking system (DeepLabCut) and optimizing them for real time inference. After the system is functional, verified, and benchmarked, it will be shared with the community through open source repositories. Project Narrative Understanding the neural basis underlying complex behavior requires careful analysis of the dynamics of moving objects. Recent advances in computer vision has greatly facilitated our ability to track objects from video, but these tools are currently limited to offline analysis. Here we propose to build a system that addresses this problem by “closing the loop” using real time inference to be freely shared with the public to enhance ongoing research across the neuroscience spectrum.",Closing the loop on markerless object tracking,10047656,R03MH123990,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Behavior', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethology', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Freezing', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Kinesiology', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Movement', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sports Medicine', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gaze', 'haptics', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'sensor', 'time use', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,162500,-0.0017429597268318199
"A Comparative Framework for Modeling the Low-Dimensional Geometry of Neural Population States Project Summary Advances in neural recording technology now provide access to neural activity at high temporal resolutions, from many brain areas, and during complex and naturalistic behavior. Interpreting these types of high-dimensional and unconstrained neural recordings is still a major challenge in neuroscience. The aim of this project is to develop innovative methods for distilling high-dimensional neural activity patterns into simpler low-dimensional formats that can be effectively compared across time, conditions, or even across species. Our team is uniquely positioned to not only develop these novel methods, but also apply them to characterize changes in neural systems across a wide range of clinically-relevant perturbations, including addiction, sensory manipulation, and disease. In this project, theory, methods, and models will be developed for: 1) learning low-dimensional latent space models that align many neural datasets onto a common reference frame for comparison, 2) comparing datasets and testing the impact of a variety of perturbations (e.g. monocular deprivation, addiction and withdrawal) on the shape or geometry of neural activity from its baseline state, and 3) investigating the role of specific cell types and microcircuits on shaping population activity over time, during sleep, and in response to certain classes of perturbations. This project will provide new tools and frameworks for comparing neural datasets, leading to robust measures of disease, signatures of addiction, and other network-level reflections of environment and behavior. Significance: As neural datasets continue to grow in size, new methods for analysis are becoming of utmost importance in driving scientific understanding of the brain. The methods developed in this proposal will identify new ways to learn network-level signatures that allow us to link and compare different neural activity patterns. A robust ability to compare activity across time and animals will have wide reaching impacts, and provide new tools to advance network-level understanding of disease. Innovation: This project will leverage state-of-the-art approaches in high-dimensional statistics and geometry, which are simultaneously advancing in the context of deep learning (DL) architectures, and to tackle challenges in neural coding. This project represents a truly innovative combination of tools in machine learning and computational neuroscience which will likely transfer knowledge in both directions: from machine learning to neuroscience and back. The unique application of advanced mathematical tools in geometry and optimization to population-level analysis of perturbations will be transformative, not only for neuroscience but also in the study of DL architectures. Project Narrative Interpreting patterns of activity across large networks of neurons is an incredibly challenging problem that remains a key objective of the BRAIN initiative. This project will develop transformative methods for distilling neural activity patterns into compact, informative representations that facilitate comparison across datasets from different brain areas and multiple time-scales, and at different states of neurological disease.",A Comparative Framework for Modeling the Low-Dimensional Geometry of Neural Population States,10007243,R01EB029852,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'density', 'deprivation', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'monocular deprivation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,1000000,0.004231063754352937
"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles. This effort will contribute to the restoration of voluntary limb movements in individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke.",Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation,9878937,R01NS102259,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Digit structure', 'Elbow', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Error Sources', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Forearm', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Intramuscular', 'Joints', 'Lifting', 'Limb structure', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle Fatigue', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Space', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Quadriplegia', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'artificial neural network', 'awake', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experience', 'finger movement', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'grasp', 'hand grasp', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor behavior', 'neuroprosthesis', 'nonhuman primate', 'response', 'restoration', 'robotic device', 'scapula']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2020,301922,0.0052902412815769686
"Crossing space and time: uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of multimodal and multiscale brain activity The brain is a complex dynamical system, with a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales ranging from microns and milliseconds to centimeters and years. Activity at any given scale contributes to activity at the scales above it and can influence activity at smaller scales. Thus a true understanding of the brain requires the ability to understand how each level contributes to the system as a whole. Most brain research focuses on a single scale (single unit firing, activity in a circuit), which cannot account for the constraints imposed by activities at other scales. The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework for the integration of multiscalar, multimodal measurements of brain activity. One of the challenges in understanding how activity translates across scales is that features that are relevant at one scale (e.g., firing rate) do not have clear analogues at other scales. We address this issue by defining trajectories in “state space” at each scale, where the state space is defined by parameters and time scales appropriate to each type of data. The trajectory of brain activity through state space can uncover features like attractor dynamics and limit cycles that characterize the evolution of activity. Using machine learning along with new and existing multimodal measurements of brain activity (MRI, optical, and electrophysiological), we propose to establish methods that relate trajectories across scales while handling the mismatch in temporal sampling rates inherent in multi-scale data. Specific aims are 1. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at fast scales influence activity at slower scales. Different modalities have different inherent temporal resolutions in addition to different types of contrast. Current methods generally downsample the faster modality in some way, losing much information in the process. We will leverage variants on long short-term memory (LSTM) network architectures to learn the relationship between state space trajectories acquired simultaneously with population recording and optical imaging, and with optical imaging and fMRI. 2. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at slow scales influence activity at faster scales. Leveraging the same LSTM-based approach, we will learn how slower, larger scale activity affects activity at smaller scales, using whisker stimulation as a test case. We anticipate inclusion of the large scale activity (measured with fMRI or optical imaging) will improve prediction of the response at smaller scales (measured with optical imaging or population recording). Our work will allow us to begin to answer a wide range of questions about how the brain functions (e.g., what type of localized stimulation that will drive the brain to a desired global state? How does modulation of the global brain state affect local information processing?) and provide guidance for future experiments by identifying key features that influence activity across scales. By approaching the whole brain as a complex dynamical system, we will break free from the limitations of previous studies that focus on individual cells or circuits. We also expect our work to stimulate new theories that incorporate multiple scales of activity. The brain is a complex, dynamical system that exhibits structured activity at many different space and time scales. Most existing studies focus on a single scale (for example, spiking of individual neurons or activity in a particular circuit). However, interactions occur across scales and may account for much of the variability observed in the brain. This proposal will develop a framework for integrating data from different scales using machine learning tools. The results will improve our understanding of how the brain functions and serve as a foundation for modeling neuromodulatory treatments for brain disorders.",Crossing space and time: uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of multimodal and multiscale brain activity,10007011,R01EB029857,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'brain research', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'long short term memory', 'long short term memory network', 'millisecond', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiscale data', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'optical imaging', 'predicting response', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1124452,-0.003321005347588915
"Population Invariant Neural Decoding Neural interfaces hold great potential to restore movement and communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. These systems rely on neural decoding algorithms to translate recorded neural activity into, for example, movements of a prosthetic limb or intended speech sounds. However, many technical challenges limit the predictive accuracy of these decoding models, preventing widespread deployment of restorative neuroprosthetic devices. A key challenge is the limited data available to train decoding models. In existing approaches, models must be trained separately for each individual subject, usually during simple behavioral tasks, and consequently fail to generalize well to new subjects or complex naturalistic behavioral settings. This proposal leverages recent advances in machine learning that directly address these limitations by developing a new decoding model framework that is capable of combining neural data across many subjects and tasks, as well as incorporating large-scale simulated data to improve prediction accuracy. In this framework, a single global model learns an internal representation of the neural system that is invariant to variations in behavioral task and stimulus set, anatomical variations, and functional variations in neural tuning of the underlying neuronal population (i.e., population-invariant neural decoding). This global model can therefore be applied and calibrated to new subjects and behavioral tasks where little or no additional training data is available. Using an existing intracranial neural data set collected from a large number of different subjects and stimulus sets, the project will establish this new modeling approach based on deep learning architectures that are explicitly designed to incorporate data pooled across subjects and tasks. We propose to show, through validation on measured intracranial neural data, that a global neuronal population-invariant decoding model substantially improves model prediction accuracy and generalization relative to existing state-of-the-art neural decoding models across many subjects. Development and validation of this approach will open new avenues for researchers to combine disparate data sets, for example, enabling community development, improvement, and sharing of “open source” models that can be shared among research groups and effectively applied across research studies. Thus, the proposal seeks to address key limitations in present neural decoding model approaches which must ultimately convert measured neural activity into useful behavioral or communication parameters across a wide range of subjects and complex behaviors in order for translational effects to be realized in important clinical applications of neural interfaces. Neural interfaces rely on predictive models to restore lost motor or communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. This project leverages novel machine learning models that allow neural data to be pooled across large-scale multi-subject data sets, permitting an order of magnitude increase in model complexity and prediction accuracy that is immediately generalizable across large patient populations with disordered speech or motor function. The outcome of this project is a new modeling framework where a single, highly performant global model can be easily calibrated to individual patient cases with limited data while maintaining high prediction accuracy.",Population Invariant Neural Decoding,9874435,R21DC018374,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Experimental Designs', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Sound', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'TensorFlow', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'large datasets', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'premonitory sensory phenomena', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R21,2020,235500,-0.0058880875858910425
"Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces Project Abstract. Candidate and career goals: I am an engineer by training, with a strong background in neural engineering and the development of motor brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). My career goal is to establish an independent nonhuman primate (NHP) laboratory with two primary aims. First, I will advance our fundamental understanding of the motor system via the combination of electrophysiology with novel statistical and computational methods. Second, I will leverage this knowledge to develop frameworks for superior BMI systems.  Throughout my academic and research career I have developed expertise in engineering, computation, and neuroscience with the goal of pursuing these aims. Advances in machine learning, large-scale neural recordings, and deep learning in neural networks are happening quickly (in part via the BRAIN Initiative), and are very promising for the field. Yet very few researchers have the correct combination of skills to make use of them in my areas of interest. In completing the proposed training, I will be uniquely positioned to perform the innovative work necessary to advance our understanding of the planning and execution of cortically controlled movements. I will train the next generation of scientists and engineers in the experimental and computational methods necessary to understand fundamental principles of cortical computations.  Research plan: In this project, I will employ multiple computational approaches to understand the structure of population activity in motor cortex (M1) across multiple kinds of behaviors. I will then use that knowledge to create high performance BMI decoders that will be applicable to a wide range of movements.  Recent empirical observations are changing our view of the structure of M1 activity. During one particular task (e.g., reaching), neural activity may seem to exist within a small space that it explores completely. Yet as more tasks are observed, it becomes clear that activity comprises a highly structured geometry within a much larger space. This means that activity patters for different movements do not come ‘near’ one another or overlap. While counterintuitive, this geometry yields new opportunities. By exploiting the separation of activity patterns, movements can be readily distinguished, even when unfolding simultaneously. I will further explore this geometry across multiple behaviors, both in primates and neural network models, to develop new BMI methods. The specific aims of the plan are to (1) create a high-performance decoder for a novel wheelchair-relevant navigation task, (2) build network models to understand M1 activity structure and identify decoding principles that will generalize across tasks (reaching, navigation), and (3) implement a multitask BMI using a unified decoder that allows animals to both navigate and interact with objects. Career development plan: I will be trained by Dr. Mark Churchland and Dr. Larry Abbott at Columbia University. Project Narrative Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) interpret brain activity to control external devices (computers, prosthetic limbs), and can restore voluntary movement to individuals with limb loss or paralysis. BMIs for reaching and grasping have been demonstrated in human clinical trials, and must now be extended to perform a variety of movements. The proposed work will use advanced computational methods to create an intuitively controllable and high performance BMI system applicable to many natural movements, including locomotion. This work will both develop neurotechnology, and add to our scientific understanding of the computational principles that underlie activity in motor cortex.",Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces,9952827,K99NS115919,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Animals', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biomimetics', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'career development', 'combat', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'mind control', 'multitask', 'network models', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotechnology', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual world']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2020,136242,0.002130100175315991
"Next generation brain-machine interfaces controlled synergistically with artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY Over 5 million people in the USA – nearly 1 person in 50 – live with a form of paralysis due to causes including stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and ALS. People who have lost the ability to move also lose a profound sense of control, freedom, and independence in their lives. But paralysis does not take away one's intent or desire to move; the brain still encodes these thoughts through neural signals. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to restore the ability to communicate with the world by translating these neural signals into actions. BMIs decode neural signals into the movements of a computer cursor on a screen or a robotic arm, allowing the user to interact with the world autonomously. While BMIs have existed for over two decades, they have remained in pilot clinical trials dating back to 2004 and have not achieved widespread use. The key reason for this is that BMI performance has not achieved levels of performance that overcome their costs and risks. This is true for both invasive BMIs requiring neurosurgery, as well as for non-invasive BMIs, which can be used without surgical procedures but achieve low performance. This proposal aims to dramatically increase the quality of life for millions with paralysis by making widely accessi- ble BMIs available within the next ﬁve years. To achieve this groundbreaking goal, there needs to be a paradigm shift in the way BMIs fundamentally operate. Revolutionary next generation BMIs making signiﬁcant impact must be designed to: (1) achieve categorically unprecedented performance not possible with current BMI systems (e.g., over an order of magnitude improvement) and (2) minimize cost to patients, ideally being non-invasive. En- tirely novel BMI architectures are needed to fundamentally transcend a performance vs cost trade-off, achieving excellent performance at lower risks and costs. To meet this need, I propose to develop a next-generation BMI where the user and an artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) agent synergistically cooperate. We term this an “AI-BMI.” The AI agent predicts the user's intended motor actions and synergistically helps to complete them. Critically, the AI agent aids the precise and detailed execution of the user's intended movements, augmenting performance. By doing so, this architecture fundamentally changes the design objectives of BMIs from neural decoding of precise movements (difﬁcult) to behavioral and neural inference of the user's intent (easier). Non-invasive AI-BMIs, if successful, would be transformative, enabling next generation BMI technology that allows people with paralysis to once again move, but mitigates medical risks associated with neurosurgery and lowers system costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE For people who have lost the ability to move due to movement disorders, including paralysis and ALS, brain- mahince interfaces (BMIs) aim to restore movement and communication by decoding neural activity from motor regions of the brain to control prosthetic devices. The proposed work aims to create and optimize a new class of transformative BMIs that incorporate an external artiﬁcial intelligence agent who infers the user's intent and helps to carry out prosthesis actions. If successful, these new BMIs would signiﬁcantly increase BMI performance while lowering risks and costs, enabling widespread use.",Next generation brain-machine interfaces controlled synergistically with artificial intelligence,10003004,DP2NS122037,"['Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Medical', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Prosthesis', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Transcend', 'Translating', 'Work', 'arm', 'brain machine interface', 'cost', 'design', 'intelligent agent', 'neurosurgery', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,DP2,2020,2340000,0.006217080482105604
"Markerless Tracking of 3D Posture to Reveal the Sensory Origins of Body Schema The goal of this proposed research is to reveal the sensory origins underlying the body schema representation. Body schema is the brain's internal model of the body's spatial configuration. This internal representation is critical for sensorimotor processing, movement control, and self-awareness, and is continuously updated during movement. Body schema representations are disrupted when somatosensory input is lost. The first step toward discover the neural correlates of body schema is to uncover neural mechanisms that generate body posture representation. We hypothesize that sensory inputs from primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are transformed to construct a body posture representation.  To delineate the mechanisms underlying the neural coding of body posture, this project will utilize large- scale monitoring, apply interventional tools, develop new data analysis tools, and integrate new approaches. Our approach is to perform large-scale electrophysiological recording and novel markerless tracking of 3D posture in freely moving mice. To track posture, the first aim is to adapt a markerless tracking pipeline comprised of a deep 3D convolutional neural network to process high-speed videography of mouse behavior from multiple cameras. The second aim is to perform large-scale recording of neurons in S1, S2, and PPC and use advanced computational approaches to determine which postural features best explain the activity of neurons in these cortical areas. Finally, the third aim is to use optogenetic and projection-specific manipulations to address the causal impact of proprioceptive inputs from S1 and S2 on coding of posture in PPC. This research promises to uncover how sensory inputs are involved in generating the body schema representation and guiding behavior.  Extensive training will be required to carry out this project and achieve my goal of earning a tenure-track professor position. The rigorous methodological and intellectual environment in Dr. Fan Wang’s lab and the Duke Neurobiology community will advance my conceptual knowledge and technical skills. I will implement deep learning techniques through training and collaboration with specialists. I will learn new techniques by attending Neuropixel and computational neuroscience courses. Finally, I will develop my professional skills by frequent attendance of seminars, workshops, and meeting with a postdoctoral mentorship committee.  The proposed project will be conducted in the Department of Neurobiology at the Duke University Medical Campus. This interdisciplinary community at Duke will bolster the research and training included in this application through frequent interaction with talented and collaborative faculty, organization of seminars and symposia, numerous opportunities to practice research talks and receive valuable feedback, formation of a personalized postdoctoral mentorship committee, extensive career and professional training, and invaluable support from the postdoctoral association. Project Narrative Body schema, the brain’s internal model of the spatial configuration of its body parts, is normally updated during movement, but can be disrupted following amputation, stroke, or deafferentation. Understanding how neural circuits generate body schema representation in health and disease could pave the way for improvements in surgical practice, stroke recovery therapy, brain-machine interface technology, and prosthetic limb engineering. Furthermore, sustaining an internal model of the body is a key element of awareness of one’s own body and the body of others, so findings on the sensory origins underlying body schema will have implications ranging from sensorimotor processing, motor control, interpersonal representations, and social cognition.",Markerless Tracking of 3D Posture to Reveal the Sensory Origins of Body Schema,9987939,F32MH122995,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amputation', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data Analyses', 'Deafferentation procedure', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Experimental Models', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Self Perception', 'Sensory', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Talents', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'meetings', 'motor control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'professor', 'relating to nervous system', 'research to practice', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'social cognition', 'somatosensory', 'stroke recovery', 'symposium', 'tenure track', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,37289,-0.004784668360371777
"Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understanding how stored memories change as a function of experience. The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weaker—it can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia.

"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program will establish new framework for understanding the cognitive neuroscience architecture of scene perception, with the aim of unraveling how the human brain analyzes the geometry and functionality of visual environment in order to guide our actions and navigation in the world.",Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene,9910403,R01EY026042,"['3-Dimensional', '4 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Floor', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visuospatial', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'support vector machine', 'vector']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,306185,0.005615480834963632
"CRCNS: Neural computations for continuous control in virtual reality foraging Neuroscience has been able to gain major insights by relating measurements of neural activity to the  brain’s sensory inputs and motor outputs. Yet most neural activity supports computations and cognitive functions (‘thoughts’) that are not directly measurable by the experimenter. The investigators for the  present proposal invented a novel method to model an animal's thoughts by combining eXplainable  Artificial Intelligence (XAI) cognitive models for naturalistic tasks with measurements of the animal’s  sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. This model, called Inverse Rational Control (IRC), infers the internal model assumptions under which an animal's actions would be optimal. It then provides estimates of time series of subjective beliefs about the world that are consistent with this internal model. These estimates provide targets for a dimensionality reduction framework that assesses task-relevant  computational dynamics within neural population activity. The investigators propose to use these analysis  tools to find neural representations and transformations that implement these cognitive processes. They will apply this to a complex, naturalistic task that they developed: catching fireflies in virtual reality. The  monkeys they successfully trained to perform this task demonstrably weigh uncertainty, develop  predictions and long-term strategies, and apply nonlinear dynamics — all computations that are  fundamental for brain function. The investigators propose first to apply their method to analyze existing behavioral data and neural recordings collected in a simple version of this task with a single target firefly.  They will then collect new data on a multi-firefly version of the task, which incentivizes animals to make and implement longer-term plans. To analyze this data, the investigators will generalize their approach to  allow them to learn which compressed representations are selected by the animal as the foundation for  their strategies. These results will be used to form predictions about neural computations that will be tested using the electrophysiological data collected from multiple brain regions during this project. The  results of this study will explain the computations required to perform a complex, strategic navigation task  in the presence of uncertainty, and will demonstrate a new paradigm for understanding naturalistic brain computations. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project will uncover the neural basis of cognitive processes in the primate brain that underlie spatial  navigation, strategic planning, and behavioral control. It will demonstrate how a powerful new paradigm  for understanding complex, natural brain computations can apply to a wide variety of tasks, to explain  either adaptive or pathologically structured behavior. This will provide crucial guidance for understanding  and improving disrupted human cognitive function. n/a",CRCNS: Neural computations for continuous control in virtual reality foraging,10146521,R01NS120407,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Fireflies', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Instruction', 'Juice', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathologic', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Utah', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'way finding']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,423814,0.0021828851931446945
"Investigating the neurophysiological underpinnings of higher-order statistical learning in humans PROJECT SUMMARY A diverse range of behaviors including language, event segmentation, and learning to play an instrument involve parsing complex temporal sequences. Item co-occurrence in a sequence can exist between pairs of items shown consecutively, as well as triplets, quadruplets and other higher order sets. For example, when learning a language both humans and natural language processing algorithms make use of first order statistics about which words tend to follow others, and higher-order statistics about the grammar of sentences and paragraphs. The statistics of this co-occurrence between sets of different sizes can influence how well people learn the sequence. We can demonstrate this learning by presenting stimuli in a sequence determined by a walk on a highly clustered graph where stimuli within a large cluster tend to co-occur more frequently than stimuli in different clusters. When subjects are shown motor cues generated from a walk on such a graph, they exhibit shorter reaction times and more similar BOLD activity for successive cues drawn from the same cluster than when they are drawn from different clusters. Generalizable theories of hippocampal function suggest that its role in learning and predicting abstract relationships could subserve this behavior. In line with this theory, neuroimaging data implicates the hippocampus and downstream cortical regions in this behavior. However, direct electrophysiological measures of neural activity during the performance of this task have not been examined, leaving the description of the neural underpinnings of the behavior incomplete. We propose to use electrocorticography (ECoG) to test the hypothesis that activity in the hippocampus reflects behavioral change across clusters, and is sensitive to higher-order associations between stimuli. Our investigation is an important next step in testing theories of how the hippocampus aids relational learning, and it will add to knowledge of how information in the world is represented in the brain and how it aids or hinders learning. PROJECT NARATIVE Identifying complex relationships between items in a sequence is a crucial component of learning in humans, and is thought to rely on activity in the hippocampus. However, the neural substrates that allow humans to learn higher-order statistics among stimuli in a sequence have not been fully explored, greatly limiting our understanding of sequential information encoding in the brain. We propose to use electrocorticography (ECoG) to test the hypothesis that hippocampal activity reflects these complex relationships between items, and tracks behavioral changes that demonstrate learning.",Investigating the neurophysiological underpinnings of higher-order statistical learning in humans,9991400,F31MH120925,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Distant', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Quadruplet Multiple Birth', 'Reaction Time', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Walking', 'discounting', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sequence learning', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'theories', 'way finding']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,-0.005452066060569895
"An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms An intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) is used to record electrical signals directly from a person's brain, predict their intention from those signals, then control an assistive device (e.g., a computer cursor, prosthetic limb, or powered wheelchair) according to those intentions. This technology enables severely paralyzed people to interact with the world. However, designing robust algorithms to extract intent from recordings of single neurons is extremely challenging, in large part because of the very limited access to humans, or even monkeys, from whom these invasive recordings can be made. In this project, we will develop a model iBCI system that generates real-time biomimetic neural data by capturing the high-degree-of-freedom finger movements of able-bodied human subjects. To accomplish this, we will construct a modular recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN will be trained to predict the motor cortex activity of a monkey from the monkey's own finger kinematics. Small modules of the RNN will be interchanged according the particular animal or recording session to model the high inter-session variability present in motor cortex. Once the modular RNN is trained, its weights will be fixed and human finger kinematics will be used as the RNN inputs, which will generate subject-controlled emulated neural activity. The emulated neural activity can be passed to iBCI decoding algorithms that control computer cursors or other physical devices, allowing human subjects to interact directly with decoders in real time, closed-loop conditions. We call this model system the jaBCI. The jaBCI is low cost and noninvasive, making it possible to rapidly test and design novel iBCI decoders using statistically rigorous sample sizes. The project will be executed in close collaboration with intracortical microelectrode array data expert Dr. Lee Miller at Northwestern University. Dr. Miller's lab, with the help of our consultant Dr. Mathis, will obtain simultaneous finger kinematics and neural activity of monkey subjects that will serve as the training data for the RNN component of the iBCI model. We will validate the emulated neural data generated by the jaBCI across many measures to ensure the model captures as many features of intracortical data as possible. These include comparing the model and actual iBCI in subject performance, learning rates, control strategies, neural variation across days, neural firing rate distributions, and low-dimensional neural dynamics. With the validated model, we will undertake a study to rigorously evaluate the highest performing, current state-of-the-art iBCI decoders. This will yield useful insight into the features of decoders that yield the greatest performance gains, overcoming the current impossibility to compare iBCI decoders in well-controlled studies using more than two or three naïve human subjects. We will also use the iBCI model to evaluate novel decoder designs, and to determine the features of neural dynamics that are consistent across common iBCI tasks to help focus decoder development on those features. Narrative Brain-computer interfaces are systems that translate the electrical neural signatures of thought into instructions for a personal computer or powered wheelchair, which is an incredibly useful technology to help paralyzed people regain some independence and ability to communicate. This work would develop a tool that scientists can use to design, test, and optimize the sophisticated computer programs that translate brain signals into device instructions without having to implant electrodes into a person's brain until the program is completed and rigorously tested.

"Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication. Rett Syndrome (RTT) is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by partial or complete loss of acquired spoken language, acquired motor skills and stereotypic hand movements. Mutations in X-linked gene methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), a chromatin remodeler and gene regulator, is the causative gene for typical RTT. RTT is hypothesized to be the result of altered synaptic connectivity and plasticity caused by abnormal experience-dependent synapse development and maintenance. However, few experimental paradigms have explored how synaptic plasticity in RTT is affected over time and physiological changes with cellular, circuit and behavioral level granularity. Using Mecp2-null and heterozygous mouse models, we have previously shown that MECP2 regulates the timing of experience-dependent plasticity in the adult auditory cortex in a learned maternal behavior paradigm. We found that Mecp2-heterozygous females (SurHet) were inefficient gatherers, likely due to atypical auditory perception, caused by an abnormal, transient increase in numbers of mature perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are extracellular matrix structures that act as physical barriers for plasticity, and form predominantly around cortical parvalbumin GABAergic neurons. Major questions remain: Pup retrieval behavior is a complex sequence of events involving auditory, tactile, olfactory senses and goal-directed motor events. How do different sensory inputs (pup vocalizations, feel and smell of pups) contribute to the motor outputs (adult vocalizations, goal-directed search and carrying pups by mouth to the nest)? Our aims in this R15 proposal are to (1) characterize vocalizations/syllables and interactions between pups and adult females during pup gathering task, using integrated analysis of audio and video recordings with new machine learning algorithms; (2) identify the time line of altered PNN expression in piriform cortex, a brain region thought to be important for olfactory coding and a relay station for multisensory integration using immunostaining/imaging and then, surgical manipulations of piriform cortex. We hypothesize that expression of mature PNNs in the piriform cortex is regulated by MECP2 and contribute to proper integration and functioning of distinct components of pup retrieval behavior. The results from this study aims to identify novel circuits and mechanisms involved in multisensory integration of vocal communication during complex social behavior, which are one of the most striking yet underexplored phenotypes in RTT. Relevance to health: Rett Syndrome is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder with sensory, motor and social impairments; however, it is currently unknown where and how these impairments develop and change over time in adulthood. This proposal aims to understand how plasticity, the ability of the brain to incorporate and adapt to changes in its environment and surroundings, is affected by mutated genes in RTT and associated neurological disorders. Rett syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). The overall goal is to determine how MECP2 deficiency results in altered experience-dependent plasticity, critical for learning and navigating one's social environment, and to observed stereotypic RTT phenotypes.",Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication.,10045956,R15MH124042,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Tactile', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Ultrasonics', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'deep learning algorithm', 'differential expression', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'girls', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'middle age', 'motor control', 'mouse model', 'multisensory', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'piriform cortex', 'programs', 'pup', 'sensory input', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social communication', 'stereotypy', 'undergraduate student', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R15,2020,450753,-0.027616340704406588
"Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation Project Summary This project’s long-term goal is a fuller understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of olfactory sensory adaptation that facilitate odor discrimination in the natural world. To confront the wide fluctuations in intensity and temporal variability that are characteristic of natural odor environments, animals have evolved refined neurosensory mechanisms for parsing behaviorally-relevant signals such as pheromones from background nuisance odors. This project seeks to elucidate how adaptive mechanisms in the olfactory periphery play a central role in this discrimination task. The project will utilize a novel behavioral assay that permits precise quantification of the logic used by insects in navigating complex, temporally dynamic odor environments. By combining this assay with data analytic methods and machine learning, a comprehensive lexicon of archetypal navigational strategies of insect odor navigation will be derived. Importantly, since both odors and insects can be simultaneously tracked in this assay, the project will uncover strategies employed by insects in not just static, but also fluctuating odor landscapes. By quantifying how these strategies modulate in time, the role of memory in shaping navigational strategies will also be determined. The project will then leverage this dictionary of navigational logic to quantify how various mechanisms of adaptation in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons can shape odor discrimination. Importantly, this project will examine the role of olfactory sensory adaptation in an ethologically-relevant way, by connecting mechanisms that operate at the level of sensory input with neural computations that affect output behavior. Further, since the behavioral assay tracks complex odor environments simultaneous with freely-moving insects, the impact of behavior on future signal acquisition – behavioral feedback onto odor stimuli – is fully maintained. The behavioral experiments and data analysis in this project utilize the tractable, highly-characterized system of Drosophila melanogaster, in which a wealth of existing genetic tools will allow directed experimentation of specific adaptive mechanisms in olfaction. The results of this project will elucidate how insects effectively navigate complex odor environments, and how olfactory systems maintain sensitivity despite odor conflicts and temporal variability. Project Narrative This project will contribute to our understanding of how the olfactory sensory periphery and neural circuitry have evolved to effectively encode our vast and varied chemical environment. The project will help reveal how odor discrimination capability is maintained in natural odor landscapes, leading to practical interventional strategies for the control of disease vectors such as tsetse flies and mosquitos, who rely critically on their sense of smell to navigate. Chemical sensing is the only shared sensation among organisms as simple as bacteria and as complex as humans, and this project will enhance our fundamental knowledge of this universal sensory modality.",Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation,9868821,F32MH118700,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Culicidae', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Dictionary', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Vectors', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Insecta', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Left', 'Logic', 'Lymph', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Olfactory Receptor Neurons', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pheromone', 'Photosensitivity', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tsetse Flies', 'Walking', 'analytical method', 'disorder control', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'light intensity', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurosensory', 'novel', 'odorant-binding protein', 'optogenetics', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,69554,-0.01437951273794744
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9882986,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2020,16736,0.0018795949009934832
"A new mechanistic and technological framework for uncovering the spinal cord neural systems important for functional recovery after injury Project Summary and Abstract Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) are improving, but little is known about the neural systems that would be most effective to target such interventions. Sensory based rehabilitation suggests a strong link between cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory neuron activity and motor recovery. Previous experiments provide strong support for the intermediate zone (IZ) of the spinal cord (SC) as an important site mediating this recovery. However, few studies have assessed the role of specific IZ neurons in functional recovery. Key barriers to progress include lack of characterization of specific cell types within the IZ and a paucity of tools to visualize circuits and test their functions in motor performance and recovery following SCI. Our lab combines sophisticated mouse genetic approaches with sensitive motor movement tracking to understand how sensory information is encoded by the SC to influence behavior. Using this approach, we uncovered that intermediate zone (IZ) parvalbumin positive interneurons (PVs) are important for tactile motor responses and locomotion. We hypothesize that IZ-PVs process sensory information to activate specific muscle groups during locomotion and that they play a critical role in activity-based functional recovery following SCI. The ability to identify circuits important for functional recovery relies on how accurately we can quantify differences in behavioral outcomes. We are implementing an unsupervised approach using 3-D pose dynamics and artificial intelligence (AI) to characterize both sensitive behavioral biomarkers and uncover key spinal cord circuits important for the recovery process. Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration are improving, and this project both identifies the neural systems and synaptic mechanisms that would be most effective to target such interventions and establishes an AI-based platform for fast, reliable and unbiased quantification of motor recovery in rodents. Thus, this project makes original and important contributions to the field of spinal cord research in ways that are specifically aligned with central missions of the NINDS. Moreover, our experimental scrutiny at both the neural and behavioral levels establishes a critical foundation for developing a leading research program and securing independent award funding studying the spinal cord circuits important for sensorimotor function and recovery following SCI. To this end, I have developed a thorough and pragmatic career development plan supported by a strong committee of mentors with extensive track records of laboratory and departmental level mentoring and distinguished portfolios of SCI-specific grant support from the NIH, DoD and private foundations. My career development activities will be focused on four aspects of my academic success. 1) Mentorship and guidance focused on laboratory management. 2) Development and growth of my independent research program and award funding, with a focus on SCI research gap-based training. 3) Navigating institutional responsibilities and fulfilling requirements for promotion and tenure. 4) Expanding my scientific network and profile.

"Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Selective attention is an essential cognitive ability that permits us to effectively process and act upon relevant information while ignoring distracting events. A network involving frontal and parietal cortex for top-down attentional control, referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), is active during both spatial and non- spatial (feature-based) attention. However, we know very little about the fine structure of attentional control activity in the DAN, how this structure changes to represent different to-be-attended stimulus features, how the connectivity within the DAN, and between the DAN and sensory cortex shifts when attending different features, or how these top-down processes and their influence in sensory cortex unfold over time. This gap in our knowledge is a critical problem for our models and theories of attention, and because attentional deficits are involved in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia. The working model guiding this research is that top-down attentional control, based on different to-be-attended stimulus attributes, is guided by a smaller-scale neural fine structure within the DAN and prefrontal cortex that makes specific connections with specialized areas of visual cortex coding the attended attributes. Moreover, the time course of activity within the DAN in relation to that in sensory cortex follows a top-down cascading model, being earliest in frontal, then parietal cortex, and finally sensory cortex for preparatory, voluntary, attentional control. To identify the functional networks for attentional control for different forms of attention, and to define their time courses, this project uses innovative simultaneous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Advanced signal processing and modeling, including multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), graph theoretic connectivity analysis, and Granger causality analysis will be used to reveal the fine functional anatomy and time course of attentional control and selection. The project includes three experiments that vary the to-be-attended stimulus attributes from spatial location to stimulus features (color and motion), and pursues three aims. Aim 1 is to reveal the fine structure of top-down preparatory attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus features. Aim 2 is to elucidate the specific connectivity between fine structures for preparatory attentional control in the DAN and their target sensory structures in sensory cortex. Aim 3 is to reveal the time course of top-down attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus attributes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The capacity to focus attention is at the core of human mental functioning, and therefore, elucidating the neural bases of attention remains a central challenge for neuroscience, representing an essential aim in translational efforts to ameliorate attentional deficits in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia.",Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning,9878145,R01MH117991,"['Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Color', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Discrimination', 'Dorsal', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'data integration', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mental function', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective attention', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,530307,-0.005552754111156748
"CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits Despite substantial progress characterizing neural responses, it is particularly challenging to determine  causal interactions within recurrently connected circuits due to the confounding influence of the  interconnections. This proposed project pioneers a nascent field of closed-loop computational neuroscience that enables real-time feedback stimulation during experiments to decouple recurrently connected elements and make stronger causal inferences about their interactions. Specifically, the  contributions of this project will include: Aim 1) Using modern unsupervised machine learning methods to fit latent state dynamical system models of population responses under closed-loop stimulation. The  developed techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in genetically targeted inhibitory interneurons  across S 1 cortical laminae in the mouse to map the causal effect of inhibitory cells on the sensory gain in  excitatory cells. Aim 2) Merging and extending tools from network feedback control and causal inference  to identify functional connections between network nodes using realistic experimental constraints. These  techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in different S1 laminae of the mouse, using distributed  perturbations to identify the functional connectivity between microcircuit layers during sensory stimulation.  Aim 3) Developing a large-scale computational modeling environment to serve as an in si\ico testbed for the community.  Significance: The proposed project changes the de facto standard use of stimulation in experiments to  leverage the full power of new recording and s.timulation technology for decoupling recurrently connected  variables and making stronger causal inferences.  Broader impacts: While the project uses rodent somatosensation as a model system, the results of this  project will provide new techniques to study neurologic disorders involving disfunction of recurrent circuits  (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and depression). The open-source implementations will constitute  critical algorithmic infrastructure for closed-loop stimulation experiments. This project will also result in the  production of new trainees in an emerging new interdisciplinary field of closed-loop computational neuroscience. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The neural circuits that fail in many neurologic disorders (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and  depression) are difficult to study because they involve complex feedback loops. This project will develop  algorithms that combine measurements and stimulation in real-time to provide powerful new tools to  uncover the operating principles of these circuits and change their operation. Discovery in this area can  help improve understanding of neurologic disorders and development of new stimulation therapies. n/a",CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits,9978162,R01NS115327,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Closure by clamp', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Opsin', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Production', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventroposterior Medial Nucleus of the Thalamus', 'Vibrissae', 'awake', 'cell type', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'open source', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'real time model', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'technology development', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,324660,-0.03429394220944359
"Neurophysiologically-informed Design of Flexible, 2-learner Brain-Machine Interfaces for Robust and Skillful Performance PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to elucidate the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing. The outcome of the proposed work has the potential to guide the development of the next generation of neurophysiologically-informed, cortically-controlled neuroprosthetic systems for patients with neurological disorders. State-of-the-art brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage machine learning to rapidly calibrate to the neural activity of individuals, but performance also benefits from subjects learning to reliably produce desired neural activity patterns. The basic science and engineering principles of designing such a “2-learner BMI” in which the brain and machine synergistically learn are not well understood. Hence, this proposal aims to investigate how the brain learns when the machine undergoes different degrees of learning, how different degrees of brain learning affect long-term BMI performance, robustness, and generalization, and how these principles can guide the design of a 2-learner BMI system which facilitates brain learning. The proposal is structured in three aims: 1) To study the impact of decoder adaptation on the development of neural encoding models underlying neuroprosthetic skill; 2) To Study how decoder adaptation and resultant neural encoding model influences BMI performance with perturbations (robustness) and BMI performance on unpracticed tasks (generalization); and 3) Design and validation of the next-generation Flexible 2-Learner Decoder architecture. The analyses and experiments proposed in these aims will leverage the fundamental knowledge gained about how the brain learns and acquires neuroprosthetic skills into the neurophysiologically-informed design of robust and high-performance closed-loop motor neuroprosthetics that generalize to new tasks.

"Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia Dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting movements and postures. Although basal ganglia dysfunction is consistently implicated across many forms of dystonia, the underlying pathophysiology is unknown. The major input structure of the basal ganglia is the striatum. The vast majority of neurons in the striatum are GABAergic spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs) project to the internal pallidum (GPi) to promote movement. Indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) project to the external pallidum (GPe) to inhibit movement. Although dSPNs and dSPNs are largely segregated into separate pathways, they act in concert and within ensembles of coactivity to select and refine movements. In dystonia patients, this coordinated activity appears to be disrupted as microelectrode recordings in dystonia patients reveal abnormal activity in both GPi and GPe. Although these results implicate abnormal activity in both dSPNs and iSPNs, the abnormal patterns of striatal activity that mediate dystonia are unknown. Several challenges have stymied our ability to understand the abnormal neural code underlying dystonia. First, the information obtained from microelectrode recording in patients is, by necessity, quite limited. Second, because dystonia is induced by movement, recordings must be made in awake unrestrained subjects to obtain authentic results. Third, to meaningfully understand striatal pathophysiology, it is necessary to distinguish between dSPNs and iSPNs, which is challenging to accomplish using microelectrode recordings in vivo because these two distinct cells types are intermingled within the striatum. With the recent development of lightweight miniature fluorescence microscopes that can be used to image the activity of genetically-identified SPNs in freely moving mice, we can overcome these obstacles to understand the physiological substrates of dystonia. For the first experiments to reveal abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia, we will use a knockin mouse model of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD) in which the striatum is known to play a central role in mediating the dystonia. In fact, both dSPN and iSPN signaling is disrupted in these mice. Thus, we now have an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate the neural code of dystonia for the first time. The Specific Aim is to identify abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia. We will test the hypothesis that dystonia is mediated by abnormal neuronal activity and degraded ensemble activity of dSPNs and iSPNs by performing in vivo Ca2+ imaging in freely moving normal or DRD mice that selectively express the GCaMP6f calcium indicator in either dSPNs or iSPNs. Abnormal firing patterns including the degree of spatial clustering of coactive neurons will be assessed using both well-established approaches and a novel analysis of population dynamics using a machine learning algorithm that we recently developed to identify and predict dystonia-specific neuronal ensemble firing patterns. Although dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after tremor and Parkinson’s disease, treatments for dystonia are inadequate because the underlying neuronal dysfunction is not well understood. Understanding abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia will provide a novel platform for the development of therapeutics that target the abnormal neural code, rather than the traditional one-drug-one-target approach.!",Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia,9957592,R21NS116311,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Code', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopa-Responsive Dystonia', 'Dopamine', 'Dopamine D1 Receptor', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor', 'Dopamine Receptor', 'Dystonia', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Human', 'Image', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Mutation', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Dynamics', 'Posture', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'awake', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence microscope', 'in vivo', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,427605,-0.02196845491910166
"Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures Epileptic seizures are unpredictable events that significantly reduce quality of life. Predicting when the next seizure would occur could both prepare persons with epilepsy and their caregivers, and potentially aid in the treatment of seizures. Animal models of epilepsy provide an opportunity to explore the nature of brain activity in the period leading up to seizures. Using both mouse and rat models of generalized absence epilepsy, we have found a specific build up of thalamic neural spiking activity for several seconds before each seizure. This novel electrophysiological signature occurs in the absence of any overt epileptiform EEG activity. We propose to identify the neural circuits that are responsible for pre-seizure activity using high-density multi-channel silicon probes to record broadly across seizure-generating networks in the mouse. We will also measure calcium ion levels, a readout of neural activity, in neuronal cell bodies and their output axons using fluorescent calcium indicators (GCaMPs) and multiphoton microscopy to capture a highly complementary component of pre-seizure activity with high spatial resolution. Neural activity data will be collected together with EEG, locomotion signals, sensory-evoked responses, and pupil diameter to create a comprehensive multimodal stream of pre-seizure activity. This information will be fed into unbiased machine learning approaches to develop predictive algorithms. We will directly test coupling strength within thalamocortical pre-seizure networks by conducting network-level and targeted single-cell recordings in acute brain slices. To determine a specific role of pre- seizure networks in generating seizures, we will test whether chemogenetic or optogenetic silencing of key pre-seizure network elements reduces seizure incidence or severity. Finally, we will test whether we can use seizure-predictive signals to intervene in real-time and prevent seizures before they take hold. Together, these experiments will provide proof of concept for a novel therapeutic approach: targeting the pre-seizure state to improve seizure control. The unpredictable nature of seizures is a burden on persons with epilepsy and their caregivers.

"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy in a double-blinded study of 75 subjects with chronic aphasia.

"Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication Project Summary/Abstract: Processing acoustic communication signals is among the most difficult yet vital abilities of the auditory system. These abilities lie at the heart of language and speech processing, and their success or failure has profound impacts on quality of life across the lifespan. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, and for improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders, such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. Non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans reveal the loci of language-related processing but do not answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. Thus, circuit-level neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing remain poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language. This proposal investigates neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing abilities shared between songbirds and humans. In Aim 1, we test the cellular-level predictions of a powerful modelling framework, called predictive coding, proposed as a general computational mechanism to support the learned recognition of complex temporally patterned signals at multiple timescales. We combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods with multi-electrode electrophysiology, to test explicit models for natural stimulus representation, prediction, and error coding in single cortical neurons and neural populations. One aspect of auditory perception integral to speech is the discretization of the signal into learned categorically perceived sounds (phonemes). In Aim 2, we use the predictive coding framework to investigate the learned categorical perception of natural auditory categories in populations of cortical neurons. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent phonemes can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Aim2 also examines how categorical neural representations are affected by temporal context. In addition to which phonemes occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Songbirds also attend to the statistical regularities in their vocal communication signals. In Aim 3, we focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication,9939507,R01DC018055,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'bird song', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'learned behavior', 'machine learning method', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'pattern perception', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,334688,-0.07547705020343878
"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"Electrical connectomics: an innovative approach for dissecting brain mechanisms underlying behavioral states Project Summary: Understanding the mechanisms by which the brain encodes behavior presents a major challenge for developing effective therapies with which to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. The development of brain-wide measurements of neural connectivity in mammalian models holds great potential for overcoming this challenge. Here we propose an innovative approach for collecting and integrating such data across an unprecedented number of interconnected brain regions for use in elucidating the mechanisms by which sensory processing is altered in disease. A number of neurological and psychiatric disorders are triggered or exacerbated by sensory stimuli, yet little is understood about the brain connectivity underlying such sensory hyper/hypo- sensitization. Sensory processing plays a major role in the pathology of: autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, fibromyalgia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sensory perception disorders (SPDs), and migraine. Migraine in particular represents a compelling model of sensory hypersensitization, as the response to sensory stimuli is clear, dose- dependent, and measurable. Using state-of-the-art, multi-site in vivo recordings in a well- characterized migraine model, coupled with machine learning, we will develop network-wide electrical maps of the sensory hypersensitivity that underlies migraine. These networks will be validated for their roles in migraine using multiple behavioral assays and migraine-related pharmacological manipulations. We will additionally dissect the mechanisms underlying the sensory hypersensitivity brain state in a mouse model of migraine using optogenetic circuit manipulations as well as single-cell RNA-Seq, with the aim of identifying the contributions of specific circuits, cells, and molecules to this state. This approach is expected to substantially facilitate the use of neural oscillation-based brain networks in biomedical research, as well as provide: 1) a tool for rapid identification of a sensory hypersensitive brain state that can be tested for mechanisms shared across disorders, 2) a map of features of electrical brain networks, which serve as strong hypotheses regarding the routes whereby sensory hypersensitivity brain networks are regulated, and 3) insight into the contributions of specific cell types and molecules to the hypersensitive brain state. Collectively, this study is expected to provide insights into the etiology of migraine and other sensory hypersensitivity disorders that will be critical to developing brain network-based therapies for these diseases. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: This proposal seeks to harness a powerful approach for mapping electrical activity across the brain and to use this information to dissect the biological mechanisms underlying sensory hypersensitivity, a key aspect of many neurological and psychiatric disorders. The data collected from this study will provide a comprehensive map of electrical activity in sensory hypersensitivity in a preclinical migraine model; migraine is the most prevalent neurological disorder in the general population. These maps will then be used to identify novel brain-network based targets for the development of new therapeutics, establishing a unique approach that could be applied broadly to many brain disorders for which effective therapies remain elusive.",Electrical connectomics: an innovative approach for dissecting brain mechanisms underlying behavioral states,10001808,DP2MH126377,"['Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Etiology', 'Fibromyalgia', 'General Population', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Pathology', 'Perceptual Disorders', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Route', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Testing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cell type', 'effective therapy', 'hypersensitivity desensitization', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,DP2,2020,2317500,-0.02887026425719656
"Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory- motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.” Project Narrative Motor development plays a crucial role in the acquisition of social communication skills, cognition, and language, and motor impairments detrimentally affect downstream development. Many neurodevelopmental disorders describe motor impairments as an early comorbid symptom; however, current standardized assessments of motor function fail to clearly characteize these early motor impairments. This longitudinal study will utilize quantitative measures to objectively characterize the earliest manifestation of motor impairments in infants at high risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and elucidate the mechanistic relationship of these impairments to symptoms of autism and other adverse developmental outcomes with the goal to improve early identification and inform targeted interventions.",Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders,9977506,K23HD099275,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Life Experience', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal Brain Injury', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Space Perception', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual Motor Coordinations', 'advanced analytics', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'standardize measure', 'statistics', 'study population', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2020,177444,-0.022924776810529648
"CRCNS:  Neural Basis of Planning Humans and other animals can choose their actions using multiple learning algorithms and decision­ making strategies. For example, habitual behaviors adapted to a stable environment can be selected using so-called model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, in which the value of each action is incrementally updated according to the amount of unexpected reward. The underlying neural mechanisms for this type of reinforcement learning have been intensively studied. By contrast, how the brain utilizes the animal's knowledge of its environment to plan sequential actions using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm remains unexplored. In this application, PIs with complementary expertise will investigate how different subdivisions of the primate prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and arbitration of different learning algorithms during strategic planning in primates, using a sequential game referred to as ""4-in-a­ row"". Previous studies have revealed that with training, humans improve their competence in this game by gradually switching away from a model-free reinforcement learning towards a model-based reinforcement learning in the form of a tree search. In the first set of experiments, we will train non-human primates to play the 4-in-a-row game against a computer opponent. We predict that the complexity of the strategic planning and the opponent's move violating the animal's expectation will be reflected in the speed of animal's action and pupil diameters. Next, we will test how the medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and selection of different learning algorithms during strategic interaction between the animal and computer opponent. We hypothesize that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in computing the integrated values of alternative actions originating from multiple sources and guiding the animal's choice, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex might be more involved in monitoring and resolving the discrepancies of actions favored by different learning algorithms. The results from these experiments will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms for complex strategic planning and unify various approaches to study naturalistic behaviors. By taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning and decision neuroscience, proposed studies will elucidate how multiple learning algorithms are simultaneously implemented and coordinated via specific patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex. The results from these studies will transform the behavioral and analytical paradigms used to study high-order planning and their neural underpinnings in humans and animals. Strategic planning is commonly impaired in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and depression, but their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. The proposed studies will elucidate the role of prefrontal cortex in implementing and arbitrating between multiple learning algorithms used for strategic planning.",CRCNS:  Neural Basis of Planning,9929660,R01MH118925,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Structures', 'Animals', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Update', 'base', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fictional works', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'source guides']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,387421,-0.013981427806465921
"Combining Physiological, Genetic, and Computational Approaches with Naturalistic Climbing Behavior to Elucidate the Functional Elements of Descending Motor Control PROJECT SUMMARY Many mammals are distinguished by the exceptional diversity and agility of their limb movement. These qualities are critical to the fitness certain movements confer, and so to the evolutionary success of many species. While brain regions important for limb control have been identified, the neural signal processing that ultimately governs motor commands sent to muscles has remained stubbornly opaque. Mechanistic models of motor system operation in real time during movement are thus lacking. This obscures the etiology of motor deficits caused by neurological disease and stroke, which in turn stymies the development of effective treatments.  A primary cause of this opacity of motor system processing is the ambiguity of the basic functional elements comprising relevant neural circuits. An emerging view posits that these elements may be neuronal subtypes defined by features like axonal target region, target cell identity, and gene expression. Yet the fundamental question of what are the appropriate cellular features for defining functional units remains unanswered. This ambiguity stems from a host of technical limitations. We expect that functionally salient neuronal subtypes will make characteristic contributions to specific phases of movement. Yet traditional methods for silencing neural activity to assess function lack the temporal resolution to discern such specific influence. We also expect that functionally salient subtypes will exhibit distinct activity patterns and interactions with other neuronal populations. But classical methods for measuring neural firing are typically blind to key cellular features. Moreover, the behavioral paradigms used for motor system studies have not captured essential aspects of natural mammalian movement, for which motor system organization may have been adapted over evolution.  Fortunately though, systems neuroscience is currently being revolutionized by advances in physiological, genetic, and computational techniques. I plan to leverage many of these advances and pursue an innovative approach to resolve the basic functional elements within a model motor system population – the subcerebral projection neurons (SPNs) found in motor areas of the neocortex. We will employ a naturalistic climbing paradigm for mice engineered in my lab to overcome limitations of previous motor behavior paradigms. New genetically- mediated targeting strategies will provide access to potential functional subtypes for activity measurement and perturbation. We will novelly couple optogenetic probes, electromyography, and automated behavior decomposition to distinguish precise phases of neuronal subtype influence. Large-scale, multi-area activity recording, optogenetic identification, and machine learning will parse subtypes by their activity and interactions with other neuronal populations. Our work will articulate an interdisciplinary approach applicable to the fundamental question of functional units in other neural systems as well. The mechanistic insight our work begins to build will help elucidate the etiology of movement deficits stemming from conditions like ALS and Huntington’s disease, and following stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our project aims to identify basic functional elements within motor circuits to help build mechanistic models of motor system operation in real time during movement execution. The lack of such models has sharply limited our understanding of the etiology of motor deficits stemming from neurological disease and stroke, which in turn stymies the development of effective treatment. The mechanistic insight our work builds will thus help elucidate the etiology of motor deficits and facilitate improved treatment.","Combining Physiological, Genetic, and Computational Approaches with Naturalistic Climbing Behavior to Elucidate the Functional Elements of Descending Motor Control",10002981,DP2NS120847,"['Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Computational Technique', 'Development', 'Electromyography', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Huntington Disease', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'blind', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'limb movement', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'stem', 'success', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,DP2,2020,2340462,-0.03971319014819316
"A novel geometric paradigm for nonlinear modeling and control of neural dynamics PROJECT SUMMARY A standing challenge in neuroscience is to control the activity of large populations of interconnected neurons that underlie our brain’s functions and dysfunctions. The dynamics of these neural activity patterns are immensely complex and nonlinear, making their modeling extremely difficult. Thus, the precise control of neural dynamics and the associated mental states using stimulation input has remained elusive to date. If precise dynamic modeling and control was possible, this would both elucidate the neural basis of behavior and treat the most prevalent and disabling mental disorders such as depression or addiction, which are a leading cause of disability worldwide. The goal of this innovative proposal is to move toward making this vision a reality. We will: (1) develop a novel biologically-informed geometric paradigm to achieve nonlinear dynamic modeling and closed-loop control of neural population activity; (2) demonstrate it on brain network activity collected from the monkey motor system and the human corticolimbic system to characterize the neural dynamics of complex movements and control the neural biomarkers of depressed mood, respectively. This geometric paradigm will be based on a central idea: if we learn and model the low-dimensional nonlinear geometric space over which neural population activity evolves in time, we can then analytically write the dynamic model in a much simpler form over this manifold; this will allow for precise modeling of nonlinear dynamics and enable their control, which is otherwise impractical. Capturing the nonlinearity in the geometry to achieve control of brain dynamics with unprecedented precision is a major innovation and departure from current methods. We introduce concepts from algebraic topology and differential geometry into neural dynamic modeling and control. We will develop new methods at the interface of these disciplines, neuroscience, machine learning and control theory to: (1) identify the type of manifold that embeds neural dynamics (e.g., torus or sphere); (2) develop novel algorithms that learn analytical dynamic models over this manifold (both with and without stimulation input); (3) build decoders and controllers of neural dynamics that incorporate the biologically-informed nonlinear geometric models. We will provide three rigorous experimental demonstrations on rich data from two distinct neural systems: (i) existing spike-field activity from monkey motor cortices during complex reach-and-grasps; (ii) existing multisite intracranial human brain activity in the corticolimbic system with simultaneous mood tracking; (iii) new closed-loop control experiments to selectively modulate brain network activity underlying mood states in the corticolimbic system using electrical stimulation. The paradigm will provide a new tool to build interpretable, low-dimensional, and controllable nonlinear models of neural dynamics to elucidate the neural basis of behavior and disease. Also, it will achieve nonlinear closed- loop control of neural dynamics underlying mental states and lead to closed-loop brain stimulation systems that could transform treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression or addiction for millions of patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed geometric paradigm for dynamic modeling and closed-loop control of nonlinear brain dynamics will provide a new scientific tool to study neural mechanisms in health and disease, and innovative closed-loop controllers of mental states with unprecedented precision to facilitate precisely-tailored stimulation treatments for a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and addiction.

"Cracking the Olfactory Code Project Summary (Overall: Cracking the Olfactory Code)  Sensation drives perception, which informs decisions and actions. Olfaction is the main sense used by most animals to interact with the environment. However, olfaction remains shrouded in mystery — we do not know which molecular odorant features matter to the olfactory system and which do not, how information about these features is recombined to create holistic odor representations within the brain, or how those representations relate to perception. As a consequence, we lack an empirical understanding of the core transformations taking place at each stage of olfactory processing, which ultimately lead to perception and behavior. In addition, we lack a clear theoretical framework for understanding how a stimulus space that is both discrete and high-dimensional yields a perceptual space that is continuous and low dimensional. Because the olfactory system is “shallow” — meaning that within two synapses information about complete odor objects is abstracted and generalized — understanding this specific circuit will also afford general insight both into architecturally-related allocortical brain regions critical to behavior (e.g., cerebellum, hippocampus), and into cortical centers that play a key role in integrating diverse sources of information (e.g., prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex). Here we propose to reveal the computational logic of olfaction by collecting the first system-wide dataset of neural and perceptual responses to a large, principled set of odorants, and by applying a unified statistical and theoretical approach to its interpretation. This project will convene research groups with expertise that spans neurobiology, and will leverage recent technical advances in molecular genetics, neural imaging, electrophysiology, opto- and chemogenetics, human psychophysics, and machine learning to interrogate all levels (from peripheral receptors to cortex to perceptual and behavioral output) of the olfactory system. Taken together, these experiments will establish a reference dataset that reveals the key transformations performed by the olfactory system, test a key unifying theory for olfaction, and create a community-wide resource that will prompt new theory and experiment. This work will also have wide-ranging implications for our general understanding of how sensory information is organized in the brain to facilitate adaptive action. Project Narrative (Overall) The brain builds rich internal representations of the external world in order to support perception and behavior. Here we take advantage of the architectural simplicity of the mammalian olfactory system — and an interdisciplinary team whose expertise ranges from molecular genetics and optogenetic to machine learning and human psychophysics — to characterize how odor information is sequentially transformed by neural circuits to generate meaningful perception. This work will both address longstanding mysteries about the inner workings of the olfactory system, and reveal general principles that govern how the brain organizes and processes information.",Cracking the Olfactory Code,10001592,U19NS112953,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Frequencies', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sense Organs', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic manipulation', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging approach', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'neural circuit', 'new technology', 'novel', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory receptor', 'olfactory stimulus', 'optogenetics', 'piriform cortex', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'stimulus processing', 'theories', 'working group']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U19,2020,2773998,-0.016436082468156823
"Chemogenetic afferent modulation to understand spinal cord circuit function and plasticity post injury PROJECT SUMMARY Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes life-long neurological impairment, and there is currently no effective treatment. The premise of this proposal is recent work demonstrating that afferent stimulation paired with treadmill training can enhance standing, stepping, and volitional control in humans and animal models. Therefore, it is critically important to understand the mechanisms by which afferent stimulation drives motor improvement. Tools that can identify which afferents are necessary and sufficient to enhance recovery, and that can facilitate characterization of the helpful neural plasticity, are urgently needed. Our long-term goal is to develop approaches for selective afferent modulation, and apply them to the dissection of the mechanisms underlying recovery from SCI. The objective of this grant is to identify which sets of afferents are important for recovery and how spinal circuits change to facilitate it. To achieve selective modulation of afferents and enable genetic tracing we will use Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) that can modulate excitability in specific populations of neurons. To accurately quantify improvement, we will use Deep Learning to analyze large kinematic data sets. Our preliminary data shows strong expression of DREADDs in large diameter DRG neurons, that their activation by CNO can excite or inhibit the H-reflex, and that activation of excitatory DREADDs during treadmill training post-SCI improves stepping. Our main hypothesis is that activation of large afferents by the excitatory DREADD (hM3Dq) during treadmill training will enhance recovery, whereas inhibitory DREADDs (hM4Di) will suppress recovery. Four sub- hypotheses will test whether recovery is mediated by increased afferent projection onto 1) motor neurons, or 2) inhibitory interneurons; or by sprouting of 3) reticulospinal and 4) propriospinal circuits. Our Specific Aims are to determine whether selective expression of DREADDs in (Aim 1) all large diameter (proprioceptive and tactile) neurons and (Aim 2) large proprioceptive afferents only can enhance recovery. The rationale for these aims is that afferent stimulation is hypothesized to work through selective excitation of large diameter sensory afferents (LDSA) that both drive motor pools locally and facilitate proprio- and surpraspinal input. To date, it has not been possible to definitively determine which afferents were recruited after electrical stimulation, or to select between afferents of similar diameter. The significance of this work lies in determining whether recovery is mediated exclusively by proprioceptive axons or a combination of proprioceptive and tactile afferents, and uncovering the mechanisms of functional plasticity in the spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 300,000 individuals are living with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the USA without an effective treatment. Recently, spinal cord stimulation during rehabilitation has been found to enable better standing, stepping, and voluntary control in patients with SCI. This study will improve our understanding of these mechanisms by 1) using new genetic tools to identify which afferents are necessary and sufficient for improvement, and 2) using genetic tracing techniques to uncover how spinal circuits are changing to enhance function.",Chemogenetic afferent modulation to understand spinal cord circuit function and plasticity post injury,10051492,R01NS114007,"['Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Caliber', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dissection', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'H-Reflex', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Locomotor Recovery', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue', 'Outcome', 'Parvalbumins', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Contusions', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Synapses', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toes', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'density', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'effective therapy', 'feeding', 'functional plasticity', 'human model', 'improved', 'injury recovery', 'kinematics', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'sensory input', 'tool', 'treadmill training', 'vector']",NINDS,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2020,416293,-0.026756562614646158
"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function. Thus the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission to reduce illness and disability.",CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System,10016303,R01EY029998,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intelligence', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Macaca', 'Masks', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosopagnosia', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Shapes', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'developmental prosopagnosia', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'success', 'theories']",NEI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,265973,-0.036165671693297145
"Prefrontal contributions to contextual representation Project Abstract/Summary This application describes a 3-year training plan that will enable me, a cognitive neuroscientist with prior training in electroencephalography (EEG), to conduct research on contextual memory representation using neuroimaging (fMRI) and computational modeling. EEG is useful for examining the timing properties of neural activity, but cannot localize activity to specific regions of the brain. In this proposal, I will receive training on a high-spatial resolution neuroimaging technique (fMRI), which will allow me to develop theories of neural function that are constrained by both space and time. I will also build on my prior degree in applied statistics and receive additional training in computational neuroscience, which will enable me to develop computational theories at the macro-circuit level. I will be supervised by Dr. Sharon Thompson-Schill, an expert fMRI experimentalist and theorist of lateral prefrontal cortex function, who has extensive experience researching the context-dependent nature of semantic memory. I will be co-supervised by Dr. Anna Schapiro, an expert on statistical learning and computational modeling of the brain. I propose to examine how prefrontal cortex (PFC) represents statistical dependencies among sequentially presented visual and auditory input. I will examine how the temporal extent and level of abstraction of sequential representations changes across ventral PFC. This will connect findings from several literatures, ranging from decision-making to emotion processing and language comprehension, within a single unifying framework. In addition, I will explore whether ‘deep’ or ‘shallow’ recurrent neural networks better capture the sensitivity profile of ventral PFC, informing the question of whether the brain conducts ‘deep’ learning. In Aim 1, I will conduct behavioral piloting and collect data for two neuroimaging experiments on hierarchical sequential processing. I will have participants learn the statistical properties of hierarchically organized sequences of abstract visual (Aim 1a&b) and auditory (Aim 1b) images. I then test for neural sensitivity to statistical learning at each hierarchical level using pattern similarity analysis, comparing the neural response to the sequences before and after learning. In Aim 2, I will conduct computational modeling of the neuroimaging data in Aim 1, with held out data to ensure robustness and reproducibility. I compare the neuroimaging data to internal model representations derived from single-layer (‘shallow’) and multi-layer (‘deep’) recurrent neural networks trained on the same sequences as the humans in Aim 1. By modeling the neural representation of context itself, the current proposal will help fill a critical gap in our understanding of how the brain predicts upcoming sensory input, enabling rapid processing of the world around us. It will also inform our understanding of several psychiatric disorders that involve prefrontal cortex disfunction and disturbances of contextual processing, such as schizophrenia, anxiety and depression. Project Narrative As we navigate the world we are bombarded by a flood of sensations that our brain must rapidly make sense of, and understanding the context we are in as it relates to the likelihood of upcoming experiences is important for enhancing the speed and accuracy of this process. This proposal examines how sensory context is represented in the brain, by having people learn statistical regularities in artificial sequences of images and syllables and modeling neural activity in prefrontal cortex as they are exposed to different sensory “contexts” using fMRI. Through computational modeling of prefrontal cortex, we can enhance our understanding of the function of a brain region implicated in many neuropsychological disorders where the perception of context is distorted or disrupted, including anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia.",Prefrontal contributions to contextual representation,9990118,F32MH123002,"['Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Esthesia', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Floods', 'Fractals', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grain', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'interest', 'language comprehension', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sequence learning', 'social', 'sound', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'theories']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F32,2020,64926,-0.0015510895570574352
"Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in the United States, affecting 4% of all adults over the age of 40. For individuals whose motor symptoms are refractory to medication and significantly impair their daily living, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered to be the only bilateral therapeutic option. Despite recent advances in DBS technology, a significant portion of ET patients with DBS implants will receive inadequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads, while others will lose efficacy of the therapy after 1-2 years due in part to inflexible neurostimulator programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs and programming algorithms that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields within the brain, especially in cases where stimulation through a poorly placed DBS lead results in low-threshold side-effects. Our proposed study will integrate high-field magnetic resonance imaging, histological neurotracing of fiber pathways, computational modeling of DBS, and single-cell electrophysiology methods to further develop and experimentally-validate a novel semi-automated machine learning algorithm that facilitates hypothesis-driven determination of subject-specific neurostimulator settings through directional DBS leads. Specifically, we will: 1) identify the neural pathways involved in the reduction of action and postural tremor using directional DBS leads and a novel particle swarm optimization algorithm based on subject-specific anatomy; 2) quantify how tremor-related information is modulated on the single-cell, population, and network levels by therapeutic DBS in a preclinical large-animal model of harmline-induced tremor; and 3) investigate how therapeutic windows (i.e. the threshold difference between postural and action tremor abolishment and side effect emergence) change over time with human DBS therapy targeting one or more pathways within the cerebello-thalamoc-cortical network. Together, this project will (a) experimentally evaluate and translate a novel DBS programming algorithm to human ET patients, (b) provide a much more detailed map of the neural pathways underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS (on postural and action tremor) and side effects of DBS (on dysarthria, paresthesia, ataxia), (c) rigorously investigate how DBS for treating tremor works mechanistically at the single cell and network levels within the brain, and (d) probe the neural pathways involved in the worsening of tremor symptoms for ET patients over time. NARRATIVE Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a proven therapy for patients with medication-refractory essential tremor, but a significant portion of patients with these implants do not receive adequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads or inflexible DBS programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields in the brain to improve the functional outcome for all patients requiring DBS to manage their essential tremor. Our research study will experimentally evaluate a novel machine learning algorithm for programming directional DBS leads implanted within thalamus to more precisely identify and effectively target the pathways and circuits involved in (a) cessation of action and postural tremor, and (b) worsening of tremor symptoms over time.",Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor,9962505,R01NS081118,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dysarthria', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Essential Tremor', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Harmaline', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intention Tremor', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Paresthesia', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Primates', 'Radiation', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tremor', 'United States', 'Utah', 'Work', 'arm', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'deep brain stimulation array', 'density', 'design', 'electric field', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic field', 'motor symptom', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'particle', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'research study', 'side effect', 'somatosensory', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'zona incerta']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,549049,-0.003459180928517467
"Model-based credit assignment Abstract How the brain forms, tunes, and uses predictive models that specify the causal links between stimuli in the environment, our choices, and their outcomes is a fundamental question in Psychology and Neuroscience. A great deal of progress has been made identifying the neural computations theorized to form and update predictive models. This research has played a central role in the rise of computational psychiatry, but its relevance to clinical disorders has been limited in part by the use of relatively simple learning/choice paradigms that capture only a narrow subset of the structural complexity of real-world learning.  In order to make sound predictions in a complex world, the brain needs to attribute good and bad outcomes to their most likely causes, a problem known as “credit assignment”. There is little understanding of how outcomes are attributed to their most likely causes in structured real-world environments. Most real-world learning occurs in complex and structured environments, such as hierarchical systems (e.g. seasonal events, social hierarchies, contextual rules, etc.). Recent evidence suggests that humans can use an understanding of the environment’s causal structure to attribute outcomes to their most likely causes (which I call “model-based credit assignment)”, rather than simply attributing them to the most recently experienced stimuli and choices that were made (which I call “model-free” credit assignment), as standard models have proposed.  The purpose of the present proposal is to develop the first neural model of model-based credit assignment. We hypothesize that the brain reinstates the cause when a reinforcement outcome is experienced to associate with the outcome. In other words, so that “fire-together/wire-together” plasticity mechanisms can link a choice with an outcome, the choice representation and the outcome representation must both be active at the same time even though the causal choice or event may have actually occurred some time beforehand.  To test this and other predictions, we will integrate mathematical descriptions of learning and decision making with “representational” analysis methods that allow inferences to be made about the information represented in brain areas, applied to fMRI and scalp EEG data. fMRI will reveal how neural learning signals update neural representations of likely causes during learning, while EEG will reveal the timing of the hypothesized reinstatement. These experiments will set the stage to apply the insights gained to investigate how the brain attributes outcomes to more abstract “latent” causes in hierarchically structured environments prevalent in the real world. The proposed project will thus move this general program of research strategy toward learning tasks that better reflect the complexity and structure in many real-world learning/choice situations important for both typical and atypical individuals. Project Narrative Research into how the brain forms and tunes predictive models that specify the causal relationships between stimuli in the environment, our actions, and their outcomes has made dramatic strides by identifying key learning computations in the brain in both typical and atypical individuals. However, the application of this research to clinical disorders has been limited by use of relatively simple learning/choice tasks that do not capture much of the structural complexity of real-world learning. The present project aims to develop the first neural model specifying how reinforcement outcomes are attributed to their most likely causes in such structured environments.",Model-based credit assignment,10064687,R56MH119116,"['Address', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Clams', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Restaurants', 'Role', 'Scallop', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Service delivery model', 'Shellfish', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Hierarchy', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Weight', 'base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'insight', 'neural model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'shellfish hypersensitivity', 'sound', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2020,385349,0.0053366875292681516
"Center for Mesoscale Mapping Overview of the Proposed Resource – Abstract The goal of the Center for Mesoscale Mapping is to drive the convergence of microscopic- and macroscopic- scale evaluation of brain structure and function for human translational neuroscience, by developing and applying tools to study the spatial distribution and temporal orchestration of mesoscopic events in the human brain. Our Collaborators will, through a dynamic “push-pull” relationship, provide unique problems which drive the development of these tools, and in return guide us in the design and optimization of our toolbox for practical use in a variety of normal and disease settings. While there is still no formal consensus on the definition of mesoscopic within the neuroscience community, we take as our guide the spatial and temporal scales at which local groups of neurons act in coherent fashion – in the cortex, this includes the spatial scale of columns and laminar structures (between ~0.1-1 mm), while in deeper structures includes the myriad of deep brain and brainstem nuclei. Preliminary data from our own center, and of course others throughout the world, now support the notion that we are on the threshold of being able to map, measure and perturb the human brain at these scales, and do so comprehensively across wide swaths of the human brain. Temporally too, recent advances suggest a convergence between temporal scales addressable with tools like fMRI, which can now investigate delta frequency coherent phenomena, and advanced electromagnetic tools to measure and perturb coherent electrophysiological activity at higher frequencies still. With this convergence in mind, the tools we proposed to develop within the TRDs of the CMM will provide our Collaborative and Service User community with the important “missing links” between the advances in human cognitive neuroscience at the “system level,” and the enormous strides in cellular level circuit functional characterization. Our Collaborators will bring their own unique challenges to help us define and further refine these tools, offering problems requiring distinct measures of human brain structural and functional properties in a variety of normal and disease settings. Our Service Users will utilize our tools to better understand human neural systems, and particularly human disease states from multiple sclerosis to Alzheimer’s, to depression and epilepsy. Finally, our Center will seek to disseminate these tools, through open-source software and hardware designs, industrial partnerships and “hands-on” teaching courses for hardware, and to train a new generation of human neuroscientists in the use of our advanced tools to explore the human brain at this next frontier.

"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,10001503,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visualization', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2020,7509,-0.004651992469144229
"Neurocognitive deficits and compensation in binge drinkers ABSTRACT  Binge or heavy episodic drinking has been on the rise and is associated with a range of harmful consequences that scale up with the high intensity drinking prevalent among young adults. Evidence on the nature and extent of neural changes associated with binge drinking (BD) is scant, especially as regards sex differences, so more sensitive, high-precision imaging modalities are needed to examine persistent brain alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based methods are sensitive to brain function, as well as different neural tissue properties, and are well suited to provide multidimensional insight into the structure and organization of the brain. Despite a paucity of neuroimaging studies in BD, evidence obtained from individuals with alcohol use disorder suggests that degradation of prefrontal functions may contribute to impaired executive functions and an inability to refrain from hazardous drinking. Consistent with findings in alcohol use disorder, our data and other evidence indicate that BD participants show compensatory engagement of additional brain areas to maintain adequate performance on cognitively demanding tasks. Complementary MRI modalities can reveal the nature and regional specificity of structural degradation that underlies and constrains the compensatory reorganization.  The overall aim of this project is to use a range of MRI-based methods to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult binge drinking men and women. Because of their spatial precision and sensitivity to different neural tissue properties and functional features, MRI-based methods can provide insights into structural and functional alterations at the level of an interactive system. Specifically, BOLD fMRI will evaluate functional activation during tasks that probe cognitive control; resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis will examine alterations at the level of a functional network, while structural degradation will be reflected in gray and white matter morphometric features. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will characterize white matter microstructure and tract-based changes. These measures will be obtained from young adult men and women (18-30 yrs) who will be assigned to binge drinking (BD) and light drinking (LD) groups based on their drinking patterns and will be equated on age, race/ethnicity, and family history of alcoholism. Interactions between binge drinking and sex will be examined in all analyses. Overall, we hypothesize that neural alterations will correlate with a range of alcohol-related variables, with greater deficits and increased compensatory activity observed in BDs who engage in higher intensity drinking, with BD women being especially susceptible to functional deficits and structural degradation. Data will be integrated across imaging modalities in a machine learning classifier framework that will inform a predictive model of drinking trajectories based on 6-mos and 12-mos longitudinal follow-ups. Combined with a rich set of drinking indices, personality and behavioral variables, a constellation of brain measures will provide a mechanistic insight into the type and extend of the neural degradation underlying executive deficits and compensatory brain reorganization. NARRATIVE  The overall aim of this project is to use a multimodal MRI approach to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult men and women engaging in binge drinking.

"Receptors, microcircuits and hierarchical connectivity in predictive coding and sensory awareness SUMMARY The standard view of how we make sense of the world around us focuses on reconstructing our environment from the information received by our sensory organs. In this view, low-level brain areas (e.g., primary sensory cortex) represent basic features of objects, which are elaborated on in successive processing stages, until representations become increasingly complex in high-level areas (e.g., frontal cortex). An alternative view is predictive coding (PC), in which we model our environment to generate sensory predictions. In PC, high-level brain areas generate predictions of sensory activity and transmit them to low-level areas. A prediction that does not match the sensory information gives rise to a prediction error. This error signal is sent from low- to high-level brain areas to update the model of our environment, thereby improving future predictions to minimize errors. Modeling studies show PC is a fast and efficient way to process sensory information, and PC provides innovative hypotheses for understanding sleep and anesthesia, particularly when disconnected consciousness occurs (consciousness without awareness of the environment), like dreaming. PC also holds great promise for conceptualizing and treating brain disorders, including schizophrenia and depression. But key central features of PC have not been empirically tested and little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms. The goal of the proposed project is to characterize the neural dynamics, circuits and receptors enabling PC. There are two principle hypotheses. First, predictions depend on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) because NMDAR influence the activity of high-level brain areas where predictions are generated, and NMDAR are enriched on neurons in lower-level areas receiving predictions. Second, in disconnected consciousness, a breakdown of information transmission from low-level to high-level brain areas, as well as a breakdown of computations within each area, explains why models of our environment are not updated by external sensory information. These breakdowns prevent the comparison of predictions and sensory information, as well as the transmission of prediction errors to high-level brain areas. To test these hypotheses, we use a cross-species experimental design connecting cellular, circuit and systems levels to behavior. We will perform electroencephalography, machine learning and computational modeling to define the neural basis of PC in humans performing prediction tasks. Then we will manipulate PC using different anesthetic agents with diverse mechanisms, establishing causal relationships between receptors, large-scale brain networks and PC. In parallel, we will simultaneously record activity from sensory and high-level brain areas of non-human primates (NHPs) using the same PC tasks and pharmacological interventions to measure cellular and circuit level contributions to PC. Investigating PC will illuminate the fundamental mechanisms of perception, providing critical insights to guide therapeutic development for multiple health conditions. NARRATIVE This research advances our understanding of how the brain generates predictions which shape how we perceive the world, otherwise known as predictive coding. Predictive coding is relevant to public health because it holds great promise in conceptualizing and treating brain disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, delirium and dementia, as well as understanding sleep and anesthesia. Progress in understanding the basic mechanisms of predictive coding, as well as predictive coding deficits, is a necessary step in developing more effective treatment strategies for multiple health conditions.","Receptors, microcircuits and hierarchical connectivity in predictive coding and sensory awareness",10034682,R01NS117901,"['Adrenergic Receptor', 'Agonist', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Conscious', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Dementia', 'Dexmedetomidine', 'Disinhibition', 'Dose', 'Dreams', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Ketamine', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Propofol', 'Public Health', 'Pulvinar structure', 'Reaction Time', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Study models', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Unconscious State', 'Update', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'human data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'paired stimuli', 'postsynaptic', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sedative', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'therapeutic development', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,517182,-0.014449328827325102
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need. Deep understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes in health and disease will translate into identifying novel therapeutic avenues for treatment of brain disorders.",Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools,9852566,R01MH110504,"['Address', 'Astrocytes', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Peer Review', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'complex data ', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimmunology', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2020,510889,-0.006862868445451829
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD,9961678,R01NS100849,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction Time', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos', 's', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,75097,-0.024445663694040422
"DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease Abstract Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the most effective treatments for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Delivery of high frequency electrical stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) ameliorates parkinsonian motor symptoms, often within seconds, but therapeutic effects wear off quickly if stimulation is stopped, often within minutes. This transient nature of symptomatic relief underscores the fact that existing DBS protocols mask symptoms but do not alleviate underlying circuit dysfunction. A modified DBS protocol, called coordinated reset (CR-DBS), has shown potential to provide long-lasting therapeutic benefits for days to weeks after stimulation, but this protocol has been slow to translate into widespread clinical use because (1) the multi- site, pseudorandom stimulation patterns required to implement it cannot be delivered with existing devices and (2) its mechanisms of action remain obscure, hindering insights into what parameters of CR-DBS should be tuned to ensure engagement of long-lasting effects. Recently, in a mouse model of PD, we discovered a cellular- based strategy to induce long-lasting motor recovery, by using optogenetics to target interventions to specific neuronal subpopulations in the external globus pallidus (GPe), an anatomical neighbor of the STN. Long-lasting motor rescue was induced by interventions that simultaneously increased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in parvalbumin (PV-GPe) and decreased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in lim homeobox 6 (Lhx6-GPe). Interestingly, at the physiological level, these cell-type specific interventions in the GPe converged upon a similar mechanism as CR-DBS, by ameliorating pathological patterns of neural activity in basal ganglia output nuclei that have been associated with parkinsonian motor deficits. This proposal will use knowledge gained from our discovery of long-lasting rescue through cell-type directed interventions in GPe to guide rational design and interrogation of human-applicable forms of DBS that may yield similarly long-lasting therapeutic benefit. Our experiments will test a novel, mechanistic hypothesis, based on supporting preliminary data, that the pattern of electrical DBS can be tuned to drive cell-type specific responses in the GPe that mirror those previously found to be sufficient to induce of long-lasting motor rescue with optogenetics. Experiments in Aim 1 will investigate the cellular mechanisms through which phasic stimulation in the STN evokes cell-type specific responses in the GPe (Aim 1.1) and use a machine learning approach to identify stimulation protocols that maximize this cell-type specific response (Aim 1.2). Experiments in Aim 2 will test the therapeutic efficacy of phasic stimulation protocols compared to conventional DBS, using behavioral and physiological assays in mouse (Aim 2.1) and primate (Aim 2.2) models of PD. Taken together, these experiments will advance our understanding of the fundamental differences between how conventional vs. phasic stimulation impacts the nervous system, with cell-type specific and synapse-specific resolution, and could provide novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly translated into humans. Project Narrative Conventional DBS is an effective therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), but its therapeutic effects decay rapidly once stimulation is turned off, underscoring the fact that it masks symptoms but does not reverse underlying circuit dysfunction. Based on foundational research into the cell-type organization of basal ganglia circuits, this proposal develops and tests the therapeutic efficacy of electrical stimulation protocols designed to selectively recruit therapeutic cell populations within the external globus pallidus (GPe) of the basal ganglia. The collaborative project will test the efficacy and therapeutic duration of novel stimulation protocols in mouse and primate models of PD.",DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease,9996149,R01NS117058,"['Acute', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Dopamine', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Homeobox', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'STN stimulation', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Solid', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'motor deficit', 'motor recovery', 'motor symptom', 'mouse model', 'neural patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'response', 'side effect', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'translation to humans']",NINDS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,641051,-0.0033131115386946797
"PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry Project Summary Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research, there has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. Such sharing, evaluation, and integration are necessary if computational modeling efforts are to be useful not only in generating reliable and accurate accounts of how brain subsystems operate, but also of how they interact to give rise to higher cognitive functions, and how disruptions of such interactions may give rise to disturbances of mental function observed in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This proposal seeks to meet this need by developing PsyNeuLink: an open source, Python-based software environment that makes it easy to create new models, import and/or re-implement existing ones, integrate these within a single software environment that will facilitate head-to-head comparison of comparable models, the assembly of complementary models into system-level models, and serve as a common repository for the documentation and dissemination of such models for both research and didactic purposes (i.e., publication, education, etc.). These goals will be pursued under two Specific Aims: 1) Extend the scope of modeling efforts that PsyNeuLink can accommodate by: i) enhancing its application programmer interface (API) used to add new components and interfaces to statistical analysis tools and other modeling environments (such as PyTorch, Emergent and ACT-R; ii) enriching its Library by adding PsyNeuLink implementations of influential models of neural subsystems; and iii) developing a publicly available workbook of simulation exercises as both an introduction to PsyNeuLink and for use in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry curricula. 2) Accelerate PsyNeuLink by developing a custom compiler that preserves its simplicity and flexibility, while dramatically increasing its speed, to make it suitable for simulation of large and complex system-level models, and for parameter estimation, model fitting, and model comparison. This project will exploit the power and accelerating use of Python, and modern just-in-time compilation methods to develop a tool designed specifically for the needs of systems-level Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry. This promises to open up new opportunities for research at the systems-level — a level of analysis that is crucial both for understanding how human mental function emerges from the interplay among neural subsystems, and how disturbances of individual neural subsystems impact this interplay, disruptions of which are almost certainly a critical factor in neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. This proposed project seeks to address this need by developing a standard software platform for the construction, documentation, sharing, and integration of computational models of brain function, that promises to accelerate the study of how system-level interactions give rise to mental function and, critically, the kinds of disruptions of such system-level interactions produced by disturbances of individual subsystems — disruptions that are sure to be a complex but critical factor in neurological and psychiatric disorders.",PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry,9976610,R21MH117548,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Perceptual learning', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Writing', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'flexibility', 'head-to-head comparison', 'improved', 'learning network', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'open source', 'parallelization', 'preservation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,197545,-0.014873470050858617
"A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis Project Summary  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a robust hybrid neural-machine interface (NMI), combining brain and muscle signals, to improve overall control of a lower limb prosthetic device during activities of daily living. Limb amputation affects over 600,000 individuals annually in the US, and is a major cause of physical disability that causes activities of daily living to become difficult or impossible for the amputee. The limitations of current lower-limb prostheses are associated with limited volitional control, reduced mobility, and chronic gait abnormalities, which have been linked to exhaustion from increased energy expenditure, increased risk of falling, and degenerative bone and joint disorders in both the intact and amputated limb. In this study, EMG signals from both residual and intact lower limbs and EEG signals from the cortex are leveraged to decode transitions to and from various modes of locomotion modes in able-bodied individuals and transfemoral amputees, and to provide a global understanding of movement at the cortical, muscular, and kinematic level in amputees. Specifically, time and frequency domain features are leveraged to create a prediction algorithm capable of identifying upcoming terrain transitions in advance. In lower limb amputees, this hybrid NMI paradigm translates to volitional control of a powered lower-limb prosthesis, which allows for seamless transitions between various movement conditions. The high-level of control is expected to result in significant increases in level of activity and overall improvements in gait. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of EEG or EMG based NMIs for orthotic and prosthetic devices; however, no study to date has integrated EEG and EMG in a NMI for powered lower limb prostheses. This study is motivated by the need to explore advanced neural control sources for intuitive control of artificial limbs.  This project aligns directly with the Mission & Goals of the NIH, the Brain Initiative, and NIH’s Blueprint Program by expanding fundamental knowledge of neuroscience, human, health and wellness; by utilizing an innovative research strategy; and ultimately returning the knowledge to the public through the development of a highly advanced medical technology. Furthermore, the technology developed through this work has implications beyond the amputee population in the treatment of many neurological conditions and injuries, such as in neurorehabilitation after stroke. The innovation of this project lies in the novel approach of using multimodal neural signals and movement synergies as a framework for interpreting movement of the lower limb. The scientific impact is realized by a greater understanding of the neural correlates of movement after lower-limb amputation. The direct clinical significance for the patient can be measured directly through improved gait performance and walking confidence, leading to increased mobility and a reduced risk of falling, exhaustion, and bone and joint disorders. Project Narrative  The development of a hybrid neural-machine interface that incorporates muscle and brain signaling for communication with robotic systems is important to public health because it allows for robust volitional control of powered prostheses and exoskeletons during activities of daily living. This will directly benefit the amputee population by allowing better control of their prosthesis during locomotion, especially when navigating complex terrains, such as stairs and inclines. The implications of this technology can be used beyond the amputee population to further understand the effect of neurological injuries on the brain, and for improving rehabilitation paradigms associated with their treatment.",A Hybrid Neural-Machine Interface for Volitional Control of a Powered Lower Limb Prosthesis,10214202,K00NS105210,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bone Diseases', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Electronic Mail', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Agency', 'Future Teacher', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurosciences', 'Oral', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Ramp', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Robotics', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Surface', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'physically handicapped', 'post stroke', 'posters', 'powered exoskeleton', 'powered prosthesis', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rehabilitation paradigm', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot control', 'robot exoskeleton', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic system', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'undergraduate student', 'visual motor']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K00,2020,72598,0.0064080586900514035
"Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology Project Summary Listening in noise is a core problem in everyday hearing. Sound sources of interest routinely occur amid irrelevant distractors, as when you talk with someone in a bustling coffee shop. This background “noise” distorts the pattern of spikes in the auditory nerve, often to a profound degree. Thus, to recognize sources of interest, the auditory system must somehow separate or suppress the effects of the background. Typical human hearing is remarkably noise-robust, but listeners with age-related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments – and are not much helped by contemporary hearing aids. Previous work on the neural basis of noise robustness has typically employed simple, synthetic noise sources, which lack the structure present in real-world sounds, and this work has focused on subcortical regions or on primary auditory cortex. Reasoning that real-world conditions might necessitate more complicated solutions, in the applicant's doctoral work, he considered everyday sources of noise, and leveraged the large-scale coverage afforded by fMRI to examine noise robustness throughout human auditory cortex. Real-world “background noise” was operationalized as a natural sound with statistical properties that are stable over time (i.e., are stationary), conveying little new information about the world (e.g., swamp insects, an air conditioner, rain on pavement). The applicant measured fMRI responses in human listeners to a broad set of natural sounds presented in quiet, as well as embedded in the real-world background noises. Primary auditory cortical responses were substantially altered by the background, but non-primary responses were substantially more robust. This effect was not seen for simple synthetic backgrounds as had been used in previous work, suggesting that becoming robust to real-world background noises require different mechanisms. The applicant's thesis work demonstrates where noise invariance arises, but understanding how will require data with finer spatial and temporal resolution, and thus the proposed postdoctoral research will consist of training in single-unit electrophysiology using marmosets. Aim 1A builds on previous work examining single- unit noise robustness in artificial conditions, extending such work to real-world noise. Aim 1B leverages texture models to probe what aspects of real-world backgrounds disrupt the encoding of foregrounds. Aim 2A deploys linear reconstruction techniques to probe population representations. Aim 2B involves optimizing deep neural networks for noise invariance tasks, and using them as an encoding model to predict single-unit responses. Furthermore, such networks will be deployed as nonlinear decoding algorithms, reconstructing stimuli from neuronal populations. Throughout all aims, the work will characterize neuronal responses in non-primary areas, and in particular in parabelt, which is understudied in primates. The proposed work may enable improvements in hearing aid algorithms or neural prosthetics. Lastly, this training will lay the groundwork for the applicant's long-term goal of developing a marmoset model for hearing loss. Project Narrative Typical human hearing is remarkably robust to the presence of background noise, but listeners with age- related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments – and often do not benefit from contemporary hearing aids in these conditions. In my doctoral work, using fMRI in humans I showed that real-world background noise engages different mechanisms than the simpler synthetic noise typically employed in previous work. In my postdoctoral work I will be trained in marmoset electrophysiology to zoom in to the level of neural circuits to probe the mechanisms that generate auditory cortex's robustness to background noise.",Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology,10104430,F32DC017628,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Callithrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Coffee', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Presbycusis', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Rain', 'Research', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'sound', 'temporal measurement']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2020,64926,0.0027230396988163147
"Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex PROJECT SUMMARY Humans with normal hearing excel at deriving information about the world from sound. Our auditory abilities represent stunning computational feats that only recently have been replicated to any extent in machine systems. And yet our auditory abilities are highly vulnerable, being greatly compromised in listeners with hearing impairment, cochlear implants, and auditory neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in the presence of noise. Difficulties in recognition often lead to frustration and social isolation, and are not adequately addressed by current hearing aids, implants, and remediation strategies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to reveal the basis of auditory recognition and to provide insights that will facilitate improved prosthetic devices and therapeutic interventions. The development of more effective devices and therapies is currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the factors that underlie real-world recognition by normal-hearing listeners. In particular, although responses to sound in subcortical auditory pathways are relatively well studied, little is known about the transformations that occur within the auditory cortex to create representations of meaningful sound structure. We propose to enrich the understanding of auditory recognition with three sets of experiments that examine the cortical representation of real-world sounds in human listeners, combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling of the underlying representations. Aim 1 develops artificial neural network models of speech and music processing and compares their representations to those in the auditory cortex, synthesizing and then measuring brain responses to sounds that generate the same response in a model, and probing the time scale of the auditory analysis of speech and music. Aim 2 develops and tests models of pitch perception in noise, exploring the hypothesis that pitch perception is constrained both by the statistics of natural sounds and the frequency selectivity of the cochlea. Aim 3 develops and tests models that jointly localize and recognize sounds, and probes the brain representations of sound identity and location using fMRI. The results will reveal the mechanisms underlying robust sound recognition by the healthy auditory system and will set the stage for investigations of the cortical consequences of hearing impairment and auditory developmental disorders, hopefully suggesting new strategies for remediation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: People with normal hearing are typically able to recognize, understand and localize sounds of interest, but this ability is often compromised in listeners with hearing disorders. The proposed research will enrich the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying auditory recognition and localization in normal listeners. The results will likely provide insight into the brain processes whose alteration in hearing disorders underlies listening difficulties, potentially leading to improved remediation strategies.",Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex,9944496,R01DC017970,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Ear', 'Floor', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing Aids', 'Hearing Tests', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pitch Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Social isolation', 'Sound Localization', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Pathways', 'artificial neural network', 'auditory pathway', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'developmental disease', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'sound', 'sound frequency', 'speech processing', 'statistics']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,337875,-0.026480332888380868
"Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network The ability to learn and think about complex situations is central to a range of human cognitive functions, including navigation, reasoning, and decision making. Numerous theories across these domains rely on representations of states of these external and internal environments, but how they acquire such representations remains unknown. My overall goal is to understand how animals, including humans, can reason and learn in such complex environments. In this project, we propose to investigate how animals are able to learn these representations in a complex sequential decision making task in monkeys. Using a novel behavioral task inspired by the board game battleship, monkeys search for hidden shapes on a screen. There are millions of possible shapes, and yet monkeys are capable learners, vastly outperforming classic reinforcement learning algorithms. How monkeys can learn the shapes so quickly remains mysterious. In addition to these unknown computational foundations for learning, the neural mechanisms that support this behavior are also unexplored. Recent studies including electrophysiology and lesion research have found signatures of state representations in the amygdala (AMYG) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, these studies have only used very few states that only require associations to learn. Moreover, the interactions and computational roles of the regions have not been characterized. In light of these gaps in our understanding of learning in complex tasks, we will use the battleship task to elucidate 1) the aspects of the environment that drive learning representations of complex states, 2) the computational foundations of this learning using behavioral model fitting and deep neural networks, and 3) the neural mechanisms that underwrite this capacity in the AMYG-OFC circuit. We hypothesize that OFC represents hidden task states, those that cannot be fully defined in terms of perceptible stimuli and outcomes. We further hypothesize that AMYG plays a central role in learning and updating these representations by constructing an online representation of the current environment using input from OFC as well as from sensory processing and memory regions, representing current stimuli, outcomes, and associations. We posit an observer-critic architecture underlies learning representations of complex tasks, with AMYG activity computing and sending a teaching signal to OFC that learns and updates task state representations. As part of this planned research, I will be trained in advanced modeling and neural analysis techniques, and complete a course of study on the use of deep neural networks. This training will take place under the guidance of Dr. Stefano Fusi and Dr. C Daniel Salzman in the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. Despite broad relevance to understanding the mind, how people are able to learn and adapt to changes in their environments remains unknown.

"Investigating Ventral CA1 Neural Representations of Anxiety-Like Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to detect and appropriately respond to potentially threatening situations is critical for survival. Dysregulation of the neural systems which mediate these functions can lead to pathological avoidance of ordinary environments and persistent feelings of imminent threat, key components of the negative emotional state characteristic of anxiety disorders. Many studies have begun to reveal the brain regions and neural circuits that control avoidance behavior and encode states of anxiety. Specifically, the ventral hippocampus has emerged as a critical node for emotional behaviors including those evoked by anxiogenic environments. Our lab and others have found that subpopulations of single neurons in ventral CA1 are activated by aversive environments, but this selectivity does not generalize across different tasks used to assay anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, it is unclear which inputs to the ventral hippocampus provide the emotional information that drives this anxiety-related neural activity. The mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety states is still unknown and investigating how this brain region represents these emotional states is an essential step towards understanding the neural substrates of anxiety disorders. In this proposal, I will utilize pose estimation algorithms and unsupervised behavioral segmentation (Aim 1), in vivo calcium imaging and neural population analyses (Aim 2), along with simultaneous input-specific optogenetic inhibition and calcium imaging (Aim 3) to characterize the behavioral manifestations of anxiety-like emotional states and determine how they are encoded in the ventral hippocampus. Successful completion of this study will help to elucidate the role of the ventral hippocampus in anxiety, potentially opening new research avenues for the development of neural circuit based therapeutics to treat anxiety disorders. These data along with the research and scientific expertise developed through this Kirschstein-NRSA F30 Fellowship Award will support my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist.

"Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations Project Summary/Abstract The mammalian brain builds and transforms representations of the outside world through the concerted activity of populations of neurons, but the extent to which spike times or spike counts are coordinated within these ensembles beyond pairs is not clear. Models of neural encoding predict variable frequencies of spike pattern occurrence, and models of decoding delineate requirements for spike time precision within the population response. While considerable effort has been made toward the development and refinement of the theoretical basis of such neural coding schemes, and predictions have been tested against single cell and pairwise data, there has been relatively little experimental data beyond pairs able to differentiate between competing hypotheses of population coding. The proposed career development plan aims to marry large-scale electrophysiology in primary visual cortex with analysis of specific predictions derived from computational and theoretical neuroscience work for spike time coordination beyond pairwise interactions. The candidate has a deep background in in vivo experimental techniques and proposes to receive training in the high-dimensional computational techniques and to use experimental data collected to validate specific theoretical predictions. This training will establish the skills necessary for a successful independent research career studying the mechanisms of information representation and transfer in visual cortex, bridging the gap between experimental and computational neuroscience. The candidate will carry out the mentored phase under the guidance of Dr. Clay Reid, a world expert in multiple aspects of mammalian central visual processing including anatomy, physiology, and computation. Additional advising from Dr. Eric Shea- Brown and Dr. Christof Koch will provide guidance in the theoretical and applied mathematical approaches required to implement and assess advanced models of neural encoding and decoding. The training will utilize the strengths of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in collecting large-scale data and the didactic opportunities at the University of Washington. In the independent phase the candidate will use the newly acquired analytical and modeling skills in combination with his previous training in optogenetic techniques to better constrain population measurements. This work will help establish a unique independent research program to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cortical representation. Project Narrative Understanding how the brain uses population activity to build representations of the outside world is an important step towards understanding not only sensory but also psychiatric and other cognitive disorders. This work on the fundamental nature of the neural code will contribute to the body of knowledge required to create effective brain interfaces for motor and sensory prostheses with the potential to reduce sensory disabilities, provide treatments for cognitive disorders, and aid in recovery from central nervous system trauma.",Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations,10006552,R00EY028612,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Frequencies', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Population Statistics', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Disorders', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic CNS injury', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visual Cortex', 'Washington', 'Work', 'area striata', 'awake', 'career', 'career development', 'clay', 'computational neuroscience', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'mathematical methods', 'millisecond', 'neural model', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory prosthesis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'visual processing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2020,249000,-0.0026150654457443323
"Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data SUMMARY Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as a spike train, comes from an individual neuron. Another, the local field potential (LFP), is based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. For both kinds of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationarity. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities, but they also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. To provide the most useful information for designing novel therapies it is important to characterize the interactions among different parts of the brain, and the timing of these interactions relative to behavior. The research in this grant aims to develop methods for analyzing the ways that a network of brain areas may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior. This involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales: slower timescales can provide insight into states of the brain, such as the extent to which a subject is paying attention to a task; fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFPs) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). NARRATIVE Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statistical analysis.

"CRCNS: Real-time neural decoding for calcium imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Chen, Rong PROJECT DESCRIPTION A. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Real-time neural decoding centers on predicting behavior variables based on neural activity data, where the prediction is performed at a pace that reliably keeps up with the speed of the activity that is being monitored. Neuromodulation devices are becoming one of the most powerful tools for the treatment of brain disorders, enhancing neurocognitive performance, and demonstrating causality (Bergmann et al., 2016; Knotkova and Rasche, 2015). A precise neuromodulation system (Figure 1) integrates neural activity monitoring, real-time neural decoding, and neuromodulation. In precise neuromodulation, a decoding device predicts a behavior variable based on neural data streams in real-time. Based on the decoding results, neuromodulation parameters such as timing, frequency, duration, and amplitude are changed. Precise neuromodulation systems with closed-loop real-time feedback are superior to the fixed (open- loop) neuromodulation paradigm (Brocker et al., 2017; deBettencourt et al., 2015; Ezzyat et al., 2017). A recent direct brain stimulation study (Ezzyat et al., 2017) demonstrated significant advantages of precise neuromodulation over open-loop neuromodulation. Ezzyat et al. applied direct brain stimulation with decoding capability to patients with epilepsy to improve their memory. They found that stimulation increased memory function only if delivered when the decoding device indicated low encoding efficiency while stimulation decreased memory function if delivered when the decoding device indicated high encoding efficiency. An open-loop neuromodulation system with a fixed stimulation paradigm may not always facilitate memory function.  Miniature cellular imaging (Ghosh et al., 2011; Kerr and Nimmerjahn, 2012; Scott et al., 2013) is one of the most powerful ways to study neural circuits. It enables us to investigate neural circuits during behaviors for an understanding of network architecture of behavior, cognition, and emotion. Miniature cellular imaging records neuronal activity at cellular and sub-second levels of spatial and temporal resolution in freely moving animals. Miniature cellular imaging has many advantages. First, compared with in vivo multi-electrode recording, miniature calcium imaging can probe all cells in the field of view, and visualize the spatial location of monitored cells (Kerr et al., 2005). Second, compared with magnetic resonance imaging, which measures brain activity at the macroscopic scale and with low temporal resolution, miniature cellular imaging provides high spatial and temporal resolution. Third, fiber photometry (Cui et al., 2014) lacks cellular-level resolution, while miniature cellular imaging allows concurrent tracking of neural calcium activities at cellular spatial resolution.

"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9894854,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,381213,0.0021366945953712854
"CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations Throughout the brain, specialized systems carry out different but complementary functions, sometimes  independently but often in cooperation. However, we do not understand how their activity is dynamically  coordinated, and dysregulation of this is associated with many mental health conditions. Neuronal oscillations, which are detectable in local field potentials (LFPs) at various frequencies, are a promising  target for this coordination. Gamma oscillations (40-100 Hz) in particular have been singled out since they enhance stimulus responses, facilitate interactions between brain regions, and are expressed ubiquitously across cortical and subcortical regions. Indeed, gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral  nucleus of the amygdala (BL), an important regulator of emotional behaviors. BL gamma oscillations are  enhanced during periods of heightened vigilance during a foraging task, following emotionally salient experiences, and upon presentation of socially-relevant stimuli. The variety of circumstances that engage  it make it a promising target for interventions affecting emotional behaviors in general. However, technical challenges abound because gamma manifests as brief intermittent oscillatory bursts, layered atop numerous ongoing activities in other frequency bands. This precludes manipulating gamma exclusively with traditional pharmacological, optogenetic, or chemogenetic approaches, since these have substantial  effects on ongoing non-gamma activities, and are delivered irrespective of whether gamma bursts are present or absent. To overcome this, a closed-loop algorithm was developed that monitors the LFP in  real-time for gamma oscillations and delivers precisely timed optogenetic stimulation capable of enhancing or suppressing gamma strength on a cycle-by-cycle basis. While this improves upon the status  quo,, further refinement is needed. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to clarify how the gamma modulation technique operates via biophysically detailed modeling of the local circuits in the BL that generate gamma, the effects of optogenetic stimulation, and the closed-loop algorithm. Aim 2 designs better signal  processing routines for detecting and parameterizing gamma in real-time. Aim 3 develops an approach to  create customized biophysical models that reproduce the properties of gamma observed in individual  subjects, which when combined with the results of Aims 1 and 2 should allow for optimized control over gamma oscillations in individual subjects. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region implicated in emotional regulation.  By developing improved methods to manipulate these oscillations, we hope to better understand their  function and improve our ability to control emotional states and behaviors. n/a",CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations,10002297,R01MH122023,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Emotional', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rodent Model', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'biophysical model', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional behavior', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'vigilance']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2020,284005,-0.0052760095221160855
"Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroscience is producing increasingly complex data sets, including measures and manipulations of sub- cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular mechanisms operating over multiple timescales and in the context of different behaviors and task conditions. These data sets pose several fundamental challenges. First, for a given data set, what are the relevant spatial, temporal, and computational scales in which the underlying information-processing dynamics are best understood? Second, what are the best ways to design and select models to account for these dynamics, given the inevitably limited, noisy, and uneven spatial and temporal sampling used to collect the data? Third, what can increasingly complex data sets, collected under increasingly complex conditions, tells us about how the brain itself processes complex information? The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate new, theoretically grounded methods to help researchers to overcome these challenges. Our primary hypothesis is that resolving, modeling, and interpreting relevant information- processing dynamics from complex data sets depends critically on approaches that are built upon understanding the notion of complexity itself. A key insight driving this proposal is that definitions of complexity that come from different fields, and often with different interpretations, in fact have a common mathematical foundation. This common foundation implies that different approaches, from direct analyses of empirical data to model fitting, can extract statistical features related to computational complexity that can be compared directly to each other and interpreted in the context of ideal-observer benchmarks. Starting with this idea, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish a common theoretical foundation for analyzing both data and model complexity; 2) develop practical, complexity-based tools for data analysis and model selection; and 3) establish the usefulness of complexity-based metrics for understanding how the brain processes complex information. Together, these Aims provide new theoretical and practical tools for understanding how the brain integrates information across large temporal and spatial scales, using formal, universal definitions of complexity to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of complex neural and behavioral data sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will establish new, theoretically grounded computational tools to help neuroscience researchers design and analyze studies of brain function. These tools, which will be made widely available to the neuroscience research community, will help support a broad range of studies of the brain, enhance scientific discovery, and promote rigor and reproducibility.","Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience",10002220,R01EB026945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'complex data ', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'data tools', 'design', 'information processing', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,20957,0.004498589429478833
"Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging Project Summary. Neuroimaging is poised to take a substantial leap forward in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of human behavior, due to a combination of improved analytic techniques and the quality of imaging data. These advances are allowing researchers to develop population-level multivariate models of the functional brain representations underlying behavior, performance, clinical status and prognosis, and other outcomes. Population-based models can identify patterns of brain activity, or `signatures', that can predict behavior and decode mental states in new individuals, producing generalizable knowledge and highly reproducible maps. These signatures can capture behavior with large effect sizes, and can be used and tested across research groups. However, the potential of such signatures is limited by neuroanatomical constraints, in particular individual variation in functional brain anatomy. To circumvent this problem, current models are either applied only to individual participants, severely limiting generalizability, or force participants' data into anatomical reference spaces (atlases) that do not respect individual functional topology and boundaries. Here we seek to overcome this shortcoming by developing new topological models for inter-subject alignment, which register participants' functional brain maps to one another. This will increase effective spatial resolution, and more importantly allow us to explicitly analyze the spatial topology of functional maps make inferences on differences in activation location and shape across persons and psychological states. We will test and validate the methods using a purpose-designed experiment (n = 120) that includes two types of naturalistic narrative experiences (movies and audio stories) and tasks from three functional domains (pain, emotion, and cognition). The tasks are designed with several constraints in mind, including: (1) systematic coverage of cognitive, emotional, and sensory tasks matched in stimulus properties (e.g., stimulus duration); and (2) multiple levels of task demand within each task, to permit parametric modeling and prediction of demand levels. We will compare our new methods to existing methods based on out-of-sample effect sizes in predicting behavior and test-retest reliability. We will make the analytic methods, software, and dataset available to other researchers, along with a library of functional reference spaces for multiple psychological states. Project Narrative. We develop new methods for enhancing the development of models that can predict behavior, clinical status, and other outcomes using neuroimaging data. Successful development will help improve the translational impact of neuroimaging. It will also contribute to developing multidisciplinary neuroscience, by promoting the development of neural signatures for specific mental processes in humans with increased precision and specificity.",Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging,9908089,R01EB026549,"['Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Charon', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gaussian model', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Processes', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Wages', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'mental state', 'model development', 'movie', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'statistics', 'translational impact']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,667005,-0.007962479405987077
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled. PROJECT NARRATIVE The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques as well as automatic clustering approaches based on quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution.

"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement. Project Narrative Early in life, we must acquire crucial skills like speech by imitating adults, so neurological impairments of imitative learning can be debilitating. This proposal is relevant to human health because it will address how cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry supports juvenile imitative learning in a powerful laboratory model, song learning by zebra finches. Insight from the project's findings may improve our ability to relate CBG circuit biology to behavioral outcomes in normal and disordered juvenile imitative learning.",Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches,9911141,F31HD098772,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Punishment', 'Pupil', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'behavioral outcome', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motor learning', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'role model', 'skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'tutoring', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization', 'zebra finch']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,37429,-0.0658354631317295
"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions. The starting point of the project is our earlier discovery that phase structure in oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) of hippocampal areas CA1/CA3 carry location information in exquisite detail (Agarwal et al. 2014). We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations. The computational description level will leverage ideas of vector symbolic architectures, a class of connectionist models originally proposed for describing cognitive reasoning (Plate, 1995; Kanerva, 1996). Models produced by the software tool will concisely encapsulate assumptions about the computation and its implementation of a brain function and produce predictions that can be tested in a next generation of recording experiments. The proposed theory framework will be tested in building models for navigation in hippocampus and for visual processing in areas V1 and V4 in cortex. Project narrative: A key difficulty with inferring brain function from recordings of neural activity in a working brain is that the dynamics of individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Here we address this problem by delivering new tools for decoding and decomposing neural population activity, leveraging the recent discovery by the PI of behavior-specific phase structure of local field potentials. Further, we provide software and a theoretical framework for describing models of brain function on a computational and mechanistic level that can produce testable predictions for a new generation of brain recording experiments.",Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings,9999578,R01EB026955,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Encapsulated', 'Fostering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'area V1', 'area V4', 'base', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'independent component analysis', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'presynaptic', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'visual processing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,20198,-0.02118131522546729
"Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks The mammalian brain is believed to be optimally designed for robust and adaptable computation of the sensory inputs from the world, with respect to both its hardware (network structure) and software (network dynamics). The precise connections between the intricate structural connectivity and the rich network dynamics, however, are yet unknown. Moreover, our understanding of how the network structure and dynamics shape (or are shaped by) underlying coding principles in the brain network, is limited. My research plan proposes to close this gap by leveraging rich dataset obtained by state-of-art experimental techniques at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and innovative mathematical methods.  Specifically, my project aims to 1) link network structure and dynamic information processing in the brain, and to 2) bridge the gap between detailed biophysiological mechanisms and overarching neural coding principles with a focus on predictive coding theory, using data-driven mathematical models. To address Aim 1, I will investigate how network dynamics measured by synchronizability, metastability, and integrated information depend on local and global structure of the network. I will then study whether the experimentally obtained mouse brain connectome has optimal connectivity structures for unique dynamical characteristics. These analyses will be extended to the cell-type and layer-specific brain connectivity, based on the latest Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity data obtained from Cre-transgenic mice. During the independent phase, I will investigate whether brain-like networks can be evolved from optimization of dynamic measures. Regarding Aim 2, I will analyze data obtained from my current collaborative project which experimentally tests predictive coding models in the mouse visual cortex. In this study, we measure neural activity in response to expected and unexpected sequences of natural stimuli across three hierarchically related areas. Upon completion of the experiments, during the mentored phase, I will investigate mapping of algorithmic units in predictive coding models to neuronal populations in different layers. During my independent career period, I will extend the predictive coding model to incorporate active sensing and thalamo-cortical circuitries.  The project during the mentored phase will be carried out at the University of Washington which provides a highly interdisciplinary environment and offers the ideal training for me to become an independent researcher. I will also have access to rich resources and outstanding collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. I will have two mentors, one from the University of Washington and another from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. This unique setup will allow me to study mathematical models based on experimental data obtained by cutting-edge techniques with guidance from mentors with strong theoretical backgrounds. With theories closely tied to experiments, I believe my proposed project will contribute to our understanding of the connection between structure and computation of the neuronal network, addressing BRAIN initiative’s high priorities. The proposed research aims to probe how adaptable sensory coding arises from intricate connectivity structure and dynamics of the brain network at multiple scales. This study will contribute to our understanding of connections between unique structure and dynamics of the brain network as well as the mapping of complex neuronal dynamics in the cortical circuitry to algorithmic nodes in predictive coding models. By combining cutting-edge experimental and theoretical tools, this project will contribute to identifying fundamental principles underlying emergence of cognition and perception from neuronal network dynamics.","Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks",10000156,K99EY030840,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive control', 'collaborative environment', 'connectome', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'object recognition', 'predictive test', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'theories', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,128619,-0.01553778742565975
"RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data Project Summary/Abstract  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allows the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded. We use the term ECOG to refer to the entire range of invasive recording techniques (from subdural strips and grids to penetrating electrodes) that share the common attribute of recording neural activity from the human brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. While this ability has resulted in many high-impact advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain function in health and disease, it generates staggering amounts of data as a single patient can be implanted with hundreds of electrodes, each sampled thousands of times a second for hours or even days. The difficulty of exploring these vast datasets is the rate-limiting step in using them to improve human health. We propose to overcome this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the unique properties of ECOG. We dub this software tool RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).  The first goal of Aim 1 is to release RAVE 1.0 to the entire ECOG community by month 6 of the first funding period. This will maximize transformative impact by putting the new tools in the hands of users as quickly as possible, facilitating rapid adoption. The design philosophy of RAVE is driven by three imperatives. The first is to keep users ""close to the data"" so that users may make discoveries about the brain without being misled by artifacts. The second imperative is rigorous statistical methodology. The final imperative is ""play well with others"". As described in Aim 2, our approach will make it easy to seamlessly incorporate new and existing analysis tools written in Matlab, C++, Python or R into RAVE, giving users the best of both worlds: advanced but easy-to-use visualization of results from ECOG experiments, whether they are analyzed with the off-the- shelf tools routines provided with RAVE or novel tools developed by others.

"Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion PROJECT SUMMARY Little is known about the neural mechanisms that regulate natural dynamic cues during human social and emotional interactions, although these mechanisms are impaired in many psychiatric and neurological disorders. Although it is widely understood that social signals such as facial expressions carry salient, but implicit, emotional and social cues, these “real-time” pathways have not been investigated with dual-brain neuroimaging techniques. This unmet need is largely due to technological limitations that prevent neuroimaging of two or more individuals during natural interactive situations. We overcome this technical “roadblock” with recent advances in an emerging human brain imaging technology, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This non-invasive technique detects active neural tissue based on hemodynamic signals measured by variations in the absorption spectra associated with oxyhemoglobin and de-oxyhemoglobin. Because detectors and emitters are surface mounted on the head, absent a high magnetic field, they are relatively insensitive to head movement and thus successfully applied to dyadic experiments. The focus of this proposal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie dynamic cross-brain neural coupling during real interpersonal interactions. Cross-brain neural coupling is defined as the correlation between the temporal patterns of the signals of two brains. It has been proposed that these matched patterns represent shared neural processes including dynamic exchanges of information. However, the basic assumptions of shared information and temporal resonance patterns between specific brain-to-brain regions has not been tested. We pioneer tests of these hypothesis using eye-to-eye contact as a metric of shared information and predict that dynamic neural coupling between the two brains will increase with increasing numbers of eye-to-eye contact events. Mimicry of facial expressions is also a metric of emotional contagion as well as shared information between brains. We further test the hypothesis that neural coupling will increase with the level of mimicry also by virtue of the shared information Confirmation of the hypothesis that neural coupling represents shared information between the two brains would provide a singular advance for understanding mechanisms for dynamic interactions. Both approaches include variations of emotive expressions to test the additional hypothesis that content as well as shared information might influence dynamic coupling mechanisms. Findings from these studies are expected to open a new direction for the study of live and dynamic interactions between individuals, and provide foundational components to a general framework for models of face-to-face interactions. A long-term goal is to understand the neural underpinnings of affective disorders as they present in clinically-relevant and real-world situations. Project Narrative How do two brains interact? We pioneer a novel neuroimaging technology, near infrared spectroscopy, to investigate basic mechanisms of neural coupling between two dynamically interacting individuals. Using these new methods we test the fundamental hypothesis that neural coupling (temporal synchrony between two brains) represents shared information across the two brains.",Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion,9883842,R01MH119430,"['Affective', 'Arousal', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Eyebrow structure', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Negative Valence', 'Oral cavity', 'Oxyhemoglobin', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smiling', 'Social Interaction', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'contagion', 'detector', 'dyadic interaction', 'emotional reaction', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'magnetic field', 'mimicry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,400249,0.00024513082992808977
"Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method of focally stimulating the brain that uses electromagnetic induction and does not require surgery. There is optimism that TMS will revolutionize how we treat neurological and psychiatric disorders, evidenced by over 1000 clinical trials registered using TMS. Much of this optimism stems from the successful use of TMS as a treatment for depression. Despite the large number of clinical trials using TMS the number of therapeutic indications has been stagnant, limited to major depression and more recently obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are fundamental questions about the underlying mechanisms of action for TMS that will be critical to understand in order to advance this treatment modality. Here, we propose a unique collaborative project between neurology and neurosurgery that will allow an unprecedented window into understanding how TMS impacts the human brain. Specifically, we will perform TMS in neurosurgical patients with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) monitoring to record real time effects of TMS on local and remote brain areas with an unparalleled combination of spatial and temporal resolution relative to other human studies. We have already demonstrated the safety of this approach using a gel-based phantom brain and have results from seven patients demonstrating safety and preliminary results. For the current proposal we aim to: 1) characterize the response of TMS on the human brain as recorded from iEEG between active and sham conditions, and 2) relate remote electrophysiological responses induced by TMS to measures of brain connectivity between the stimulation and recording sites assessed with resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI). This will allow us to evaluate the relationship between TMS-evoked iEEG responses and the strength of functional connectivity to the stimulation site in a regression model. We hypothesize that: 1) TMS will have focal effects detected from surface electrodes underlying the stimulation site as well as network-level engagement detected at remote sites, 2) Repetitive TMS will induce frequency- specific effects that differ between 0.5 and 10 Hz stimulation protocols, and 3) the magnitude of repetitive TMS-evoked iEEG responses across electrodes will relate to the strength of rs-fcMRI between the stimulation and recording sites. By investigating the electrophysiological responses of TMS with high spatiotemporal precision in humans, this study will provide new mechanistic insights into the effects of TMS on target engagement and relate these findings to imaging methods already in widespread use. Moreover, the TMS will be applied in a clinically meaningful way by targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a protocol used to treat depression. Generating results for these aims will be key to advancing our understanding of how TMS engages brain networks, which can be leveraged to rationally develop personalized, imaging-guided therapeutic TMS for depression and other disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will help our understanding of how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) affects the brain. We will develop a new method of measuring TMS-induced changes in brain activity with high spatial and temporal accuracy that is only possible with intracranial recording. The research will shed light on the mechanism of TMS and facilitate the development of better interventions and treatments for psychiatric diseases.",Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans,9971584,R21MH120441,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurology', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cranium', 'field study', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optimism', 'programs', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'stem', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2020,193125,0.013906905950841337
"Robust biomimetic models of human legs to solve high-dimensional real-time control problems Project Summary  Anatomically validated musculoskeletal models of human limbs computed faster than real-time are tools that will help advance the control of neuroprosthetics, rehabilitation, and the study of motor control principles. However, the current state-of-the-art models cannot be both accurate and fast. We propose to develop a new generation of validated real-time human leg models with musculoskeletal dynamics that are robust over the full range of multidimensional motion. The first aim is to validate a lower-limb model in the full range of static postures. The second aim is to validate a lower-limb model during dynamic locomotor tasks.  Building on our previous work, we will use OpenSim model repository as a starting point for the iterative process of validating the muscle anatomy and function using published anatomical data. We expect to recreate the full range of leg postures with the validated model. We will then collect data during locomotor tasks performed by healthy humans on the split-belt treadmill with simultaneous re- cordings of ground reaction forces, full-body motion capture, and surface electromyography from rep- resentative leg muscles. The model will be validated over a rich experimental dataset for locomotor pat- terns required in asymmetric stepping on a self-paced treadmill. We expect to validate the dynamic model by estimating in real-time the observed full body kinematics from muscle activity and ground reaction forces. The inverse solutions will allow us to estimate the ongoing spatiotemporal patterns of muscle activity.  At the conclusion of this study we will develop the detailed lower-limb model with high-di- mensional robust muscle path simulations to predict limb motion in real-time. The outcomes of this proposal will inform future work on the use of the real-time musculoskeletal models for the develop- ment of augmentation devices and the clinical assessment of locomotor deficits. Project Narrative The significance of this project is that it will address the major challenges in achieving intuitive human-computer interactions by allowing the simulation of high-dimensional muscle dynamics in real-time. The main innovation of this proposal is the rigorous validation of human leg model across large anthropomorphic variations (due to age and sex) and the robust performance using novel method for musculoskeletal simulations.",Robust biomimetic models of human legs to solve high-dimensional real-time control problems,9979392,R03HD099426,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biomimetics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electromyography', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Failure', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Neuromechanics', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical therapy', 'Polynomial Models', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'computer human interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'locomotor deficit', 'locomotor tasks', 'model development', 'motor control', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'real time model', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'sex', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'treadmill']",NICHD,WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,76000,-0.021360496263129677
"Advancing understanding of neural representations of threat perception through a novel predictive coding framework PROJECT SUMMARY Anxiety disorders affect an estimated 6.7% to 7.3% of people globally each year and incur a large burden on people’s lives. To address this urgent problem, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of the neural bases of subjective experiences in anxiety, including threat perception. Translational neuroscience has focused on animal models of defensive behavior involving a core set of regions. Although these animal models and the human subjects research they inspired have led to advances in treatment of anxiety, the mapping between neural mechanisms and subjective experience remains poorly understood. The set of regions found to support defensive behavior in animal models does not appear to be involved in all instances of fear or anxiety. The current project overcomes this barrier by integrating current models of anxiety with predictive coding models of the mind and brain. Incorporating predictive coding into models of anxiety will offer a better understanding of how neural activity relates to subjective experiences important to anxiety (e.g., threat perception). The project tests two parallel hypotheses about neural representation of threat perception suggested by predictive coding models: that neural representations of threat perception are content-specific (Aim 1) and that neural representations of threat perception depend on expectations (Aim 2). Using a single design, we manipulate content-specificity and expectations to test these two hypotheses in parallel. We use fMRI to measure brain activity and use self-report and peripheral psychophysiology to measure subjective experiences of threat perception. To the extent that participants find stimuli threatening (as indexed by self-report and psychophysiology), we hypothesize that we will observe relatively content-specific neural representations of threat. We also hypothesize that neural representations of threat will differ under conditions of expectation vs. expectancy violation. The effect of expectation may impact content-specific neural activity or activity in a core set of regions. The knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential improve understanding of the mapping between neural activity and subjective experiences. Relevant for translational neuroscience, a better understanding of the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety will be critical to closing the gap between laboratory research and more effective treatments for anxiety. More broadly, predictive coding models are models of basic brain function. Thus, the predictive coding model we propose offers a new theoretical framework that is generalizable to psychiatric illnesses involving disordered threat perception (e.g., schizophrenia) and other affective disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder). PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent work suggests that the effectiveness of treatments for anxiety has been over-estimated10-13 and development of new treatments have stalled5-8, in part, because the mapping between neural activity and subjective experiences that produce anxiety (e.g., perceiving threats) remains poorly understood. The proposed project addresses this gap in knowledge by examining the neural basis of a subjective experience important anxiety and anxiety disorders (threat perception) using a model of brain function from cognitive neuroscience. In doing so, the proposed project offers a novel theoretical framework that allows for better modeling of the relationship between neural activity and subjective experiences (e.g., threat perception) in anxiety, which has the potential to advance understanding of the mechanisms that drive anxiety and anxiety disorders.",Advancing understanding of neural representations of threat perception through a novel predictive coding framework,10068854,F32MH122062,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human Subject Research', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placebo Effect', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'anxiety treatment', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'neural model', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pain processing', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'training project', 'translational neuroscience']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,64926,0.007666415834248351
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9932509,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual environment', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,615717,0.020963974872952734
"Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients Multiple studies have shown that some patients who remain behaviorally unresponsive after severe brain damage can modulate their brain activity in response to command. A lack of response to the command- following paradigm in other patients, however, cannot be taken as evidence that consciousness is absent. There is thus an urgent need for neuroimaging tools that are able to diagnose covert consciousness in behaviorally unresponsive subjects without relying on a task. Previous neuroimaging studies of the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) have mostly utilized between-state paradigms (e.g., wakefulness vs. sleep) or report-based contrasts, which conflate differences in brain activity supporting consciousness with differences in brain activity supporting behavior or task response. To address these limitations, my sponsor (Dr. Giulio Tononi) has developed a within-state, no-report paradigm that uses serial awakenings to contrast states of consciousness versus unconsciousness during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. Using high density electroencephalography (EEG), his group has shown that the occurrence of dreaming consciousness during sleep is associated with a reduction of delta activity (sleep slow waves) in a posterior cortical ‘hot zone’ encompassing occipital, parietal and temporal cortices. To proceed towards clinical applications, it is now essential to confirm and extend these findings using combined EEG-fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). To this effect, in an important new development, Dr. Tononi and collaborators have recently shown that it is possible to faithfully track EEG slow wave activity during sleep by means of a high-frequency (~0.17 Hz) blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) oscillation evident in fMRI. This finding provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the NCCs during sleep with high spatial resolution, avoiding potential pitfalls of EEG source modeling, and with unrestricted access to subcortical structures. Taking advantage of these new findings, in this project, I propose to combine the novel fMRI signature of sleep slow waves with a serial awakenings paradigm to locate the NCCs during sleep. Specifically, I will acquire fMRI-EEG data during ~1,080 awakenings from sleep across 40 healthy subjects and investigate the neural correlates of the presence versus absence of dreaming consciousness (Aim 1). I hypothesize that high-frequency BOLD oscillation—which tracks sleep slow-waves—will show regional decreases in specific posterior cortical areas during dreaming compared to dreamless sleep. In Aim 2, I will use univariate and multivariate modeling approaches based on high-frequency BOLD power and conventional BOLD amplitude to identify the NCCs of specific dream contents (e.g., presence of faces) and complexity. If successful, the proposed experiments will constitute an important step forward in identifying brain regions that sustain consciousness and its contents during behaviorally unresponsive states. These results can open new avenues to improve clinical care in patients with a DOC and inform the assessment of intraoperative awareness in anesthetized subjects. Due to previous methodological oversights that confounded consciousness and behavior, the neural substrates of covert consciousness in unresponsive states are poorly understood. The current project will use serial awakenings with dream reports combined with a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signature of sleep slow waves to identify the neural correlates of both the presence of consciousness and its contents during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. The goal is to help clarify a scientific controversy surrounding the neural basis of consciousness at an unprecedented spatial resolution and with an access to subcortical structures, which could ultimately to improve diagnosis through neuroimaging and clinical care for patients with disorders of consciousness.",Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients,10053237,F32NS114034,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Board Certification', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Consciousness Disorders', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dreams', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Occipital lobe', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Training', 'Traumatic injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vegetative States', 'Wakefulness', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain research', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cognitive control', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'life-sustaining therapy', 'machine learning method', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'stimulus processing', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2020,67626,-0.01552606965264325
"Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks We propose to develop an implantable brain stimulation system to measure and control oscillatory local field potential (LFP) synchrony within brain networks. Implantable neurotechnologies like deep brain stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders and epilepsy. DBS has some clinical signal in psychiatry as well, but individual trial results are highly variable. We have argued that this is a target engagement problem – that the high-frequency constant stimulation used in Parkinson’s or other tremor disorders is not the right approach to the circuits of mental illness. Instead, we believe the correct approach is to identify signatures of healthy communication in these circuits/networks, then design stimulation protocols that specifically produce those signatures. LFP synchrony is likely one of those communication signatures. Across multiple domains of cognitive and emotional function, behavioral performance (a read-out of successful network communication) improves when brain regions show synchronous (coherent) LFP oscillations. Further, clinically effective DBS, in movement and psychiatric disorders, is associated with changes in LFP synchrony. Co-PI Widge has developed algorithms that specifically control inter-regional LFP synchrony, by locking electrical stimulation pulses in one region to the phase of an ongoing oscillation in another region. The translational challenge is that efficient, implantable real-time synchrony monitoring and phase-locked stimulation require signal processing capabilities not found in any existing or anticipated device. Co-PI Shoaran has developed power-efficient phase estimation circuits, specifically optimized for DBS- like implants. We propose to combine these approaches. Aims 1 and 2 will develop a new application- specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that integrates Dr. Shoaran’s measurement and neural decoding frameworks with Dr. Widge’s oscillation-control methods. We will validate this circuit’s recording and phase-locking capabilities in vivo in Dr. Widge’s rodent lab. In Aim 3, a world-leading contract implant manufacturer (Cirtec) will integrate that new ASIC into a packaged, implant-ready device ready for large animal safety testing. Cirtec has already developed a DBS prototyping platform optimized to get new therapies more quickly into first-in- human, allowing us to greatly accelerate the path to the clinic and reduce regulatory risk. At the end of 5 years, we will either be ready for that clinical pilot or have only modest safety testing remaining. Our team has expertise in electronics, medical device fabrication, clinical brain stimulation, and technology commercialization. The work will be headquartered in Minnesota’s “Medical Alley”, an epicenter of medical device innovation. We are well-qualified to execute these Aims and bring the resulting technology to market. Success would yield a new implant optimized for network monitoring and therapy, a powerful new tool for both psychiatric treatment and cutting-edge neuroscience research. Project Narrative We will develop a new implantable medical device for treating severe psychiatric illness, especially mood and anxiety disorders. Many, if not all, of these disorders arise from communication failure in distributed brain networks, networks that communicate through rhythmic, oscillatory firing of large groups of brain cells. Our device will implement new algorithms that measure and control that rhythmic firing, restoring patterns of healthy communication.",Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks,10034533,R01MH123634,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Testing', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electronics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufactured form', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tremor', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analog', 'animal safety', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain dysfunction', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'commercialization', 'conditioning', 'design', 'digital', 'emotional functioning', 'first-in-human', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'nanofabrication', 'neural circuit', 'neurotechnology', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychiatric symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'safety testing', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trigonometry']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,885873,-0.018763838280500593
"The Patricia Levy Zusman International Workshop on Neuroregeneration at Houston Methodist Project Summary/Abstract This R13 was conceived through discussions with investigators in the fields of neurostimulation and neuroplasticity at the Houston Methodist Research Institute (HMRI). In 2017, we held an R13-funded pilot workshop that combined research in neural stimulation with new insight into the molecular understanding of neural plasticity and regeneration. The results of said workshop indicated a strongly positive response by participants and interest in further catalysts of working collaboration. Thus, in 2019 we introduced new ways to increase relationship development and crossover opportunities among attendees, one of which was a blitz session wherein newly formed (i.e., established at the 2019 Workshop) collaborative teams competed for two $5K mini grants that supported travel to and from each other’s institutions. Given the overwhelmingly positive feedback, this will continue. On March 3rd-6th 2021, we will host the third Patricia Levy Zusman International Workshop on Neuroregeneration (Zusman Workshop) with a focus on the intersection of electrical activity, brain connectomics and molecular neural plasticity. Our specific aims are to: 1) formulate new ideas to fill the gap between physiology and functional-based brain stimulation technologies and the molecular and cellular understanding of innate neuronal plasticity; 2) integrate promising trainees into plenary sessions; and 3) ensure trainees participate in substantial discussions and interactions with faculty members. As in previous workshops, the 2021 Workshop will be held at HMRI. HMRI is part of the Texas Medical Center (TMC), a one-of-its-kind medical and research hub that fosters cross-institutional collaboration, creativity, and innovation located in one of the United States’ most diverse cities: Houston Texas. A key aspect of the Zusman Workshop is the active inclusion and participation of trainees, particularly women and under-represented minorities. We will encourage their participation through travel scholarships and via active promotion and recruitment throughout the TMC. Also, the Workshop seeks to promote the voices of graduate and postdoctoral trainees. As such, the 2021 Workshop will include several trainee poster sessions as well as a session dedicated to trainee presentations (given by travel awardees). Further, goal-oriented breakout sessions led by senior/early-stage investigators and selected trainees will foster discussion and promote cross-trainingand collaborationamong participants. Overall, the format of this workshop is distinct from established physiology conferences and dedicated neural regeneration conferences in several ways. It is: 1) highly focused on the gap between molecular regeneration and electrophysiology/stimulation, 2) concept driven by clinicians and experimentalists currently problem solving in human therapy, and 3) focused on the establishment of cross training and expertise development in graduate, post-graduate, and clinical fellows. We believe the 2021 Zusman Workshop will ignite collaborative networks between investigators and produce novel collaborative teams that will develop innovative, transdisciplinary methods, technologies, and treatments to modulate performance in the damaged nervous system. Project Narrative A large gap exists between researchers who seek to develop methods of neural plasticity and long-distance regeneration and experts who study the outcomes and safety of brain computer interfaces. Therefore, in 2017, we developed and held the first biannual Patricia Levy Zusman International Workshop on Neuroregeneration, which focused on the intersection of electrical activity, brain connectomics, and molecular neural plasticity. In 2021, our goals are to 1) build upon the success of our previous two workshops by inviting back and sponsoring travel for rising star alumni to return and participate; 2) create an interdisciplinary discussion of the gap in these disciplines, and 3) stimulate working groups, training opportunities, and translational approaches to speed progress in directed, stimulation-based regenerative therapies.",The Patricia Levy Zusman International Workshop on Neuroregeneration at Houston Methodist,10070437,R13NS118763,"['Acceleration', 'Adjuvant', 'Animal Model', 'Axon', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Creativeness', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Institution', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Research', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodist Church', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Movement Disorders', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome Study', 'Paralysed', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Problem Solving', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Study Section', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'catalyst', 'cellular engineering', 'clinical application', 'college', 'combinatorial', 'graduate student', 'gulf coast', 'human model', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'member', 'neural stimulation', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'posters', 'recruit', 'regenerative therapy', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'symposium', 'training opportunity', 'translational approach', 'working group']",NINDS,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R13,2020,20000,0.004316425558218222
"NSC Function in a Motor Cortex TBI Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in children with 37,200 children suffering a severe TBI with most dying or experiencing “unfavorable outcomes” within 6 months. Neural stem cells (NSCs) have been seen as a potential therapeutic option for severe pediatric TBI with the ability to differentiate and integrate into TBI brain tissue and replace damaged and lost neural networks. Many of these studies have demonstrated that NSC therapy leads to significant improvements in motor function, learning and memory in rodent models. However, no study to date has closely examined the potential of NSC to undergo region specific differentiation in a discreate injured brain region and correlated it with a measurable change in brain network activity and functional recovery. In this application, we propose to fill this knowledge gap by examining in-depth the effect of transplanted NSC differentiation and engraftment into the damaged primary motor cortex on improving brain motor network activity and motor function in a pediatric piglet model. We hypothesize that induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived NSCs (iNSCs) transplanted into the damaged primary motor cortex will undergo region specific neural differentiation leading to brain motor network and motor function recovery in a pediatric piglet TBI model. The contribution of this work is highly significant and innovative since successful completion of this project will directly lead to new insights into the ability of transplanted iNSC to undergo regionalized specific differentiation and integration, and rigorously and quantitatively assess functional recovery at the brain and whole animal level. This critical information will advance TBI cell therapy with broad implications in the neural injury, cell therapy, and tissue engineering fields at large. Testing in a translational pig model is critical due to key similarities in brain anatomy and physiology relative to rodents; thus, making findings in the pig more predictive of what would occur in human patients. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in children with 37,200 children suffering a severe TBI with most dying or experiencing “unfavorable outcomes” within 6 months. In this proposal we study the potential of induced pluripotent stem cell derived neural stem cells as a novel regenerative cell therapy for stroke in a translational pig stroke model. These findings, in addition to future studies, are expected to lead to a regenerative cell therapy that can help improve the long-term quality of life for TBI patients.",NSC Function in a Motor Cortex TBI,10089946,R21NS119167,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cell physiology', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Development', 'Engraftment', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery of Function', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'SOX1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Tubulin', 'Weight', 'Work', 'association cortex', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motor deficit', 'motor function recovery', 'myelination', 'nerve injury', 'nerve stem cell', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'novel', 'pediatric traumatic brain injury', 'regenerative', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell fate', 'stem cell therapy', 'stroke model', 'stroke therapy', 'synaptogenesis', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R21,2020,390500,-0.022925450262303772
