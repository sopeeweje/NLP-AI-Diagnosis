"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia,9739933,R01MH117172,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disorientation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Psychology', 'Source', 'Stigmatization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital media', 'digital models', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first episode schizophrenia', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'medical complication', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'stem', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'volunteer', 'willingness', 'young adult']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,682250,0.23301017612557146
"HIV Prevention and Care Project Summary I propose to implement an innovative mixed methods study using machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling in combination with advanced social network analysis to provide valuable information about the online communicative and social contexts that contribute to HIV prevention and care engagement among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The study aims to answer the following questions: (1) How are the semantic features of social media communication (i.e., key terms and concepts) among YBMSM related to their HIV prevention and care engagement?; (2) How are structural features of observed social media relationships among YBMSM related to their prevention and care engagement?; and (3) Can social media use patterns predict future prevention and care engagement? To pursue these questions, I will draw on data collected March 2016-March 2019 from YBMSM participants in an ongoing network HIV prevention intervention (N=423). Prevention and care engagement behaviors include retention in care (HIV/PrEP/Primary), STI/HIV testing, and condom use. Participant social media data include: (1) Facebook posts, (2) Facebook friendships, and (3) Facebook group memberships. K99 Phase: Research conducted during the K99 Phase will use machine learning techniques for textual analysis, semantic network characterization, and regression models to identify the semantic features of participants' communication and their association with HIV prevention and care engagement. I will receive mentored training in 5 key areas: (1) knowledge of issues relevant to HIV prevention, care and treatment for MSM; (2) machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling; (3) advanced stochastic network modeling, including exponential random graph models (ERGMs); and (4) design and implementation of social media based interventions for health promotion; and (5) professional development. R00 Phase: For the R00 I will employ one-mode and two- mode ERGMs to determine how prevention and care engagement behaviors affect the structure of observed social media relationships. I will then develop a predictive model for prevention and care engagement on the basis of individuals' social media use patterns. This K99/R00 award mechanism will be critical to my success in achieving long-term success as an expert in the social and communicative dynamics of HIV prevention and care engagement in high-risk populations. It will also pave the way to an R01 application – based on a longitudinal design – of YMSMs' social and communication engagement in a more diverse array of online social networking sites, including both general purpose and dating platforms. The goal of this project will be to utilize that information to establish classes of YMSM on the basis of their heterogeneous patterns of social media use to better understand their synergistic effects on HIV prevention and care engagement practices over time. This is an important next step in understanding how online social environments impact prevention engagement and will help identify causal relationships that may be amenable to network intervention. Project Narrative This proposal is an innovative mix methods design that utilizes machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling in combination with advanced social network analysis to provide valuable information about the online communicative and social contexts that contribute to HIV prevention and care engagement among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The proposed research will sharpen our understanding of the degree to which online social environments support protective or risky behavioral norms and, consequently the degree to which they reveal viable points for intervention. It will also demonstrate how social media data can help front-line staff profile clients in near real-time and predict future HIV-related outcomes like retention failure, thereby serving as an indicator to guide decisions on screening, treatment, and other service provisions.",HIV Prevention and Care,9774271,K99HD094648,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Facebook', 'Failure', 'Friends', 'Friendships', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Group Affiliation', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'HIV/STD', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterosexuals', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Service provision', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Site', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Network', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'black men who have sex with men', 'cohort', 'condoms', 'design', 'digital', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal design', 'meetings', 'men who have sex with men', 'network models', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer networks', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'predictive modeling', 'protective behavior', 'response', 'screening', 'sexual health intervention', 'social', 'social communication', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'socialization behavior', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'willingness', 'young adult', 'young men who have sex with men']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K99,2019,94578,0.19202059313035075
"Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention Project Summary Clinical or subclinical eating disorders (EDs) impact 10% of individuals in their lifetime and are marked by significant functional impairment, early mortality, chronicity, and emotional distress. ED symptoms often emerge in adolescence, with peak onset age in the teenage years. Early recognition and treatment of these devastating illnesses are needed to prevent long-term consequences and a chronic course. Most (80%) individuals with EDs, including teens with EDs (TwEDs), do not receive treatment. Due to major barriers to access and to the delivery of treatment for TwEDs, there is a need for a new model of service delivery that can identify and help TwEDs. We have studied ED-related networking on social media and have demonstrated our ability to harness social media, which is used ubiquitously among teens, to identify and efficiently recruit large numbers of TwEDs. At the same time, our team has successfully developed a guided self-help cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app, StudentBodies-Eating Disorders (SB-ED), which includes personalized coaching and interactive sessions to address key ED treatment targets and has demonstrated efficacy among college women with EDs. This tool has great potential to be adapted to address the specific needs of TwEDs. In Aim #1 of the proposed study, we will update and adapt SB-ED to create #ByeED for TwEDs by 1) simplifying language and making content relevant to adolescent issues, 2) including a rewards feature to motivate continued app use, 3) including a within-app social networking feature to facilitate group exchanges and coach-led weekly group sessions, and 4) harnessing machine learning to digest users’ social networking data within #ByeED to respond to potential recovery setbacks in real-time and tailor coaching interactions. Following a small focus group of TwEDs to assess initial impressions of the app, #ByeED will be piloted among 20 TwEDs recruited from Instagram, garnering feedback via a mixed methods approach on the efficiency, technical effectiveness, and satisfaction with #ByeED. The app will be further refined for a small pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Aim #2, where we will again leverage Instagram for recruitment of TwEDs who are not engaged in treatment. This RCT will approximate the preliminary effectiveness of #ByeED (n=50) versus a control group (encouraging in-person treatment in their communities, n=50) in reducing ED symptoms, improving quality of life, increasing uptake of care, and impacting targets that are associated with outcomes. We will explore within-app predictors of outcomes, potential moderators of treatment effects (e.g., psychiatric comorbidity), and participant perspectives on potential additional parental involvement in #ByeED. Effect size and attrition estimates will aid in the planning of a larger RCT (R01 mechanism) where we will further expand #ByeED (e.g., automated coaching, parental involvement) and test the app on a larger scale to improve its potential to reduce the extraordinary burden of EDs among teens. Relevance to Public Health Eating disorders often emerge in adolescence and most of these teens do not receive treatment. We will use social media to reach teens networking about eating disorder behaviors and test a mobile app specifically developed for teens, including a social networking component, to help reduce eating disorder symptoms and improve their quality of life. We will also obtain teen perspectives on acceptable approaches to include parents in this intervention to inform a future version of the app.",Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention,9719997,R34MH119170,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Anxiety', 'Body Image', 'Body Weight', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Consent', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Eating Disorders', 'Effectiveness', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Service delivery model', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavior test', 'college', 'cost', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'emotional distress', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'outreach', 'parental involvement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'restraint', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'self help', 'service delivery', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'uptake']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R34,2019,244552,0.13145320641061142
"Mining Social Media Messages for HIV Testing and Prevention Communication PROJECT SUMMARY With the advent of Big Data methods, social media is the proverbial low-hanging fruit to disseminate HIV prevention and testing messages on a large scale 1,2. These media already transmit messages on condom use, HIV testing, and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), from government institutions, NGOs, private citizens, and community groups, but it does so in an informal way. This real-time repository of real-world health messages, along with our ability to mine and pinpoint counties that need to engage in a conversation about HIV prevention and testing, offers a unique opportunity to develop Big Data methods for geographically targeted message dissemination. Despite some interventions designed for online delivery 3–19, the overall potential of social media and their most promising contents (e.g., actionable messages with behavioral instructions) have surprisingly not been established to date. Our project will focus on the disease-burdened population of Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM), and will develop a highly significant computing infrastructure (Aim 1) to automatically and continuously input social media postings from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, behavioral data from the American Men Internet Survey (AMIS), and HIV prevalence data from AIDSVu.org, and using that triangulation, to target counties that need social media messages about condom use, HIV testing, and/or PrEP for MSM. Using machine learning methods, the same platform will then select actionable and acceptable messages to fill county gaps. Once the platform has been refined with input from research participants who are employees of health departments, it will be used to send experimental messages (Aim 2), selected to match county needs, and to be actionable and acceptable to a group of health departments randomized to the experimental condition. The success of the experimental messages will be gauged by the hallmarks of social media, repostings, Likes, Dislike, and comment favorability, compared with the success of a random selection of HIV-relevant messages sent to a different group of health departments randomized to the control condition. The project is innovative in several ways. First, the social media messages will involve diverse inputs (text, images, videos) never before brought together in this area. Second, we are not aware of the prior use of the proposed triangulation involving epidemiological, behavioral, and social media data. Third, a method of mining naturally accruing messages will be new and transformative, allowing for the generation of “live” campaigns with messages selected that remain current, sustainable, and community-based by design. Further, the use of an implementation-science experiment at a large, geographically distributed, scale is highly novel. These research aims are facilitated by unique team expertise about communication and persuasion, Big Data methods, public health, and Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling, and leading institutions in the areas of psychology, public health, and computer science. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is concerned with identifying a method to disseminate public health information through social media in an optimal way.

"Utilizing Twitter to Identify and Recruit Young Black Men at High Risk of HIV Infection Project Summary  The disproportionate incidence of HIV/AIDS among Black men underscores a dire need for technologically innovative and culturally-responsive approaches to reduce HIV in Black communities. There is evidence that social media platforms such as Twitter may offer an unprecedented opportunity to identify and recruit young Black men (YBM) at elevated risk, but to date there is a dearth of empirical evidence to support that social media based-recruitment using natural language processing is feasible and/or acceptable. On social media platforms like Twitter, young men share substance and sex related content. We propose mining these Twitter posts to identify YBM who may be at risk of elevated HIV, based on their substance and sexual risk posts. This study will serve as a proof of method to test the extent to which we can identify and recruit YBM based on their social media posts. We will extend and calibrate our “High-Risk Language” (HRL) algorithm to identify users who post HIV-risk related language on Twitter. Those who agree to participate and deemed eligible will complete a qualitative interview and in- person study visit which includes HIV testing, multi-drug screening, and a survey of their sexual risk and substance use behaviors. Our primary outcomes are; (1) condomless (and/or without PrEP) vaginal or anal sex and (2) illicit drug use before or during sex. We will assess the yield and accuracy of our HRL algorithm at identifying YBM at risk, compared to their biomarkers and surveys. This work will test cutting-edge research tools aimed at increasing the rigor and precision of online recruitment efforts to reduce HIV in the Black community. Project Narrative HIV prevention and care strategies require a synergistic approach to fight HIV in the Black community.

"Social Media Mining for Pharmacovigilance Project Summary Drugs undergo extensive testing in animals and clinical trials in humans before they are marketed for widespread use. Pre-market testing produces reasonably high quality information about the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the condition for which it was approved, but gives a very incomplete picture of the drug's safety. It is only after a drug is marketed and used on a more widespread basis over longer periods of time that it is possible to identify other effects, such as rare but serious adverse effects, or those that are more common in the special subgroups excluded from the trial (such as pregnant women), or effects of long-term use of the drug, among others. Despite the increase in research in the past years exploring social media data for pharmacovigilance, and the evidence that it indeed can bring forward the patient perspective, there is no systematic approach to collect and annotate such data for research purposes. This renewal builds on our prior research and natural language processing (NLP) methods for social media mining in pharmacovigilance to make the collection of social media data about medication use precise and systematic enough to be useful to researchers and the public, alongside established sources such as the FDA's data and other public collections of drug adverse event data. It presents innovative methods to automatically collect and analyze longitudinal health data, piloting methods for interventions through the same media that can inform the public and help validate the automatic methods. As validation, we include a comparison to an existing reference standard for adverse effects that integrates FDA's data and HER data, as well as specific case studies focused on (Aim 3.1) the use of NSAIDs and anti-depressants in pregnancy and (Aim 3.2) factors for non-adherence.

"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers.

"Supplementing Survey-Based Analyses of Group Vaccination Narratives and Behaviors Using Social Media DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High quality, real-time data is essential in public health crises. Yet, traditional survey methods that rely on random-digit-dialing are expensive, difficult to deploy instantly, and fail to sample hard-to-reach populations without landline telephones, such as young adults (18-30) and minorities. In contrast, these groups heavily use social media. Twitter, in particular, is widely available and immediate, providing a rich data source that can be used to pilot hypotheses at minimal cost. These hypotheses can then be modified prior to a more in-depth study. Social media data pose challenges for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data. We will therefore develop and test an innovative computational tool that overcomes these challenges. This tool will supplement traditional survey techniques by facilitating real-time data gathering and rigorous quantitative analysis of social media data related to health narratives, attitudes, and behaviors. We will validate our tool by comparing existing survey data to social media data about influenza vaccination among adults 18-30, adult African Americans, and non-White Hispanics of all ages - three demographic categories with the highest rates of social media use, lower rates of participation in survey research, and lowest rates of seasonal flu vaccination. Thus, our tool will enable theory building. We will test hypotheses derived from the health communication literature, especially regarding how group attitudes form and change, categorize attitudes and collective narratives by existing theories and conceptual models, and build new theory to capture emerging and previously unidentified concepts. Finally, we disseminate our results and novel techniques using a website, vaccinetrends.org, that provides processed social media data to the research community. Our approach offers inexpensive, immediate access to the attitudes of these groups, transcending traditional constraints of time, money, and data access. Our approach is novel because it combines the strengths of social media analysis with those of validated survey techniques. We will draw upon two complementary population samples, representing different timescales and demographics, in order to test hypotheses in a manner that is rapid yet rigorous. In addition, our social media analysis will draw upon novel techniques to infer demographic information and social group membership, enabling the extraction of master narratives - attitudes and content that are associated with rationales for vaccine refusal and, ultimately, behavior. In addition, we will develop tools and techniques that can be adopted by researchers throughout the social, computer, and health sciences. Finally, we draw upon a much more extensive data source than has been found in previous work, including billions of Twitter messages and public forum information that will enable in-depth automated content analysis of vaccine refusal rationales. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses challenges that social media data pose for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data.

"Mighty Girls and the Mighty Moment App:  Leveraging Innovative Technology, Narrative Theory, and Social Media to Empower Young Girls to Resist Peer Pressure to Engage in Risky Behavior The goal of this SBIR Phase I is to prevent risky sexual behaviors among young female adolescents in order to reduce negative outcomes such as early pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. To accomplish this goal, we propose using state-of-the-art technology to develop a scalable and multicultural version of the efficacious Mighty Girls program and evaluate its usability and feasibility. Early sexual initiation remains costly to individuals, families, and society. However, development of effective sex education curricula for early adolescence has been inhibited by a lack of prevention science strategies and political issues. In answer to these challenges, Norris and Hecht/REAL Prevention created Mighty Girls (MG), a brief sexual-pressure resistance curriculum grounded in Social Cognitive Theory and the Communication Competence Model and guided by Narrative Engagement Theory. MG was developed with parents, public school educators, Planned Parenthood, and the clergy, and has demonstrated efficacy in a state with an abstinence only policy for sex and HIV prevention education. MG can be implemented as a stand-alone or component of any sex education curriculum regardless of local politics because of its focus on peer resistance and decision making. The curriculum consists of 6 brief lessons that can be taught during or after school and an interactive videogame to teach sexual pressure resistance, improve self-efficacy, and motivate resistance. However, the program targets only Latinas and technology has not adequately advanced to take the game component to scale without prohibitive costs. Hence, we propose to develop a scalable, multicultural version that relies on a narrative app, Mighty Moment, in lieu of the interactive videogame. Phase I will establish usability and appeal of the multicultural curriculum version and the app, both of which will be developed through formative work involving a multi-racial/ethnic group of 7th grade girls, and review of the evidence-based multicultural keepin’ it REAL curriculum and current literature. Additionally, the Mighty Moment app prototype will be developed in collaboration with Tapp Technologies, a leading innovator in health promotion technology. This app will guide girls in creating and narrating a story about being “Mighty” (using their “Mighty Girls” powers to resist sexual pressure without making enemies of the initiator). Phase II will evaluate MG program efficacy after incorporating social media, with girls’ stories submitted to Storybooth.Com to be selected for animation and posting on their website where such animations receive over 40 million views, creating a powerful mechanism for dissemination of peer resistance stories and intervention messages. Efficacy of the existing intervention, need for risky sex reduction interventions that surmount political barriers, and REAL Prevention’s success in commercializing health interventions through partnerships with 4-H clubs, Planned Parenthood, and D.A.R.E. America argue for the proposed project’s promise. Project findings also lay the foundation for developing a similar program for boys. This Phase I SBIR will develop and demonstrate the usability/feasibility of a multicultural adaptation Mighty Girls, an effective program for reducing risky sexual behavior among 12-14- year-old girls, that harnesses the power of mobile technology and social media using a novel story writing app. The adaptation will make Mighty Girls easily scalable as either a stand-alone or a component of school- or community-based curriculum, and capable of reaching millions of youth a year. Mighty Girls is unique from other sex and HIV prevention programs because it focuses on decision making and resisting the peer pressure that leads to risky sexual behavior, skills that are valued equally by communities that want abstinence only and communities that want abstinence plus sex education.","Mighty Girls and the Mighty Moment App:  Leveraging Innovative Technology, Narrative Theory, and Social Media to Empower Young Girls to Resist Peer Pressure to Engage in Risky Behavior",9844786,R43NR018977,"['14 year old', 'AIDS prevention', 'Abstinence', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Americas', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clergy', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Control Groups', 'Country', 'Cultural Diversity', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Ethnic group', 'Family', 'Female Adolescents', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Industry Standard', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Phase', 'Planned Parenthood Federation of America', 'Policies', 'Politics', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention education', 'Prevention program', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Puppet', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Service setting', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Problems', 'Societies', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'animation', 'base', 'boys', 'brief intervention', 'commercialization', 'computer game', 'cost', 'digital', 'early adolescence', 'early pregnancy', 'early sex initiation', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'girls', 'high risk sexual behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'meetings', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'peer', 'phase 1 study', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'school district', 'seventh grade', 'sex', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'social media', 'societal costs', 'success', 'theories', 'usability', 'web site']",NINR,"REAL PREVENTION, LLC",R43,2019,224943,0.09329010147759209
"Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods Project Summary The problem of prescription medication (PM) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. According to a 2014 report by the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), an estimated 52 million people, have been involved in the non-medical use of PMs— a significant portion of which can be classified as abuse. PMs that are commonly abused include opioids, central nervous system depressants and stimulants, and the consequences of their abuse may be severe. Increases in PM misuse and abuse over the last 15 years have resulted in increased emergency department visits, rates of addiction and overdose deaths. Due to the rapidly escalating morbidity and mortality, it is now receiving national attention. The opioid crisis, which has its root in opioid-based PM abuse, has been declared a national emergency by the president of the United States. Despite the problems associated with PM abuse, surveillance programs such as prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are inadequate and suffer from numerous shortcomings, thus limiting their usefulness in real life. Studies evaluating the long-term effects of distinct classes of PMs on cohorts of abusers are scarce and expensive to conduct. To better characterize the problem and to monitor it in real-time, new sources of information need to be identified and novel monitoring techniques need to be developed. To address these problems, our project aims to utilize social media data for performing toxicovigilance. Social media encapsulates an abundance of knowledge about PM abuse and the abusers in the form of noisy natural language text. At the heart of the proposed approach is a machine learning system that can automatically distinguish between `abuse' and `non-abuse' indicating user posts collected from social media. Using this classification system, users will be categorized into multiple groups—(i) abusers, (ii) medical users and (iii) non users. The developed system will collect longitudinal data for users exposed the selected PMs via periodic collection of their publicly available posts/discussions and automatically categorize them based on age, gender and additional demographic feature, when possible. This will enable the conducting of observational studies on targeted cohorts, involving hundreds of thousands of cohort members. The cohort studies will focus on analyzing the transition rates from medical use to abuse for distinct PMs and transition rates from abuse of PMs to illicit analogs. Implementation of this data-centric framework, which will be open source, will revolutionize the mechanism by which PM abuse monitoring is performed and enable the future development of intervention strategies targeted towards specific cohorts, at the most effective time periods. Narrative Prescription Medication (PM) abuse is a major epidemic in the United States, and monitoring and studying the characteristics of the PM abuse problem requires the development of novel approaches. Social media encapsulates an abundance of data about PM abuse from different demographics, but extracting that data and converting it to knowledge requires advanced natural language processing and data-centric artificial intelligence systems. Our proposed social media mining framework will automate the process of big data to knowledge conversion for PM abuse, providing crucial insights to toxicologists about targeted populations and enabling the future development of directed intervention strategies.",Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods,9577760,R01DA046619,"['Adderall', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Categories', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Encapsulated', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fentanyl', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Heart', 'Heroin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Oxycodone', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Percocet', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Schools', 'Social Impacts', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vicodin', 'Work', 'addiction', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analog', 'base', 'cohort', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'design', 'drug misuse', 'experimental group', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'overdose death', 'prescription drug abuse', 'prescription monitoring program', 'quetiapine', 'social media', 'spelling', 'study characteristics', 'therapy development']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,402500,0.1559631131452505
"Optimism and Exceptional Longevity Project Abstract Studies across a range of organisms establish that significant increases in longevity are often accompanied by delayed morbidity; thus research to evaluate risk factors and mechanisms underlying longevity may yield new insights for interventions to improve the public’s health with aging. In particular, African Americans experience higher mortality, and greater morbidity for many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, the most common cause of death in the U.S. Identifying new factors linked to longevity in Blacks could therefore be especially meaningful. This competing revision supplement to “Optimism and Exceptional Longevity” (R01 AG53273), is designed to enhance our research on optimism, longevity, and underlying mechanisms, by extending work on predominantly Caucasian men and women in the Nurses’ Health Study and Normative Aging Study to African Americans. Growing evidence consistently links positive psychological attributes such as optimism to favorable health outcomes, suggesting they may be powerful health assets. In our current R01 we have already found strong relations of higher optimism to lower mortality, after control for confounders including depression. Preliminary data indicate similar associations of optimism to health for White and for Black women in the Nurses’ Health Study; but, the small sample of Blacks precludes substantive research and motivates the current application. Specifically, consistent with our parent R01, we propose to conduct novel, important investigations of optimism and longevity focusing on African Americans. We will leverage existing data from the Jackson Heart Study of 5000 Black men and women, and the Women’s Health Initiative of 14,000 Black (and 135,000 White) women. In Aim 1, we will examine if optimism is related to increased likelihood of healthy behaviors (e.g., physical activity) and longevity in Blacks, as well as test health behaviors as mediators of the optimism-longevity relation. In Aim 2, we will investigate the association of optimism with slower biologic aging (e.g., leukocyte telomere length and epigenetic age, a validated score based on DNA methylation) in Blacks. We also include an exploratory Aim 3 to expand research on optimism by combining insights from natural language processing, machine learning and psychology to develop an unobtrusive measure of optimism, utilizing Facebook posts. We will develop an algorithm to measure optimism with social media data and compare it to traditional optimism scales, consider possible biases in using social media for health-related research, and begin to test the optimism algorithm against individual health outcomes. In summary, the proposed research will provide an in-depth assessment of optimism, longevity, and an array of behavioral and biological factors in African Americans, that are important in their own right and relevant to many health endpoints – suggesting novel ways to improve health. We will also begin to expand tools for measuring optimism with the goal of enabling substantial new research opportunities for studying health assets. Project Narrative Building on prior work suggesting that optimism leads to more favorable health outcomes, we propose to examine the relationship of optimism to greater longevity and to evaluate biological and behavioral mechanisms that can explain the health enhancing effects of optimism, focusing on populations including large numbers of African Americans in whom there has been limited research. In addition, we will explore development of novel, unobtrusive measures of optimism derived from social media for use in population- based research. Our proposed work has the potential to advance understanding of novel ways to increase longevity in African Americans who have higher mortality than Caucasians, and also to advance the study of health assets and health by exploring new methods of assessing optimism, a potentially potent health asset.",Optimism and Exceptional Longevity,9448464,R01AG053273,"['African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caucasians', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic Disease', 'Consent', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Length', 'Leukocytes', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Research', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'SF-36', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'health data', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimism', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'social media', 'telomere', 'tool']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2018,444351,0.09826136502407382
"HIV Prevention and Care Project Summary I propose to implement an innovative mixed methods study using machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling in combination with advanced social network analysis to provide valuable information about the online communicative and social contexts that contribute to HIV prevention and care engagement among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The study aims to answer the following questions: (1) How are the semantic features of social media communication (i.e., key terms and concepts) among YBMSM related to their HIV prevention and care engagement?; (2) How are structural features of observed social media relationships among YBMSM related to their prevention and care engagement?; and (3) Can social media use patterns predict future prevention and care engagement? To pursue these questions, I will draw on data collected March 2016-March 2019 from YBMSM participants in an ongoing network HIV prevention intervention (N=423). Prevention and care engagement behaviors include retention in care (HIV/PrEP/Primary), STI/HIV testing, and condom use. Participant social media data include: (1) Facebook posts, (2) Facebook friendships, and (3) Facebook group memberships. K99 Phase: Research conducted during the K99 Phase will use machine learning techniques for textual analysis, semantic network characterization, and regression models to identify the semantic features of participants' communication and their association with HIV prevention and care engagement. I will receive mentored training in 5 key areas: (1) knowledge of issues relevant to HIV prevention, care and treatment for MSM; (2) machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling; (3) advanced stochastic network modeling, including exponential random graph models (ERGMs); and (4) design and implementation of social media based interventions for health promotion; and (5) professional development. R00 Phase: For the R00 I will employ one-mode and two- mode ERGMs to determine how prevention and care engagement behaviors affect the structure of observed social media relationships. I will then develop a predictive model for prevention and care engagement on the basis of individuals' social media use patterns. This K99/R00 award mechanism will be critical to my success in achieving long-term success as an expert in the social and communicative dynamics of HIV prevention and care engagement in high-risk populations. It will also pave the way to an R01 application – based on a longitudinal design – of YMSMs' social and communication engagement in a more diverse array of online social networking sites, including both general purpose and dating platforms. The goal of this project will be to utilize that information to establish classes of YMSM on the basis of their heterogeneous patterns of social media use to better understand their synergistic effects on HIV prevention and care engagement practices over time. This is an important next step in understanding how online social environments impact prevention engagement and will help identify causal relationships that may be amenable to network intervention. Project Narrative This proposal is an innovative mix methods design that utilizes machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling in combination with advanced social network analysis to provide valuable information about the online communicative and social contexts that contribute to HIV prevention and care engagement among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The proposed research will sharpen our understanding of the degree to which online social environments support protective or risky behavioral norms and, consequently the degree to which they reveal viable points for intervention. It will also demonstrate how social media data can help front-line staff profile clients in near real-time and predict future HIV-related outcomes like retention failure, thereby serving as an indicator to guide decisions on screening, treatment, and other service provisions.",HIV Prevention and Care,9623550,K99HD094648,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Friends', 'Friendships', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Group Affiliation', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'HIV/STD', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterosexuals', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Service provision', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Site', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Network', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'black men who have sex with men', 'cohort', 'condoms', 'design', 'digital', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal design', 'meetings', 'men who have sex with men', 'network models', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer networks', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'predictive modeling', 'protective behavior', 'response', 'screening', 'sexual health intervention', 'social', 'social communication', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'socialization behavior', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'willingness', 'young adult', 'young men who have sex with men']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K99,2018,94832,0.19202059313035075
"Mining Social Media Messages for HIV Testing and Prevention Communication PROJECT SUMMARY With the advent of Big Data methods, social media is the proverbial low-hanging fruit to disseminate HIV prevention and testing messages on a large scale 1,2. These media already transmit messages on condom use, HIV testing, and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), from government institutions, NGOs, private citizens, and community groups, but it does so in an informal way. This real-time repository of real-world health messages, along with our ability to mine and pinpoint counties that need to engage in a conversation about HIV prevention and testing, offers a unique opportunity to develop Big Data methods for geographically targeted message dissemination. Despite some interventions designed for online delivery 3–19, the overall potential of social media and their most promising contents (e.g., actionable messages with behavioral instructions) have surprisingly not been established to date. Our project will focus on the disease-burdened population of Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM), and will develop a highly significant computing infrastructure (Aim 1) to automatically and continuously input social media postings from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, behavioral data from the American Men Internet Survey (AMIS), and HIV prevalence data from AIDSVu.org, and using that triangulation, to target counties that need social media messages about condom use, HIV testing, and/or PrEP for MSM. Using machine learning methods, the same platform will then select actionable and acceptable messages to fill county gaps. Once the platform has been refined with input from research participants who are employees of health departments, it will be used to send experimental messages (Aim 2), selected to match county needs, and to be actionable and acceptable to a group of health departments randomized to the experimental condition. The success of the experimental messages will be gauged by the hallmarks of social media, repostings, Likes, Dislike, and comment favorability, compared with the success of a random selection of HIV-relevant messages sent to a different group of health departments randomized to the control condition. The project is innovative in several ways. First, the social media messages will involve diverse inputs (text, images, videos) never before brought together in this area. Second, we are not aware of the prior use of the proposed triangulation involving epidemiological, behavioral, and social media data. Third, a method of mining naturally accruing messages will be new and transformative, allowing for the generation of “live” campaigns with messages selected that remain current, sustainable, and community-based by design. Further, the use of an implementation-science experiment at a large, geographically distributed, scale is highly novel. These research aims are facilitated by unique team expertise about communication and persuasion, Big Data methods, public health, and Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling, and leading institutions in the areas of psychology, public health, and computer science. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is concerned with identifying a method to disseminate public health information through social media in an optimal way.

"Social Media Mining for Pharmacovigilance Project Summary Drugs undergo extensive testing in animals and clinical trials in humans before they are marketed for widespread use. Pre-market testing produces reasonably high quality information about the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the condition for which it was approved, but gives a very incomplete picture of the drug's safety. It is only after a drug is marketed and used on a more widespread basis over longer periods of time that it is possible to identify other effects, such as rare but serious adverse effects, or those that are more common in the special subgroups excluded from the trial (such as pregnant women), or effects of long-term use of the drug, among others. Despite the increase in research in the past years exploring social media data for pharmacovigilance, and the evidence that it indeed can bring forward the patient perspective, there is no systematic approach to collect and annotate such data for research purposes. This renewal builds on our prior research and natural language processing (NLP) methods for social media mining in pharmacovigilance to make the collection of social media data about medication use precise and systematic enough to be useful to researchers and the public, alongside established sources such as the FDA's data and other public collections of drug adverse event data. It presents innovative methods to automatically collect and analyze longitudinal health data, piloting methods for interventions through the same media that can inform the public and help validate the automatic methods. As validation, we include a comparison to an existing reference standard for adverse effects that integrates FDA's data and HER data, as well as specific case studies focused on (Aim 3.1) the use of NSAIDs and anti-depressants in pregnancy and (Aim 3.2) factors for non-adherence. Project Narrative Pre-market testing of medications produces reasonably high quality information about the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the condition for which it was approved, but gives a very incomplete picture of the drug's safety. It is only after a drug is marketed and used on a more widespread basis over longer periods of time that it is possible to identify other effects, such as rare but serious adverse effects, or those that are more common in the special subgroups excluded from the trial (such as pregnant women), or effects of long-term use of the drug, among others. This renewal application builds on our prior research and natural language processing (NLP), developing novel methods for data extraction that makes it possible to integrate information from social media with existing drug safety information and extract health data over time.",Social Media Mining for Pharmacovigilance,9598270,R01LM011176,"['Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Animals', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Case Study', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consent', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fetal Death', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hepatic', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Live Birth', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'MEDLINE', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'cohort', 'dosage', 'drug efficacy', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'health data', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'language processing', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'social media', 'systematic review', 'treatment duration']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,660242,0.18431689364308915
"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors.

"Supplementing Survey-Based Analyses of Group Vaccination Narratives and Behaviors Using Social Media DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High quality, real-time data is essential in public health crises. Yet, traditional survey methods that rely on random-digit-dialing are expensive, difficult to deploy instantly, and fail to sample hard-to-reach populations without landline telephones, such as young adults (18-30) and minorities. In contrast, these groups heavily use social media. Twitter, in particular, is widely available and immediate, providing a rich data source that can be used to pilot hypotheses at minimal cost. These hypotheses can then be modified prior to a more in-depth study. Social media data pose challenges for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data. We will therefore develop and test an innovative computational tool that overcomes these challenges. This tool will supplement traditional survey techniques by facilitating real-time data gathering and rigorous quantitative analysis of social media data related to health narratives, attitudes, and behaviors. We will validate our tool by comparing existing survey data to social media data about influenza vaccination among adults 18-30, adult African Americans, and non-White Hispanics of all ages - three demographic categories with the highest rates of social media use, lower rates of participation in survey research, and lowest rates of seasonal flu vaccination. Thus, our tool will enable theory building. We will test hypotheses derived from the health communication literature, especially regarding how group attitudes form and change, categorize attitudes and collective narratives by existing theories and conceptual models, and build new theory to capture emerging and previously unidentified concepts. Finally, we disseminate our results and novel techniques using a website, vaccinetrends.org, that provides processed social media data to the research community. Our approach offers inexpensive, immediate access to the attitudes of these groups, transcending traditional constraints of time, money, and data access. Our approach is novel because it combines the strengths of social media analysis with those of validated survey techniques. We will draw upon two complementary population samples, representing different timescales and demographics, in order to test hypotheses in a manner that is rapid yet rigorous. In addition, our social media analysis will draw upon novel techniques to infer demographic information and social group membership, enabling the extraction of master narratives - attitudes and content that are associated with rationales for vaccine refusal and, ultimately, behavior. In addition, we will develop tools and techniques that can be adopted by researchers throughout the social, computer, and health sciences. Finally, we draw upon a much more extensive data source than has been found in previous work, including billions of Twitter messages and public forum information that will enable in-depth automated content analysis of vaccine refusal rationales.

"Mining the Social Web to Monitor Public Health and HIV Risk Behaviors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surveillance and monitoring of risk behavior and disease is a top priority of many health-related agencies and organizations, including the UN AIDS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and local public health and epidemiology departments. Identification and localization of changes in risk behaviors and disease can dramatically improve public health outcomes and reduce health-related costs, by providing data on where interventions are needed and how to direct public health efforts. For example, HIV researchers, public health departments, and government organizations, have attempted to identify and monitor HIV risk behavior (e.g., sexual intercourse and illicit drug use) and HIV outbreaks to improve prevention and treatment efforts and curb a growing HIV epidemic. Social media use has been rapidly increasing, and data from these technologies might be leveraged for identification of HIV risk behaviors, such as sexual- and drug-related risk behaviors. Although researchers have developed methods of using social media to monitor HIV and public health behaviors and outcomes, these methods require extensive manual time, technical expertise, and multiple software platforms to process these big data. Advances in technology, including technology infrastructure, data mining, and machine learning approaches, can be leveraged to provide tools that can be used to create a single automated platform for extracting free-text social media conversations, labeling these conversations to identify health risk-related behaviors, and using these labels to monitor disease outbreaks. We propose to create a single automated platform that collects social media (Twitter) data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV risk behaviors; and provides an output that is acceptable for HIV researchers, public health workers, and policymakers to monitor HIV risk behaviors and outcomes. The tools developed from this application will be open source, tailored for use for epidemiologists and public health departments, and will be available for integration with other software tools to improve the effectiveness of public health monitoring systems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surveillance and monitoring of health-related risk behavior is a top priority of many agencies and organizations.

"Trending:  Social media analysis to monitor cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cannabis remains one of the most commonly used psychoactive substances in the U.S., and current changes in legalization policy indicate broadening acceptability. At the same time, substance abusers have sought similar, or more enhanced highs, through use of synthetic cannabinoids, new designer drugs with constantly changing chemical formulations that have been linked to adverse health effects and present significant challenges to public health. Submitted in response to NIDA RFA-CA-14-008 (Research Area 1), this multi-PI study builds on multidisciplinary collaboration between the researchers in the Center for Interventions, Treatment, and Addictions Research, and the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing at Wright State University to develop an innovative software platform, eDrugTrends, that will facilitate analysis of trends in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to the use of cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids as discussed on Web forums and Twitter. To date, no one has developed a computer platform capable of collecting and semi-automatically analyzing data from these two complementary social media sources. We will build on the existing infrastructure developed by our interdisciplinary research team: Twitris, a robust and highly scalable platform designed to analyze Twitter data, and PREDOSE, a platform developed for our collaborative NIH grant (R21 DA030571) to analyze Web forum data on illegal buprenorphine use. Key elements of Twitris and PREDOSE will be adapted and enhanced using Semantic Web, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning techniques to advance the analysis of social media data for drug abuse research and is thus maximally responsive to the RFA. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Develop a comprehensive software platform, eDrugTrends, for semi-automated processing and visualization of thematic, sentiment, spatio-temporal, and social network dimensions of social media data (Twitter and Web forums) on cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use. 2) Deploy eDrugTrends to: a) Identify and compare trends in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use across U.S. regions with different cannabis legalization policies using Twitter and Web forum data. b) Analyze social network characteristics and identify key influencers (opinions leaders) in cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid-related discussions on Twitter. The development of eDrugTrends will advance the field's technological and methodological capabilities, and our deployment of the platform will inform the field on new trends regarding the use of cannabis, synthetic cannabinoids and other drugs. eDrugTrends will have high public health impact by providing a tool that can be used to inform more timely interventions and policy responses to changes in cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use and associated harms. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Building on inter-disciplinary collaboration between substance abuse researchers and computer scientists, we will develop and deploy an innovative software platform, eDrugTrends, to facilitate analysis of Twitter and Web forum data on cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use. The study will contribute to the advancement of social media surveillance methods to improve public health, and it will provide timely information on emerging trends in the context of changing cannabis laws in the U.S. that can ultimately be used to inform interventions and policy.",Trending:  Social media analysis to monitor cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use,9112982,R01DA039454,"['Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cannabis', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Designer Drugs', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'K2/Spice', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ohio', 'Online Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Seizures', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'addiction', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'computer science', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'meetings', 'mental state', 'multidisciplinary', 'regional difference', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'substance abuse epidemiology', 'substance abuser', 'success', 'synthetic cannabinoid', 'tool', 'trend', 'trend analysis']",NIDA,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,460736,0.2261136397446033

Although the Internet has yet to realize its full potential for health-related communication, about 87% of US adults have used the Internet to look for health information, and a large majority of younger Americans report they would share personal health information on social media sites. Thus, pushing the current boundaries to capitalize on social media to inform decision-making about cancer screening and prevention offers great potential. The long-term goals of this research are to 1) generate validated methodologies to systematically study social media content, and 2) promote cervical cancer screening and prevention more effectively using social media. In pursuit of these goals, we will used a novel methodological approaches to characterize cervical cancer content present in social media and then to create and test messages within an experimental online social network. In Aim 1, we will identify and rank the key words related to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in social media messages. We will identify statistically significant phrases that are co-occurring in messages drawn from six months of publically available content from Twitter and Facebook. This technique will allow us to synthesize the entire breadth of content on screening and vaccination on social media, and to extract the full-text of messages corresponding to the most common significant words/ phrases. In Aim 2, we will categorize and validate the range of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination discussion on social media websites. We will use qualitative content analysis informed by grounded theory to analyze a random sample of the findings from Aim 1, coding a minimum of 1500 messages. This will allow us to gain an in-depth understanding of the range of real-life discussions online. This will also serve as the validation of the machine learning result from Aim 1, as well as the basis for the development of new cervical cancer prevention messages that will be tested in Aim 3. Building upon both of these aims, in Aim 3, we will create tailored cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination messages and track responses and spread in an online social network. Using the content knowledge from Aims 1 & 2, we will create tailored messages about cervical cancer screening and prevention and then pre-test them using virtual focus groups to gain insights from our target audience. We will establish a simulated online network to evaluate the spread of these messages, as each network member can directly share health opinions with others in the study. Within this setting, we will be able to determine the diffusion of specific, effective screening messages, as well as determine what types of network structures and message authors have the biggest impact. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We plan to study publicly available messages on online social media websites (for example, Twitter and Facebook) related to cervical cancer screening and prevention, such as comments about Pap smears. We will determine the major discussion topics on these websites, and then use this information to craft new messages about cervical cancer prevention. Finally, in an experiment, we will test how these messages are shared between individuals - in order to learn how public health agencies and researchers can improve their online health-related communication strategies to promote cervical cancer screening.",Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media,9122340,R01CA178875,"['Adult', 'American', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pap smear', 'Perception', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'girls', 'health organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phrases', 'racial and ethnic', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'web site']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,386725,0.2746369061841274
"Detecting Youth Drinking and Associations with Alcohol Policies via Social Media ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The magnitude and cost of alcohol and other drug (AOD) related problems originating in adolescence make it especially vital to monitor these behaviors, identify high-risk groups and evaluate preventive interventions such as policy measures. Adolescent substance use is associated with the four leading causes of morbidity and mortality in this age group and results in more than $25 billion in direct costs due to medical care and lost time at work annually. Denominator-based health surveillance systems provide population-representative structured data to inform policy and guide clinical and research objectives to address this problem. However, survey timeframes and sampling frames do not support real-time monitoring, robust subgroup investigation, flexible follow up or feedback of health alerts and information to subjects. Harnessing youth engagement with online social media to derive timely information about alcohol use behaviors and problems may accelerate public health awareness and drive targeted responses. The purpose of our project is to develop a new approach to public health surveillance of underage drinking that centers on mining social media communications in Facebook. The approach may: fill gaps in knowledge about risky, stigmatizing or sensitive behaviors; describe subgroups of youth who may not have opportunity/willingness to report about risk behaviors to public health authorities or clinicians; accelerate detection of trends to ""real time""; and, enable evaluation of policy interventions to resolve impacts at greater temporal-social-geographic levels. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 - Derive metrics of underage alcohol consumption from user-generated Facebook data, testing correspondence of social media and traditional surveillance reports at the state level. The approach is to collect text reports from the public profiles of US Facebook users ages 13-20 years, creating alcohol use metrics from these data by parsing, filtering and classifying them using machine learning techniques. The main hypotheses are that (1.a) patterns of underage drinking derived from social media will correlate with traditional surveillance reports and (1.b) vary in relation to seasons/events. Aim 2 - Establish the relationship between validated measures of the alcohol policy environment and measures of youth alcohol consumption obtained from social media. The approach is to ascertain associations among extant, validated alcohol policy scores measured at the state level and social media sourced measures of underage drinking and harms (from Aim 1). The main hypothesis is that social media metrics of underage alcohol use will be associated with alcohol policy at the state level. By utilizing the expertise of an experienced multidisciplinary team and a comprehensive rigorous approach, we anticipate findings that will advance public health methods for monitoring underage drinking and harms and generate a paradigm shift for policy evaluation by enabling real-time investigation of impacts at fine temporal- spatial resolution. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The magnitude of alcohol problems originating in adolescence make it one of the greatest and costliest health problems for this age group. In this work, we will derive and validate metrics of alcohol consumption from information posted on Facebook by underage youth from all 50 US states, and establish the relationship between these social media sourced metrics and surrounding state alcohol policies. Findings will enable a new approach to population surveillance of underage drinking that will complement traditional systems.",Detecting Youth Drinking and Associations with Alcohol Policies via Social Media,9069662,R21AA023901,"['Absenteeism at work', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Americas', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Drug usage', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Federal Government', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Household', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Local Government', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Seasons', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'State Government', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'age group', 'alcohol and other drug', 'authority', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'drinking', 'environmental intervention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'primary outcome', 'public policy on alcohol', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'temporal measurement', 'trend', 'underage drinking', 'willingness']",NIAAA,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,210188,0.1441030282136085
"Supplementing Survey-Based Analyses of Group Vaccination Narratives and Behaviors Using Social Media DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High quality, real-time data is essential in public health crises. Yet, traditional survey methods that rely on random-digit-dialing are expensive, difficult to deploy instantly, and fail to sample hard-to-reach populations without landline telephones, such as young adults (18-30) and minorities. In contrast, these groups heavily use social media. Twitter, in particular, is widely available and immediate, providing a rich data source that can be used to pilot hypotheses at minimal cost. These hypotheses can then be modified prior to a more in-depth study. Social media data pose challenges for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data. We will therefore develop and test an innovative computational tool that overcomes these challenges. This tool will supplement traditional survey techniques by facilitating real-time data gathering and rigorous quantitative analysis of social media data related to health narratives, attitudes, and behaviors. We will validate our tool by comparing existing survey data to social media data about influenza vaccination among adults 18-30, adult African Americans, and non-White Hispanics of all ages - three demographic categories with the highest rates of social media use, lower rates of participation in survey research, and lowest rates of seasonal flu vaccination. Thus, our tool will enable theory building. We will test hypotheses derived from the health communication literature, especially regarding how group attitudes form and change, categorize attitudes and collective narratives by existing theories and conceptual models, and build new theory to capture emerging and previously unidentified concepts. Finally, we disseminate our results and novel techniques using a website, vaccinetrends.org, that provides processed social media data to the research community. Our approach offers inexpensive, immediate access to the attitudes of these groups, transcending traditional constraints of time, money, and data access. Our approach is novel because it combines the strengths of social media analysis with those of validated survey techniques. We will draw upon two complementary population samples, representing different timescales and demographics, in order to test hypotheses in a manner that is rapid yet rigorous. In addition, our social media analysis will draw upon novel techniques to infer demographic information and social group membership, enabling the extraction of master narratives - attitudes and content that are associated with rationales for vaccine refusal and, ultimately, behavior. In addition, we will develop tools and techniques that can be adopted by researchers throughout the social, computer, and health sciences. Finally, we draw upon a much more extensive data source than has been found in previous work, including billions of Twitter messages and public forum information that will enable in-depth automated content analysis of vaccine refusal rationales. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses challenges that social media data pose for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data.

"Trending:  Social media analysis to monitor cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cannabis remains one of the most commonly used psychoactive substances in the U.S., and current changes in legalization policy indicate broadening acceptability. At the same time, substance abusers have sought similar, or more enhanced highs, through use of synthetic cannabinoids, new designer drugs with constantly changing chemical formulations that have been linked to adverse health effects and present significant challenges to public health. Submitted in response to NIDA RFA-CA-14-008 (Research Area 1), this multi-PI study builds on multidisciplinary collaboration between the researchers in the Center for Interventions, Treatment, and Addictions Research, and the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing at Wright State University to develop an innovative software platform, eDrugTrends, that will facilitate analysis of trends in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to the use of cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids as discussed on Web forums and Twitter. To date, no one has developed a computer platform capable of collecting and semi-automatically analyzing data from these two complementary social media sources. We will build on the existing infrastructure developed by our interdisciplinary research team: Twitris, a robust and highly scalable platform designed to analyze Twitter data, and PREDOSE, a platform developed for our collaborative NIH grant (R21 DA030571) to analyze Web forum data on illegal buprenorphine use. Key elements of Twitris and PREDOSE will be adapted and enhanced using Semantic Web, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning techniques to advance the analysis of social media data for drug abuse research and is thus maximally responsive to the RFA. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Develop a comprehensive software platform, eDrugTrends, for semi-automated processing and visualization of thematic, sentiment, spatio-temporal, and social network dimensions of social media data (Twitter and Web forums) on cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use. 2) Deploy eDrugTrends to: a) Identify and compare trends in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use across U.S. regions with different cannabis legalization policies using Twitter and Web forum data. b) Analyze social network characteristics and identify key influencers (opinions leaders) in cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid-related discussions on Twitter. The development of eDrugTrends will advance the field's technological and methodological capabilities, and our deployment of the platform will inform the field on new trends regarding the use of cannabis, synthetic cannabinoids and other drugs. eDrugTrends will have high public health impact by providing a tool that can be used to inform more timely interventions and policy responses to changes in cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use and associated harms. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Building on inter-disciplinary collaboration between substance abuse researchers and computer scientists, we will develop and deploy an innovative software platform, eDrugTrends, to facilitate analysis of Twitter and Web forum data on cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use. The study will contribute to the advancement of social media surveillance methods to improve public health, and it will provide timely information on emerging trends in the context of changing cannabis laws in the U.S. that can ultimately be used to inform interventions and policy.",Trending:  Social media analysis to monitor cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use,8913112,R01DA039454,"['Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cannabis', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Designer Drugs', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'K2/Spice', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ohio', 'Online Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Seizures', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'addiction', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'computer science', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'meetings', 'mental state', 'multidisciplinary', 'regional difference', 'response', 'social', 'substance abuse epidemiology', 'substance abuser', 'success', 'synthetic cannabinoid', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDA,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,461348,0.2261136397446033
"Mining the Social Web to Monitor Public Health and HIV Risk Behaviors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surveillance and monitoring of risk behavior and disease is a top priority of many health-related agencies and organizations, including the UN AIDS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and local public health and epidemiology departments. Identification and localization of changes in risk behaviors and disease can dramatically improve public health outcomes and reduce health-related costs, by providing data on where interventions are needed and how to direct public health efforts. For example, HIV researchers, public health departments, and government organizations, have attempted to identify and monitor HIV risk behavior (e.g., sexual intercourse and illicit drug use) and HIV outbreaks to improve prevention and treatment efforts and curb a growing HIV epidemic. Social media use has been rapidly increasing, and data from these technologies might be leveraged for identification of HIV risk behaviors, such as sexual- and drug-related risk behaviors. Although researchers have developed methods of using social media to monitor HIV and public health behaviors and outcomes, these methods require extensive manual time, technical expertise, and multiple software platforms to process these big data. Advances in technology, including technology infrastructure, data mining, and machine learning approaches, can be leveraged to provide tools that can be used to create a single automated platform for extracting free-text social media conversations, labeling these conversations to identify health risk-related behaviors, and using these labels to monitor disease outbreaks. We propose to create a single automated platform that collects social media (Twitter) data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV risk behaviors; and provides an output that is acceptable for HIV researchers, public health workers, and policymakers to monitor HIV risk behaviors and outcomes. The tools developed from this application will be open source, tailored for use for epidemiologists and public health departments, and will be available for integration with other software tools to improve the effectiveness of public health monitoring systems.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surveillance and monitoring of health-related risk behavior is a top priority of many agencies and organizations. This project is particularly significant because it seeks to develop software to allow researchers and epidemiologists to analyze real-time free-text conversations from social media to monitor HIV and public health-related risk behaviors and disease outbreaks. Results can be used to provide additional observational and surveillance data and to improve future intervention delivery.            ",Mining the Social Web to Monitor Public Health and HIV Risk Behaviors,8876480,U01HG008488,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Code', 'Coitus', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Government', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior outcomes', 'Human Resources', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral outcome', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'open source', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'software development', 'statistics', 'surveillance data', 'tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2015,380191,0.07781951021551517
"Moving beyond description: Statistical and casual inference for social media data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human interactions via internet and mobile apps are increasing and ubiquitous among all walks of life. Young and older adults are prolific in these media, as well as public and private agencies seeking to promote health behaviors and communications. Over 500 million users are registered to Twitter.com, a microblogging and social network service that conveys text messages to a restricted set of followers. Given current new user registration rates, Twitter may reach over one billion users in the next year. Over 50% of nonprofits using social media sites employ Twitter, the second highest used social media application after Facebook. Every second, 2,200 new Tweets appear offering timely broadcasts about users' current states, interests and ideas. Bigdata sources such as Twitter afford new potential in combining ""real-time"" spatial and social networking information to study causal processes underlying who, where and how individuals are connected. These key features are lacking in the traditional research designs and intervention strategies for health and health-related behaviors. For example, social network analysis (SNA), a strand of systems science, offers a unique lens to understand how human interactions through social network may collectively optimize mental health outcomes in social and geographic ""locations."" The ability to model attributes of nodes and tie strength makes SNA a powerful descriptive and predictive method. Network analyses can capture integration and fragmentation, concepts integral to prevention system planning. Indeed, novel mixed methods of SNA with machine learning can enhance prediction of flu spread in a large real-world population and future criminal incidents in a real city. The goal of this project is to develop and apply a new class of statistical and causal inference models for human interactions and their impacts on health and health-related behavioral outcomes using network data from social media sources such as Twitter.com by focusing on three research studies that integrate online social media information to understand the roles of human interaction on (a) disease spread, (b) mental health in a hard-to-reach population, and (c) presence and extent of ""natural helping"" in promoting wellness and reducing norms supporting violence in low-income urban neighborhoods. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will impact behavioral and social health sciences, including systems science communities, broadly and specifically by: (a) filling a critical gap in the literature on causal inference models for social network interactions, (b) strengthening the evidence base for how social media is used and affecting health related outcomes and behaviors, and (c) improving community capacity-building in health. n/a",Moving beyond description: Statistical and casual inference for social media data,8826778,R01GM108337,"['Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cities', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Future', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Science', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'State Interests', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Violence', 'Walking', 'behavioral outcome', 'citizen science', 'evidence base', 'flu', 'improved', 'lens', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'research study', 'social', 'young adult']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2015,207182,0.2425951167340208

Findings will enable a new approach to population surveillance of underage drinking that will complement traditional systems.                ",Detecting Youth Drinking and Associations with Alcohol Policies via Social Media,8870480,R21AA023901,"['Absenteeism at work', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Americas', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Complement', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Drug usage', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Federal Government', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Household', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Local Government', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Seasons', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Characteristics', 'State Government', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'age group', 'alcohol and other drug', 'authority', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'drinking', 'environmental intervention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'primary outcome', 'public health relevance', 'public policy on alcohol', 'response', 'social', 'temporal measurement', 'trend', 'underage drinking', 'willingness']",NIAAA,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2015,254198,0.1441030282136085
"Supplementing Survey-Based Analyses of Group Vaccination Narratives and Behaviors Using Social Media     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High quality, real-time data is essential in public health crises. Yet, traditional survey methods that rely on random-digit-dialing are expensive, difficult to deploy instantly, and fail to sample hard-to-reach populations without landline telephones, such as young adults (18-30) and minorities. In contrast, these groups heavily use social media. Twitter, in particular, is widely available and immediate, providing a rich data source that can be used to pilot hypotheses at minimal cost. These hypotheses can then be modified prior to a more in-depth study. Social media data pose challenges for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data. We will therefore develop and test an innovative computational tool that overcomes these challenges. This tool will supplement traditional survey techniques by facilitating real-time data gathering and rigorous quantitative analysis of social media data related to health narratives, attitudes, and behaviors. We will validate our tool by comparing existing survey data to social media data about influenza vaccination among adults 18-30, adult African Americans, and non-White Hispanics of all ages - three demographic categories with the highest rates of social media use, lower rates of participation in survey research, and lowest rates of seasonal flu vaccination. Thus, our tool will enable theory building. We will test hypotheses derived from the health communication literature, especially regarding how group attitudes form and change, categorize attitudes and collective narratives by existing theories and conceptual models, and build new theory to capture emerging and previously unidentified concepts. Finally, we disseminate our results and novel techniques using a website, vaccinetrends.org, that provides processed social media data to the research community. Our approach offers inexpensive, immediate access to the attitudes of these groups, transcending traditional constraints of time, money, and data access. Our approach is novel because it combines the strengths of social media analysis with those of validated survey techniques. We will draw upon two complementary population samples, representing different timescales and demographics, in order to test hypotheses in a manner that is rapid yet rigorous. In addition, our social media analysis will draw upon novel techniques to infer demographic information and social group membership, enabling the extraction of master narratives - attitudes and content that are associated with rationales for vaccine refusal and, ultimately, behavior. In addition, we will develop tools and techniques that can be adopted by researchers throughout the social, computer, and health sciences. Finally, we draw upon a much more extensive data source than has been found in previous work, including billions of Twitter messages and public forum information that will enable in-depth automated content analysis of vaccine refusal rationales.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses challenges that social media data pose for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data.

"Trending:  Social media analysis to monitor cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cannabis remains one of the most commonly used psychoactive substances in the U.S., and current changes in legalization policy indicate broadening acceptability. At the same time, substance abusers have sought similar, or more enhanced highs, through use of synthetic cannabinoids, new designer drugs with constantly changing chemical formulations that have been linked to adverse health effects and present significant challenges to public health. Submitted in response to NIDA RFA-CA-14-008 (Research Area 1), this multi-PI study builds on multidisciplinary collaboration between the researchers in the Center for Interventions, Treatment, and Addictions Research, and the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing at Wright State University to develop an innovative software platform, eDrugTrends, that will facilitate analysis of trends in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to the use of cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids as discussed on Web forums and Twitter. To date, no one has developed a computer platform capable of collecting and semi-automatically analyzing data from these two complementary social media sources. We will build on the existing infrastructure developed by our interdisciplinary research team: Twitris, a robust and highly scalable platform designed to analyze Twitter data, and PREDOSE, a platform developed for our collaborative NIH grant (R21 DA030571) to analyze Web forum data on illegal buprenorphine use. Key elements of Twitris and PREDOSE will be adapted and enhanced using Semantic Web, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning techniques to advance the analysis of social media data for drug abuse research and is thus maximally responsive to the RFA. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Develop a comprehensive software platform, eDrugTrends, for semi-automated processing and visualization of thematic, sentiment, spatio-temporal, and social network dimensions of social media data (Twitter and Web forums) on cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use. 2) Deploy eDrugTrends to: a) Identify and compare trends in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use across U.S. regions with different cannabis legalization policies using Twitter and Web forum data. b) Analyze social network characteristics and identify key influencers (opinions leaders) in cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid-related discussions on Twitter. The development of eDrugTrends will advance the field's technological and methodological capabilities, and our deployment of the platform will inform the field on new trends regarding the use of cannabis, synthetic cannabinoids and other drugs. eDrugTrends will have high public health impact by providing a tool that can be used to inform more timely interventions and policy responses to changes in cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use and associated harms.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Building on inter-disciplinary collaboration between substance abuse researchers and computer scientists, we will develop and deploy an innovative software platform, eDrugTrends, to facilitate analysis of Twitter and Web forum data on cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use. The study will contribute to the advancement of social media surveillance methods to improve public health, and it will provide timely information on emerging trends in the context of changing cannabis laws in the U.S. that can ultimately be used to inform interventions and policy.            ",Trending:  Social media analysis to monitor cannabis and synthetic cannabinoid use,8827089,R01DA039454,"['Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cannabis', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Designer Drugs', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ohio', 'Online Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Seizures', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Spices', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'addiction', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'computer science', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mental state', 'multidisciplinary', 'public health relevance', 'regional difference', 'response', 'social', 'substance abuse epidemiology', 'substance abuser', 'success', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDA,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,506725,0.2261136397446033
"Moving beyond description: Statistical and casual inference for social media data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human interactions via internet and mobile apps are increasing and ubiquitous among all walks of life. Young and older adults are prolific in these media, as well as public and private agencies seeking to promote health behaviors and communications. Over 500 million users are registered to Twitter.com, a microblogging and social network service that conveys text messages to a restricted set of followers. Given current new user registration rates, Twitter may reach over one billion users in the next year. Over 50% of nonprofits using social media sites employ Twitter, the second highest used social media application after Facebook. Every second, 2,200 new Tweets appear offering timely broadcasts about users' current states, interests and ideas. Bigdata sources such as Twitter afford new potential in combining ""real-time"" spatial and social networking information to study causal processes underlying who, where and how individuals are connected. These key features are lacking in the traditional research designs and intervention strategies for health and health-related behaviors. For example, social network analysis (SNA), a strand of systems science, offers a unique lens to understand how human interactions through social network may collectively optimize mental health outcomes in social and geographic ""locations."" The ability to model attributes of nodes and tie strength makes SNA a powerful descriptive and predictive method. Network analyses can capture integration and fragmentation, concepts integral to prevention system planning.

"Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread availability and known effectiveness, Pap smear screening and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination rates remain below national targets. New modes of online communication through social media - which have transformed information sharing, especially for younger individuals - present opportunities to target health communication more effectively to improve cervical cancer prevention. Although the Internet has yet to realize its full potential for health-related communication, about 87% of US adults have used the Internet to look for health information, and a large majority of younger Americans report they would share personal health information on social media sites. Thus, pushing the current boundaries to capitalize on social media to inform decision-making about cancer screening and prevention offers great potential. The long-term goals of this research are to 1) generate validated methodologies to systematically study social media content, and 2) promote cervical cancer screening and prevention more effectively using social media. In pursuit of these goals, we will used a novel methodological approaches to characterize cervical cancer content present in social media and then to create and test messages within an experimental online social network. In Aim 1, we will identify and rank the key words related to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in social media messages. We will identify statistically significant phrases that are co-occurring in messages drawn from six months of publically available content from Twitter and Facebook. This technique will allow us to synthesize the entire breadth of content on screening and vaccination on social media, and to extract the full-text of messages corresponding to the most common significant words/ phrases. In Aim 2, we will categorize and validate the range of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination discussion on social media websites. We will use qualitative content analysis informed by grounded theory to analyze a random sample of the findings from Aim 1, coding a minimum of 1500 messages. This will allow us to gain an in-depth understanding of the range of real-life discussions online. This will also serve as the validation of the machine learning result from Aim 1, as well as the basis for the development of new cervical cancer prevention messages that will be tested in Aim 3. Building upon both of these aims, in Aim 3, we will create tailored cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination messages and track responses and spread in an online social network. Using the content knowledge from Aims 1 & 2, we will create tailored messages about cervical cancer screening and prevention and then pre-test them using virtual focus groups to gain insights from our target audience. We will establish a simulated online network to evaluate the spread of these messages, as each network member can directly share health opinions with others in the study. Within this setting, we will be able to determine the diffusion of specific, effective screening messages, as well as determine what types of network structures and message authors have the biggest impact.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We plan to study publicly available messages on online social media websites (for example, Twitter and Facebook) related to cervical cancer screening and prevention, such as comments about Pap smears. We will determine the major discussion topics on these websites, and then use this information to craft new messages about cervical cancer prevention. Finally, in an experiment, we will test how these messages are shared between individuals - in order to learn how public health agencies and researchers can improve their online health-related communication strategies to promote cervical cancer screening.                ",Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media,8693710,R01CA178875,"['Adult', 'American', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pap smear', 'Perception', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'experience', 'girls', 'health organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'social networking website', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'web site', 'web-based social networking']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2014,504210,0.2746369061841274

"Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods Project Summary The problem of prescription medication (PM) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. According to a 2014 report by the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), an estimated 52 million people, have been involved in the non-medical use of PMs— a significant portion of which can be classified as abuse. PMs that are commonly abused include opioids, central nervous system depressants and stimulants, and the consequences of their abuse may be severe. Increases in PM misuse and abuse over the last 15 years have resulted in increased emergency department visits, rates of addiction and overdose deaths. Due to the rapidly escalating morbidity and mortality, it is now receiving national attention. The opioid crisis, which has its root in opioid-based PM abuse, has been declared a national emergency by the president of the United States. Despite the problems associated with PM abuse, surveillance programs such as prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are inadequate and suffer from numerous shortcomings, thus limiting their usefulness in real life. Studies evaluating the long-term effects of distinct classes of PMs on cohorts of abusers are scarce and expensive to conduct. To better characterize the problem and to monitor it in real-time, new sources of information need to be identified and novel monitoring techniques need to be developed. To address these problems, our project aims to utilize social media data for performing toxicovigilance. Social media encapsulates an abundance of knowledge about PM abuse and the abusers in the form of noisy natural language text. At the heart of the proposed approach is a machine learning system that can automatically distinguish between `abuse' and `non-abuse' indicating user posts collected from social media. Using this classification system, users will be categorized into multiple groups—(i) abusers, (ii) medical users and (iii) non users. The developed system will collect longitudinal data for users exposed the selected PMs via periodic collection of their publicly available posts/discussions and automatically categorize them based on age, gender and additional demographic feature, when possible. This will enable the conducting of observational studies on targeted cohorts, involving hundreds of thousands of cohort members. The cohort studies will focus on analyzing the transition rates from medical use to abuse for distinct PMs and transition rates from abuse of PMs to illicit analogs. Implementation of this data-centric framework, which will be open source, will revolutionize the mechanism by which PM abuse monitoring is performed and enable the future development of intervention strategies targeted towards specific cohorts, at the most effective time periods. Narrative Prescription Medication (PM) abuse is a major epidemic in the United States, and monitoring and studying the characteristics of the PM abuse problem requires the development of novel approaches. Social media encapsulates an abundance of data about PM abuse from different demographics, but extracting that data and converting it to knowledge requires advanced natural language processing and data-centric artificial intelligence systems. Our proposed social media mining framework will automate the process of big data to knowledge conversion for PM abuse, providing crucial insights to toxicologists about targeted populations and enabling the future development of directed intervention strategies.",Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods,9933852,R01DA046619,"['Adderall', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Categories', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Encapsulated', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Fentanyl', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Heart', 'Heroin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Oxycodone', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Percocet', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Social Impacts', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vicodin', 'Work', 'addiction', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analog', 'base', 'cohort', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'design', 'drug misuse', 'experimental group', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'overdose death', 'prescription drug abuse', 'prescription monitoring program', 'quetiapine', 'social media', 'social observations', 'spelling', 'study characteristics', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,332269,0.1559631131452505
"Social Media Use and Mechanisms of Suicide Risk in Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract Suicide rates have nearly doubled among adolescent girls over the past decade. During this same time period, social media sites (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook) have become ubiquitous, with nearly 97% of youth now using social media. Social media offers both risks and benefits for adolescent development. However, there is likely a vulnerable subset of youth for whom social media use influences suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). The primary goal of this study is to examine how and for whom social media use contributes risk for STBs, so that we may better identify and intervene with youth most at risk. A multi-method approach, integrating computational psychiatry and experimental techniques, will be used to investigate the specific mechanisms by which social media use affects STBs. Data will be collected from both an existing dataset (n ~ 2,000) and a recruited sample (n = 90 adolescent females, ages 14-17, with lifetime history of STBs). To identify specific, directly observable social media experiences that heighten risk for STBs, digital trace data (i.e., social media content and meta-data) will be collected directly from adolescents’ social media pages and analyzed using machine learning techniques. In addition, an innovative laboratory paradigm with eye- tracking/pupillometry will be used to examine cognitive and affective responses to social media use that increase vulnerability to STBs. Participant STBs will be assessed at baseline, 3-month-, and 6-month follow ups. The aims of the study are well-aligned with the candidate’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator of adolescent social media use and mental health. To purse this research agenda going forward, the candidate proposes training in four key areas: (1) machine learning methods for analyzing digital trace data, (2) experimental eye tracking/pupillometry paradigms, (3) mechanism-based translational research in adolescent suicide risk, and (4) professional development, with an emphasis on training in effective interdisciplinary collaboration and the ethics of social media research. A team of mentors and consultants from multiple disciplines will facilitate the candidate’s training, including experts in youth suicide risk, machine learning and natural language processing, and experimental peer interaction paradigms. The diverse resources available at Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital will ensure successful completion of the project and foster the development of the candidate’s research program. The proposed study has the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of social media in adolescent suicide risk. Completion of the proposed research and training goals will uniquely position the candidate to become a leader in the field of adolescent social media use. Project Narrative Nearly all adolescents use social media sites, yet for a vulnerable subset of teens, social media use may increase risk for suicide. Given rising suicide rates among adolescent girls in recent years, it is critical to examine the reasons why social media use may be related to suicidal thoughts and attempts.

"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia,9914128,R01MH117172,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disorientation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Psychology', 'Source', 'Stigmatization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital media', 'digital models', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'family burden', 'first episode schizophrenia', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'medical complication', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social observations', 'stem', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'volunteer', 'willingness', 'young adult']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,640014,0.23301017612557146
"Using Machine Learning to Detect and Characterize Synthetic Psychoactive Drug Digital Marketing and Distribution The study will address a critical challenge regarding the public health threat of synthetic psychoactive drugs (SPDs): identifying and characterizing how social media is used to market, distribute and sell these products to the public. We will carry out these aims by examining large volumes of data from popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram using an innovative methodology involving machine learning and multidisciplinary data analysis. This research project addresses a key NIDA research objective: “research on factors which influence initiation, continuation and desistance of use of specific SPDs in different populations. Examples include:…market and distribution factors; policies; and the role of peer influences, social media and the internet.” We will first collect large volumes of data filtered for SPD drug diversion, marketing, and drug dealing via social media posts, comments, and other messages. We will then code the data using an advanced machine learning protocol. Finally, we will analyze the data using statistical, geospatial and network analysis to assess associations between SPD marketing and specific risk factors for user groups. We will accomplish these objectives using a multidisciplinary approach that involves disciplines and methods from public health-epidemiology, substance abuse research, computation science, legal and policy analysis, and geospatial analysis. The project has the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Conduct digital surveillance of popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram in order to  describe the nature and magnitude of online marketing, sale and distribution of SPDs;  Aim 2: Characterize the types of marketing strategies used by SPD vendors and drug dealers on these  platforms, including marketing messages used to influence knowledge, attitudes and perceptions  pertaining to SPDs and identification of the users and networks they target;  Aim 3: Using statistical, network and geospatial methods, describe, test, and visualize associations  between SPD marketing and distribution and specific risk factors and user groups. This is a critical opportunity to better understand how social media contributes to a growing “digital” risk environment that can influence user initiation and enable illegal access to SPDs. Though research examining the linkages between social media and substance abuse has been growing, no study has specifically examined online marketing and access characteristics on more than one platform while at the same time assessing how geographic and user network factors can impact this unique and largely unregulated risk environment. Results from this study can generate further study hypotheses on the association between SPD behavioral risk factors and SPD product trends, while also informing future interventions utilizing e-health tools including targeted regulation, health education, and counter-marketing. The emergence of the public health threat of synthetic cannabinoids and other new synthetic psychoactive substances (SPDs) is coinciding with an increase in the use of the Internet and social media to promote substance abuse behavior and illicit access. In response, the proposed project will leverage advanced methods in “big data” analysis to identify and characterize marketing and distribution of SPDs by conducting surveillance of SPD content and messages on Twitter and Instagram. This will be accomplished using an innovative methodology involving advanced machine learning, statistical, geospatial and network analysis.",Using Machine Learning to Detect and Characterize Synthetic Psychoactive Drug Digital Marketing and Distribution,9951970,R21DA050689,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communications Media', 'Computational Science', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fentanyl', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health education', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Policy Analysis', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Vendor', 'Youth', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'eHealth', 'experience', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient advocacy group', 'peer influence', 'prescription drug abuse', 'response', 'service providers', 'social media', 'study population', 'synthetic cannabinoid', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2020,236250,0.24658671168142213
"UTILIZING TWITTER TO IDENTIFY AND RECRUIT YOUNG BLACK MEN AT HIGH RISK OF HIV INFECTION Project Summary  The disproportionate incidence of HIV/AIDS among Black men underscores a dire need for technologically innovative and culturally-responsive approaches to reduce HIV in Black communities. There is evidence that social media platforms such as Twitter may offer an unprecedented opportunity to identify and recruit young Black men (YBM) at elevated risk, but to date there is a dearth of empirical evidence to support that social media based-recruitment using natural language processing is feasible and/or acceptable. On social media platforms like Twitter, young men share substance and sex related content. We propose mining these Twitter posts to identify YBM who may be at risk of elevated HIV, based on their substance and sexual risk posts. This study will serve as a proof of method to test the extent to which we can identify and recruit YBM based on their social media posts. We will extend and calibrate our “High-Risk Language” (HRL) algorithm to identify users who post HIV-risk related language on Twitter. Those who agree to participate and deemed eligible will complete a qualitative interview and in- person study visit which includes HIV testing, multi-drug screening, and a survey of their sexual risk and substance use behaviors. Our primary outcomes are; (1) condomless (and/or without PrEP) vaginal or anal sex and (2) illicit drug use before or during sex. We will assess the yield and accuracy of our HRL algorithm at identifying YBM at risk, compared to their biomarkers and surveys. This work will test cutting-edge research tools aimed at increasing the rigor and precision of online recruitment efforts to reduce HIV in the Black community. Project Narrative HIV prevention and care strategies require a synergistic approach to fight HIV in the Black community. The proposed project aims to test an innovative identification and recruitment method using social media to target young black men at elevated risk for HIV infection.",UTILIZING TWITTER TO IDENTIFY AND RECRUIT YOUNG BLACK MEN AT HIGH RISK OF HIV INFECTION,10214087,R21DA049572,"['AIDS prevention', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anal Sex', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioethics', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Science', 'Drug Screening', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'HIV/STD', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Prevention', 'Privatization', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sex Behavior', 'Social support', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Twitter', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vagina', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cisgender', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'eligible participant', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'high risk men', 'illicit drug use', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'prevention service', 'primary outcome', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'residence', 'screening', 'sex', 'sexual minority', 'social media', 'substance use prevention', 'tool', 'web site', 'young adult', 'young man']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2020,247500,0.06347130221247639
"Social Media Mining for Pharmacovigilance Project Summary Drugs undergo extensive testing in animals and clinical trials in humans before they are marketed for widespread use. Pre-market testing produces reasonably high quality information about the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the condition for which it was approved, but gives a very incomplete picture of the drug's safety. It is only after a drug is marketed and used on a more widespread basis over longer periods of time that it is possible to identify other effects, such as rare but serious adverse effects, or those that are more common in the special subgroups excluded from the trial (such as pregnant women), or effects of long-term use of the drug, among others. Despite the increase in research in the past years exploring social media data for pharmacovigilance, and the evidence that it indeed can bring forward the patient perspective, there is no systematic approach to collect and annotate such data for research purposes. This renewal builds on our prior research and natural language processing (NLP) methods for social media mining in pharmacovigilance to make the collection of social media data about medication use precise and systematic enough to be useful to researchers and the public, alongside established sources such as the FDA's data and other public collections of drug adverse event data. It presents innovative methods to automatically collect and analyze longitudinal health data, piloting methods for interventions through the same media that can inform the public and help validate the automatic methods. As validation, we include a comparison to an existing reference standard for adverse effects that integrates FDA's data and HER data, as well as specific case studies focused on (Aim 3.1) the use of NSAIDs and anti-depressants in pregnancy and (Aim 3.2) factors for non-adherence.

"HIV Prevention and Care Project Summary I propose to implement an innovative mixed methods study using machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling in combination with advanced social network analysis to provide valuable information about the online communicative and social contexts that contribute to HIV prevention and care engagement among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The study aims to answer the following questions: (1) How are the semantic features of social media communication (i.e., key terms and concepts) among YBMSM related to their HIV prevention and care engagement?; (2) How are structural features of observed social media relationships among YBMSM related to their prevention and care engagement?; and (3) Can social media use patterns predict future prevention and care engagement? To pursue these questions, I will draw on data collected March 2016-March 2019 from YBMSM participants in an ongoing network HIV prevention intervention (N=423). Prevention and care engagement behaviors include retention in care (HIV/PrEP/Primary), STI/HIV testing, and condom use. Participant social media data include: (1) Facebook posts, (2) Facebook friendships, and (3) Facebook group memberships. K99 Phase: Research conducted during the K99 Phase will use machine learning techniques for textual analysis, semantic network characterization, and regression models to identify the semantic features of participants' communication and their association with HIV prevention and care engagement. I will receive mentored training in 5 key areas: (1) knowledge of issues relevant to HIV prevention, care and treatment for MSM; (2) machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling; (3) advanced stochastic network modeling, including exponential random graph models (ERGMs); and (4) design and implementation of social media based interventions for health promotion; and (5) professional development. R00 Phase: For the R00 I will employ one-mode and two- mode ERGMs to determine how prevention and care engagement behaviors affect the structure of observed social media relationships. I will then develop a predictive model for prevention and care engagement on the basis of individuals' social media use patterns. This K99/R00 award mechanism will be critical to my success in achieving long-term success as an expert in the social and communicative dynamics of HIV prevention and care engagement in high-risk populations. It will also pave the way to an R01 application – based on a longitudinal design – of YMSMs' social and communication engagement in a more diverse array of online social networking sites, including both general purpose and dating platforms. The goal of this project will be to utilize that information to establish classes of YMSM on the basis of their heterogeneous patterns of social media use to better understand their synergistic effects on HIV prevention and care engagement practices over time. This is an important next step in understanding how online social environments impact prevention engagement and will help identify causal relationships that may be amenable to network intervention. Project Narrative This proposal is an innovative mix methods design that utilizes machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling in combination with advanced social network analysis to provide valuable information about the online communicative and social contexts that contribute to HIV prevention and care engagement among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The proposed research will sharpen our understanding of the degree to which online social environments support protective or risky behavioral norms and, consequently the degree to which they reveal viable points for intervention. It will also demonstrate how social media data can help front-line staff profile clients in near real-time and predict future HIV-related outcomes like retention failure, thereby serving as an indicator to guide decisions on screening, treatment, and other service provisions.",HIV Prevention and Care,10253483,R00HD094648,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Facebook', 'Failure', 'Friends', 'Friendships', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Group Affiliation', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'HIV/STD', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterosexuals', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Service provision', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Site', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Network', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'black men who have sex with men', 'cohort', 'condoms', 'design', 'digital', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal design', 'meetings', 'men who have sex with men', 'network models', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer networks', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'predictive modeling', 'protective behavior', 'response', 'screening', 'sexual health intervention', 'social', 'social communication', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'socialization behavior', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'willingness', 'young adult', 'young men who have sex with men']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R00,2020,248752,0.19202059313035075
"Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention Project Summary Clinical or subclinical eating disorders (EDs) impact 10% of individuals in their lifetime and are marked by significant functional impairment, early mortality, chronicity, and emotional distress. ED symptoms often emerge in adolescence, with peak onset age in the teenage years. Early recognition and treatment of these devastating illnesses are needed to prevent long-term consequences and a chronic course. Most (80%) individuals with EDs, including teens with EDs (TwEDs), do not receive treatment. Due to major barriers to access and to the delivery of treatment for TwEDs, there is a need for a new model of service delivery that can identify and help TwEDs. We have studied ED-related networking on social media and have demonstrated our ability to harness social media, which is used ubiquitously among teens, to identify and efficiently recruit large numbers of TwEDs. At the same time, our team has successfully developed a guided self-help cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app, StudentBodies-Eating Disorders (SB-ED), which includes personalized coaching and interactive sessions to address key ED treatment targets and has demonstrated efficacy among college women with EDs. This tool has great potential to be adapted to address the specific needs of TwEDs. In Aim #1 of the proposed study, we will update and adapt SB-ED to create #ByeED for TwEDs by 1) simplifying language and making content relevant to adolescent issues, 2) including a rewards feature to motivate continued app use, 3) including a within-app social networking feature to facilitate group exchanges and coach-led weekly group sessions, and 4) harnessing machine learning to digest users’ social networking data within #ByeED to respond to potential recovery setbacks in real-time and tailor coaching interactions. Following a small focus group of TwEDs to assess initial impressions of the app, #ByeED will be piloted among 20 TwEDs recruited from Instagram, garnering feedback via a mixed methods approach on the efficiency, technical effectiveness, and satisfaction with #ByeED. The app will be further refined for a small pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Aim #2, where we will again leverage Instagram for recruitment of TwEDs who are not engaged in treatment. This RCT will approximate the preliminary effectiveness of #ByeED (n=50) versus a control group (encouraging in-person treatment in their communities, n=50) in reducing ED symptoms, improving quality of life, increasing uptake of care, and impacting targets that are associated with outcomes. We will explore within-app predictors of outcomes, potential moderators of treatment effects (e.g., psychiatric comorbidity), and participant perspectives on potential additional parental involvement in #ByeED. Effect size and attrition estimates will aid in the planning of a larger RCT (R01 mechanism) where we will further expand #ByeED (e.g., automated coaching, parental involvement) and test the app on a larger scale to improve its potential to reduce the extraordinary burden of EDs among teens. Relevance to Public Health Eating disorders often emerge in adolescence and most of these teens do not receive treatment. We will use social media to reach teens networking about eating disorder behaviors and test a mobile app specifically developed for teens, including a social networking component, to help reduce eating disorder symptoms and improve their quality of life. We will also obtain teen perspectives on acceptable approaches to include parents in this intervention to inform a future version of the app.",Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention,9908180,R34MH119170,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Anxiety', 'Body Image', 'Body Weight', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Eating Disorders', 'Effectiveness', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Service delivery model', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavior test', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'emotional distress', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'outreach', 'parental involvement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'restraint', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'self help', 'service delivery', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'uptake']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R34,2020,232191,0.13145320641061142
"Mining Social Media Messages for HIV Testing and Prevention Communication PROJECT SUMMARY With the advent of Big Data methods, social media is the proverbial low-hanging fruit to disseminate HIV prevention and testing messages on a large scale 1,2. These media already transmit messages on condom use, HIV testing, and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), from government institutions, NGOs, private citizens, and community groups, but it does so in an informal way. This real-time repository of real-world health messages, along with our ability to mine and pinpoint counties that need to engage in a conversation about HIV prevention and testing, offers a unique opportunity to develop Big Data methods for geographically targeted message dissemination. Despite some interventions designed for online delivery 3–19, the overall potential of social media and their most promising contents (e.g., actionable messages with behavioral instructions) have surprisingly not been established to date. Our project will focus on the disease-burdened population of Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM), and will develop a highly significant computing infrastructure (Aim 1) to automatically and continuously input social media postings from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, behavioral data from the American Men Internet Survey (AMIS), and HIV prevalence data from AIDSVu.org, and using that triangulation, to target counties that need social media messages about condom use, HIV testing, and/or PrEP for MSM. Using machine learning methods, the same platform will then select actionable and acceptable messages to fill county gaps. Once the platform has been refined with input from research participants who are employees of health departments, it will be used to send experimental messages (Aim 2), selected to match county needs, and to be actionable and acceptable to a group of health departments randomized to the experimental condition. The success of the experimental messages will be gauged by the hallmarks of social media, repostings, Likes, Dislike, and comment favorability, compared with the success of a random selection of HIV-relevant messages sent to a different group of health departments randomized to the control condition. The project is innovative in several ways. First, the social media messages will involve diverse inputs (text, images, videos) never before brought together in this area. Second, we are not aware of the prior use of the proposed triangulation involving epidemiological, behavioral, and social media data. Third, a method of mining naturally accruing messages will be new and transformative, allowing for the generation of “live” campaigns with messages selected that remain current, sustainable, and community-based by design. Further, the use of an implementation-science experiment at a large, geographically distributed, scale is highly novel. These research aims are facilitated by unique team expertise about communication and persuasion, Big Data methods, public health, and Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling, and leading institutions in the areas of psychology, public health, and computer science.

"Quantifying Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users on Social Media 2/12/2019 ProjectSummary - Google Docs Project Summary I will leverage social media conversations, specifically Reddit, to examine treatment help-seeking at an unprecedented scale, thereby collecting evidence “in the wild” as a new strategy to monitor and respond to the opioid crisis through the following aims. Aim 1. Data Driven Characterization of Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users: I will systematically identify Reddit posts about opioids, identify if the post is help-seeking for treatment, and contextualize the content of help-seeking posts. Aim 2. Data Driven Characterization of Lay Responses to Help-Seeking from Self-Identified Opioid Users: I aim to understand how peers organically respond to help-seeking for treatment by building data-driven models to discern what attributes of posts are predictive of receiving a response from a peer and to examine the typical content and reciprocity of responses. Aim 3. Assess the Quality of Lay Responses to Help-Seeking from Self-Identified Opioid Users: I aim to identify the types of treatment, treatment services, and treatment referral services that are provided in the responses and assess the quality of lay responses to opioid treatment help-seeking. Currently, little is known about how drug users engage social media to support or combat their addictions. Reddit is the sixth most popular website in the US with many reporters noting that it may be the last lifeline for opioid users. Yet, little has been done to tap this potential source for social media monitoring, especially given the difficulty of finding self-identified opioid users who are already contemplating strategies to treat their addiction. This study adds a new significant perspective to social media monitoring and will be among the first in public health to consider social media conversation threads by assessing unique posts about opioid help-seeking, the responses these posts get, and the quality of responses to addiction help-seeking, thereby creating a knowledge base for public health leaders to respond. Success of these aims will generate a number of future research directions that will support interventions that address the needs of self-identified opioid users seeking help on Reddit. Moreover, within all three aims this study will bring significant methodological advances to the study of social media around substance use with the aims relying heavily on automated approaches and analysis first developed in the computational sciences engendering more data scientists to join public health to create actionable knowledge. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z4XHd63xhPZT8OFf9bHQ2q6XHpYp_c4AbouAOtAC3SU/edit 1/1 2/12/2019 ProjectNarrative - Google Docs Project Narrative An explosion of surveillance tools fueled by big media data (including social media) is changing public health. These data reveal what a person is thinking/doing and when they are thinking/doing it based on the content and timing of their public posts, providing an assessment of organic help-seeking for addiction and peer-to-peer knowledge sharing that was never before possible. I will extract actionable intelligence from social media data, specifically Reddit, to support more agile, responsive opioid intervention research by studying (a) treatment help-seeking of self-identified opioid users, (b) lay responses to help-seeking of self-identified opioid users, and (c) whether lay peers link self-identified opioid users to evidence-based treatment, treatment services, or treatment referral services. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RyIXTdDAbFSkCe81q6hThDiZzKGCXkCy8npWgzr5wfM/edit 1/1",Quantifying Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users on Social Media,9872029,K25DA049944,"['Address', 'Advertisements', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Code', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Drug user', 'Educational Background', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Hotlines', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Opioid', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Public Assistance', 'Public Health', 'RQ2', 'Recovery', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Social intelligence', 'Source', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'combat', 'dissemination trial', 'evidence base', 'help-seeking behavior', 'illicit opioid', 'knowledge base', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'opioid user', 'opioid withdrawal', 'peer', 'phrases', 'posters', 'prescription opioid', 'public health intervention', 'referral services', 'research study', 'response', 'social media', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K25,2020,189498,0.16902547135702156
"Characterization of Misinformation Dynamics in COVID-19 related health information in online social media Abstract: Social media has become predominant as a source of information for many health care consumers. However false and misleading information are a pervasive problem in this context. Specifically, during CVID-19 pandemic, misinformation has been a significant public health challenge, impeding the effectiveness of public health awareness campaigns and resulting in suboptimal responsiveness to the communication of legitimate risk- related information. In the proposed research, we will apply our “Pragmatics to Reveal Intent in Social Media (PRISM) framework to facilitate automated detection of intent and belief attributes underlying COVID-19 related misinformation. The PRISM framework aims to incorporate and integrate communication intent, semantics and structure of online communication to study social processes and cognitive factors underlying misinformation comprehension. Such analysis forms the foundational step towards characterization of misinformation seeding and perception in digital social settings, ultimately allowing us to develop scalable and reliable computational infrastructure that can help formulate resilient and effective dissemination approaches to negotiate misinformation spread, easing public health burden and informing policy regulations as needed. Project Narrative: This project enables retrospective analysis of social intercourse to facilitate our understanding of the associations between communication (content, intent, structure), cognitive biases, and social influence dynamics underlying COVID-19 related online interactions as manifested in social media. As a component of the proposed research, we will integrate methods of discourse analysis, automated text analysis, and dynamic network models to analyze electronically captured peer-to-peer communication and characterize individual intent and belief attributes at scale. By enabling deeper analysis of communication in online platforms, resulting research can help engineer compensation strategies to mitigate misinformation spread.",Characterization of Misinformation Dynamics in COVID-19 related health information in online social media,10176817,R01LM012974,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Belief', 'COVID-19', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Models', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discourse analysis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Mediation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Developments', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Social Distance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Processes', 'Social isolation', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'behavior change', 'computer infrastructure', 'contagion', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'health assessment', 'health belief', 'network models', 'pandemic disease', 'peer', 'peer support', 'public education', 'scale up', 'social', 'social inclusion', 'social media', 'social situation']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2020,63106,0.15732124013880663
"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. This application requests 5 years of funding to support protected research time for Dr. Cavazos to learn and apply new skills in state-of-the-art “big data” analysis and to synthesize her results across studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media.",Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight ,10002211,K02DA043657,"['ATOD', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Advertisements', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Latina', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Media Campaign', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Survey Methodology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Twitter', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wages', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'adolescent substance use', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career development', 'data mining', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'hookah', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'social factors', 'social implication', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'substance misuse', 'tool', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2020,118137,0.29953144829061046
