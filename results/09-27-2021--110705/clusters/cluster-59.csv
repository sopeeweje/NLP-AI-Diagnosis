"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9693300,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'EEG-based imaging', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'automated analysis', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,676659,0.07527247483254261
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9619075,R01DC014498,"['Academic achievement', 'Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American Sign Language', 'Articulation', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Emotions', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'body position', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'showing emotion', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,318386,0.03973546167104179
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9695211,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,522460,0.06123438517749456
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9701324,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,613809,0.03149418242370056
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome,9885029,R01MH119185,"['22q11.2', '3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Rhinometry', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ear', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nasal cavity', 'Neurobiology', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Cortex', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oral cavity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Societies', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conotruncal anomaly face syndrome', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdeletion', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory sulcus', 'precision medicine', 'psychotic symptoms', 'resilience', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,746845,0.1315386807162101
"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,9660167,R01MH116042,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Boston', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'outpatient programs', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,892010,0.03564485354217916
"Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP) 1. Abstract We propose to create a NIMH P50 ALACRITY Center that develops the collaborations, data systems, and methods necessary to form a state-wide Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research, aka the LEAP Center. While recent trial evidence suggests great promise for coordinated specialty care (CSC) for patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), there remain several gaps in the knowledge base for the care of psychosis in general. Now is an ideal time to address these gaps because of recent policy changes enhancing FEP care financing, practice changes in the field, and methods developed outside of mental health. To create this Center, we will start with interdisciplinary collaborations between CSC clinics in Massachusetts, policy makers/regulators, and stakeholders, and include FEP experts from across the country plus scientific experts from outside of mental health, e.g., in data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and health policy. We also will leverage recent Massachusetts efforts to mandate, standardized, and support data collection on FEP care structures, delivery, and outcomes from all FEP clinics within the state. We also will apply and develop modern methods for clinical prediction and comparative effectiveness research (CER), e.g., machine learning and g-methods, for FEP research. Accordingly, we have three overall Center aims: 1) Collaborations; 2) Data systems; and 3) Prediction and CER methods. The Center will start with three foundational and complementary projects: 1) Using the state All Payer Claims Database (APCD), Project 1 will apply a population-level approach to examine which patients receive care in FEP clinics offering CSC versus elsewhere, as the number of clinics increases, then estimate the treatment effect on unfavorable clinical event rates such as hospitalizations; 2) Project 2 will review the data collected by the state from all of the FEP clinics, assess and improve data collection quality, validate measures, and integrate perspectives; and 3) Project 3 will define clusters of patients using longitudinal outcome data (i.e., begin to unpack the amount of clinical heterogeneity), predict the cluster type for individual patients, and examine the impact of CSC treatment accounting for this clinical heterogeneity. The Administrative Core and Methods Core (Prediction and CER) bind these projects together. The Center will include a group of Scientific Advisors from across North America, Center Faculty from diverse scientific disciplines, including those that historically have had little exposure in mental health research, and Stakeholders, including policy makers, organizational decision makers, and patient and family advocates.

This Center will be dedicated to addressing these questions by bringing together leading clinicians and scientists, and creating the systems needed to conduct studies to provide guidance to patients, families, and clinicians in the future.",Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP),9699782,P50MH115846,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adverse effects', 'Advocate', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Community Outreach', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education and Outreach', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Information Systems', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'North America', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'faculty community', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'web site']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,P50,2019,1467963,0.04568426002175723
"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9742524,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'supervised learning', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,659674,0.09441035914319121
"Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Detrimental shifts in the resting (tonic) contributions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to visceral functions throughout the body, a form of compromised allostasis, have been observed with both emotional dysregulation and disordered mood and may be a common, core vulnerability for CVD and metabolic syndrome. A crucial but understudied psychological vulnerability to compromised allostasis is low emotional granularity, or the inability to experience emotion with precision and detail (e.g., the inability to distinguish anger vs. frustration, or even anger vs. sadness). A critical barrier to ameliorating low granularity, and therefore reducing susceptibility to CVD and metabolic syndrome, has been the lack of a theoretical framework linking emotional granularity to physiological regulation, as well as tools for effectively measuring and improving granularity. Theoretical advances in affective science posit that the use of more precise emotion concepts is associated with a peripheral physiological system better able to respond to environmental perturbations (e.g., stressors). If low granularity results from impoverished emotion concepts, then the brain is less able to predict and categorize viscerosensory changes that arise from regulation of the body’s internal milieu. Increased parasympathetic tone at rest permits more efficient regulation by promoting recovery and energy conservation, and substantial evidence suggests that lowered risk profiles for CVD are associated with increased high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV). The proposed research will use experience sampling and ambulatory monitoring data to map variability in emotional granularity in everyday life and examine its consequences for peripheral physiology, with a focus on resting HF HRV. In Aim 1, machine learning will be used to assess whether individuals lower in emotional granularity have less efficient allostasis, as reflected by both lower resting parasympathetic activity and fewer distinct patterns of ANS activity. In Aim 2, graph theory will be used to develop metrics for measuring temporal and contextual dynamics of emotional granularity, which provide meaningful variance necessary to describe patterns of subjective experience and physiological activity. Exploratory Aim 3 will assess whether in-lab emotion concept training can be used to improve granularity of emotion concepts, with the ultimate goal of developing longer-term training aimed at increasing physiological specificity and resting HF HRV. By integrating modeling from engineering and computer science to better capture idiographic variation in emotion, the proposed research offers an innovative approach for understanding how a psychological vulnerability could increase the risk for cardiovascular illness. The outcomes of this work will allow for the development of psychological interventions that can decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE A wide range of emotion-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome have been identified, yet little is known about how the underlying mechanisms that link emotion to physiological regulation of the body can be leveraged to reduce susceptibility. The proposed work addresses this critical barrier by examining how one psychological vulnerability is linked to parasympathetic activation, and can be more effectively measured in patterns of autonomic nervous system activity and subjective experience. By further identifying possible interventions that target this vulnerability, this work seeks to decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms.",Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome,9769513,F31HL140943,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alexithymias', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Anger', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Common Core', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'alcohol risk', 'allostasis', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'coping', 'coping mechanism', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'graph theory', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'stressor', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,38616,0.02920242234390871
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9652845,R01MH112560,"['Affect', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Observer Variation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Social Psychology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'executive function', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'social', 'social deficits', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,474391,0.05844621115320791
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8.

We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9920544,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2019,86955,0.0702960946240178

"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia.

"Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis Project Summary: Brain networks linking the cortex to thalamus are critical for cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning. Dysruption of thalamocortical networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychosis, and mechanisms of clinical phenotypes, especially cognitive impairment. This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks. The availability of several large-scale cross-sectional datasets containing multi-modal neuroimaging data and extensive phenotypic data on healthy and at-risk individuals has created an unprecedented opportunity to address these critical knowledge gaps. They include the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN: n=656, ages 18-88); Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI- RS: n=932, ages 6-85); Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset (PING: N=1239, ages 3-20); Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC: n=1601, ages 8-21), which includes psychosis spectrum (PS) youth; and the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS: n=397). Building on our prior work in clinical populations and leveraging the considerable resources of these datasets, we propose to chart the development of thalamocortical networks in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and youth with PS symptoms (Aim 2), characterize the associations between thalamocortical biomarkers and cognition (Aim 3), and investigate the clinical utility of thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers at identifying atypical brain development in individual subjects across the psychosis continuum and predicting conversion to psychosis in clinical high risk individuals (Aim 4). The proposed Aims will: 1) establish critical normative lifespan development data for refining and testing etiological models of not just psychosis, but other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as aging- related disorders; 2) inform the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders and contribute to dimensional models of psychosis; 3) help define the neural basis of executive cognitive abilities thereby providing the necessary foundation for mechanistic models of normal cognitive function and cognitive impairment in psychosis; and 4) potentially provide risk biomarkers and intervention targets for youth at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Public Health Relevance: Many psychiatric disorders emerge between childhood and early adulthood, a period when the brain is undergoing significant developmental changes, and are associated with cognitive impairment which leads to lifelong limitations in psychosocial functioning. Determining how and when premorbid brain development goes awry, clarifying the neural basis of cognitive impairment, and establishing the clinical utility of brain-based biomarkers at predicting illness onset in individuals at high risk for neuropsychiatric illness are essential to developing targeted interventions that prevent the onset of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.",Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis,9710707,R01MH115000,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'symptomatology', 'young adult']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,369864,0.05872968722322455
"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.  Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and present treatment only works for a limited number of patients. In order to identify new therapeutic targets, we will longitudinally characterize the underlying pathologies in those with poor treatment response using complimentary brain imaging modalities.",Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients,9682509,R01MH113800,"['Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine Antagonists', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Protons', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Risperidone', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'aripiprazole', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain abnormalities', 'cingulate cortex', 'drug development', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'longitudinal design', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'new therapeutic target', 'patient subsets', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2019,743707,0.0727002966903807
"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,9675331,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'childhood adversity', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,569073,0.07110931109487927
"Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues. People signal their internal emotional state by a range of cues including facial expressions, non-verbal vocalizations and the tone and content of speech. Much work to date on emotional signaling has focused on a small number of emotions and has relied on stimulus sets with limited numbers of exemplars and poor representation of individuals of different ages and ethnicities. The computer vision literature has long recognized the need to be able to compare models, for example of face recognition, across complex, diverse, and naturalistic stimulus sets. Here, we argue that a parallel approach needs to be applied if we are to achieve a robust and generalizable understanding of how the human brain represents emotion and identity related information derived from facial and vocal cues. Three multi-session functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments are proposed. In the first, participants will view a large corpus (~2000) of faces of individuals varying in age, gender and ethnicity and showing a wide range of emotional expressions. In the second, participants will be presented with a large (~1000) and equally diverse set of emotional vocalizations. The third experiment will make use of an even more complex and naturalistic stimulus set comprising ~1000 video clips of individuals expressing emotions through facial expression, non-verbal vocalizations and emotion-laden speech. This set will be broken into three parts, with as closely matched content as possible. These will be presented to participants in audio only, visual only and audio-visual (bimodal) conditions, with the stimuli allocated to each condition balanced across participants. For each experiment, data collection will comprise separate Model Estimation and Model Validation periods with the majority of stimuli presented at Validation being distinct from those presented at Estimation. A range of models will be fit to the fMRI data acquired during Estimation runs and tested and compared using data acquired during Validation runs. These models contain sets of features that describe the emotional content of the stimuli presented in terms of either dimensional or categorical models of emotion. By comparing the fit of these models we can determine which models capture most variance in voxel response profiles and examine how this varies across brain regions. Across the three experiments, we also seek to establish whether there are regions where voxels show common coding of emotional state regardless of whether information is carried by facial or vocal cues or a combination of both. Further, by contrasting models with and without terms for characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity we can also investigate the (in)dependence of the representation of emotion and identity-related features. The proposed research has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of how cues to others' emotional state are represented in the human brain and the extent to which this is influenced by the characteristics of the person we are interacting with. In the medium term, we plan to extend this to also model listener/ viewer characteristics (both demographics and predisposition to anxiety or depression) in a hope to advance our understanding of how biases in the interpretation of emotional signals can arise. Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial  and vocal cues. Individuals with psychiatric conditions ranging from Social Anxiety and Depression to Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia struggle to correctly interpret others' emotional states. To understand how alterations in brain function can give rise to the misperception of emotion cues, we first need better normative models of how information about others' emotional state derived from facial and vocal cues is represented within the human brain. Hence, here we use large, diverse and naturalistic stimulus sets encompassing facial expressions, emotional vocalizations and multi-modal videos to investigate the extent to which consistent representation of emotional state is observed across stimulus modalities, and to explore the organizational principles that can best explain voxel response profiles or tuning patterns to facial and vocal emotion cues.",Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues,9731295,R01MH112541,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Literature', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Research', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'data acquisition', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'information model', 'multimodality', 'neural model', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social anxiety', 'theories', 'trait', 'visual information', 'visual neuroscience', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,125000,0.09672289603405068
"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,9935464,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,823331,0.05413333448880711
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis,9676982,K23MH116130,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Israel', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'computational basis', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'economic cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal course', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'responsible research conduct', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'smart watch', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIMH,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2019,190676,0.04183751448932532
"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9481191,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'EEG-based imaging', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,616434,0.07527247483254261
"Craniofacial Microsmia: Facial Expression from Ages 1 to 3 Years Project Summary Significance. Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development. Children with CFM have elevated levels of internalizing behavior (shy, withdrawn) and reduced social competence and peer acceptance. Unknown at present are the mechanisms through which CFM and these social-emotional outcomes become linked. Facial asymmetries and cranial neuropathies associated with CFM likely play an important role in impairing socio-emotional outcomes. Asymmetries of the facial skeleton, soft tissue, and cranial nerve have both intra- and interpersonal effects. Intra-personally, they impact function (unilateral hearing loss, malocclusion, facial expressiveness) and form (noticeable craniofacial malformations), which can impair social signaling and responsiveness. Because asymmetry is negatively correlated with attractiveness, there may be non-specific social effects as well. Many surgical treatments for CFM are designed to restore facial symmetry in static pose (e.g., neutral expression). Less is known about restoring or even measuring spontaneous facial expressiveness. From a developmental perspective, one of the most important consequences of limitations in facial muscle movement is its potentially negative impact on affective communication. In a longitudinal design, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry increase risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, the findings would inform our understanding of socio-emotional development in children with CFM and contribute to clinical evaluation and treatment. Innovation. This is the first effort to 1) use automated, objective measurement of facial expressiveness of communicative behavior and functional asymmetry of children with CFM; 2) model change with development in these parameters and their relation to internalizing and externalizing problems; and 3) use machine learning to investigate the relation among dynamics of expressiveness and asymmetry in relation to CBCL. Approach. Children with and without CFM will be video-recorded at 1 and 3 years with an examiner. Age 1 is an interactive context intended to elicit positive and negative emotion. Age 3 is an interactive context to assess expressive speech and attention. Expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry are assessed using automatic, objective computer-vision based measurement. Analyses include complementary approaches: statistical (regression and ANOVA) hypothesis testing and machine learning (convolutional neural networks). Relevance Using objective, automatic computer-vision-based measurements, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry among children with CFM increases their risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, clinical assessments of expressiveness and functional asymmetry could effectively target children for specialized interventions and be used to evaluate surgical interventions. Because the proposed procedures are cost effective, they could be applied in a wide range of settings to benefit children with craniofacial disorders and have applicability to other conditions and age groups in which facial expression is compromised (e.g., Mobius Syndrome, Bell's Palsy, injury/burns, and stroke). Project Narrative Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) is among the most common craniofacial anomalies. CFM impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development. Using computer-vision based face analysis, statistical analysis (regression and ANOVA), and machine learning, we will investigate the relation among expressiveness, structural and functional asymmetry, and behavior problems in children with CFM.",Craniofacial Microsmia: Facial Expression from Ages 1 to 3 Years,9525940,R03DE026513,"['1 year old', '3 year old', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Articulation', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bell Palsy', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Burn injury', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Cranial nerve diseases', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Facial asymmetry', 'Funding', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malocclusion', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mobius Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Problem behavior', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeleton', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unilateral Hearing Loss', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'age group', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cost effective', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial disorder', 'craniofacial microsomia', 'design', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'malformation', 'outcome prediction', 'parent grant', 'peer', 'procedure cost', 'research clinical testing', 'social', 'social skills', 'soft tissue']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R03,2018,154777,0.05662428722105775
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9486921,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,549838,0.06123438517749456
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9402599,R01DC014498,"['Academic achievement', 'Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American Sign Language', 'Articulation', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Emotions', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'body position', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deafness', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'showing emotion', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,318898,0.03973546167104179
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9534747,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,663541,0.03149418242370056
"Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY During adolescence, the human brain undergoes marked structural and functional refinements to support rapid cognitive and behavioral development. However, the relationship between developing white matter architecture and emergent functional connectivity remains poorly understood. It is imperative to elucidate developmental mechanisms underlying structure-function coupling in youth, as devastating mental disorders such as psychosis have been linked to the disruption of evolving brain connectivity during this epoch. Specifically, psychosis has been characterized by the anomalous functional integration of brain processes. This could result from the aberrant wiring of white matter connections during brain development, from aberrant processes of functional plasticity (activity-dependent myelination of axons linking neurons within functionally-relevant circuits), or both. This proposal will apply cutting-edge network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal neuroimaging and rich clinical phenotyping data acquired as a part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n=503, ages 9-25 years old), a large community-based study of brain development. Moreover, the goal of this proposal is to (1) systematically characterize whether structural connectivity drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within brain modules, or vice versa, and (2) identify abnormalities of structure-function coupling associated with the longitudinal burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. This work will test the overarching hypothesis that structural connectivity precedes and drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within distinct brain modules, and further, that the aberrant development of structure-function coupling will be associated with increased burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide critical new insights regarding both typical brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental etiology of psychosis. Notably, as diverse types of psychopathology are increasingly linked to atypical brain maturation, findings generated by this study could lead to earlier diagnosis and enhanced treatment for individuals at risk for developing mental disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE It remains largely unknown how human white matter connectivity develops during adolescence to support brain function, and how abnormalities of structure-function coupling during this critical period may presage major psychiatric illnesses such as psychosis. By applying sophisticated network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal diffusion and functional neuroimaging data (n=503, ages 9-25 years), this study will provide important new insights regarding both healthy brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of psychosis. The findings generated by this study may allow for the development of earlier and more effective treatments for psychosis, which would benefit public health by reducing the great disability and cost associated with psychosis in youth.",Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis,9610925,F31MH115709,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'cost', 'critical period', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'functional plasticity', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'myelination', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2018,44524,0.07372217376052743
"Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought to cause or exacerbate social disability in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by preventing 1) accurate detection of social/emotional information conveyed through the face, particularly the eye-region, and 2) the deployment of emotionally appropriate responses. Although the neural systems thought to underlie FER deficits in ASD are increasingly appreciated, their plasticity remains speculative. The goal of this project is to develop an assistive technology to promote facial emotion recognition in ASD [R21]. We propose that FER can be rehabilitated using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device [R33]. To develop an FER assistant, we plan to first [R21] determine whether it is possible to develop a multi-voxel classifier that is temporally predictive of successful emotion recognition during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) paradigm will interpret the output of a subject's brain to assess whether a computer-generated actor's emotion is recognized. If not, the expressed facial emotion will be increased in intensity until the computer determines that the subject has recognized the emotion. After tuning this supervised learning algorithm produced by a support vector machine (SVM), we then transform the massively multidimensional classifier to low-dimensionality space, which can be replicated by a single- or dual-EEG sensor placed on the scalp. The proof of principle is that the multivariate classifier can be forward transformed into frequency (EEG) space. The EEG sensor can be comfortably worn outside of the scanner (BCI device), and can be wirelessly linked to a portable tablet (iPad). We will then demonstrate the feasibility of an ambulatory BCI 'FER assistant' [R33] in a between-group, randomized design (genuine neurofeedback vs placebo neurofeedback). The FER assistant is a virtual reality- based iPad application that uses the EEG sensor data to assist users with emotion recognition by manipulating the avatar's emotion intensity until it is recognized by the user, who will receive points the earlier the emotion is recognized. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess feasibility including acceptability of the intervention, recruitment and randomization procedures, intervention implementation, blinded assessment procedures, and participant retention within the context of an RCT in preparation for a well- powered efficacy trial. This study's products include demonstration of the neural processes that underlie FER deficits and evidence of their plasticity, and an easily exportable, minimal-cost computer-based intervention. There has been little treatment research for this under-studied population, and social deficits may post unique challenges to people with ASD during late adolescence and early adulthood, as they face multiple life transitions and developmental tasks requiring social competence (e.g., securing employment). Ultimately, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of this emergent intervention in an adequately powered randomized clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The social disability that characterizes Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pervades other areas of adaptive behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions for adults with ASD to target social disability. We propose to first establish the neural plasticity of specific brain mechanisms underlying difficultis with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability, and subsequently develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time feedback to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.",Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism,9442821,R33MH100268,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Employment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'active method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'computer generated', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'emerging adult', 'innovation', 'neurofeedback', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'participant retention', 'portability', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'study population', 'tool', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R33,2018,237842,0.05754124232892357
"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9567622,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,659674,0.09441035914319121
"Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Detrimental shifts in the resting (tonic) contributions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to visceral functions throughout the body, a form of compromised allostasis, have been observed with both emotional dysregulation and disordered mood and may be a common, core vulnerability for CVD and metabolic syndrome. A crucial but understudied psychological vulnerability to compromised allostasis is low emotional granularity, or the inability to experience emotion with precision and detail (e.g., the inability to distinguish anger vs. frustration, or even anger vs. sadness). A critical barrier to ameliorating low granularity, and therefore reducing susceptibility to CVD and metabolic syndrome, has been the lack of a theoretical framework linking emotional granularity to physiological regulation, as well as tools for effectively measuring and improving granularity. Theoretical advances in affective science posit that the use of more precise emotion concepts is associated with a peripheral physiological system better able to respond to environmental perturbations (e.g., stressors). If low granularity results from impoverished emotion concepts, then the brain is less able to predict and categorize viscerosensory changes that arise from regulation of the body’s internal milieu. Increased parasympathetic tone at rest permits more efficient regulation by promoting recovery and energy conservation, and substantial evidence suggests that lowered risk profiles for CVD are associated with increased high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV). The proposed research will use experience sampling and ambulatory monitoring data to map variability in emotional granularity in everyday life and examine its consequences for peripheral physiology, with a focus on resting HF HRV. In Aim 1, machine learning will be used to assess whether individuals lower in emotional granularity have less efficient allostasis, as reflected by both lower resting parasympathetic activity and fewer distinct patterns of ANS activity. In Aim 2, graph theory will be used to develop metrics for measuring temporal and contextual dynamics of emotional granularity, which provide meaningful variance necessary to describe patterns of subjective experience and physiological activity. Exploratory Aim 3 will assess whether in-lab emotion concept training can be used to improve granularity of emotion concepts, with the ultimate goal of developing longer-term training aimed at increasing physiological specificity and resting HF HRV. By integrating modeling from engineering and computer science to better capture idiographic variation in emotion, the proposed research offers an innovative approach for understanding how a psychological vulnerability could increase the risk for cardiovascular illness. The outcomes of this work will allow for the development of psychological interventions that can decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE A wide range of emotion-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome have been identified, yet little is known about how the underlying mechanisms that link emotion to physiological regulation of the body can be leveraged to reduce susceptibility. The proposed work addresses this critical barrier by examining how one psychological vulnerability is linked to parasympathetic activation, and can be more effectively measured in patterns of autonomic nervous system activity and subjective experience. By further identifying possible interventions that target this vulnerability, this work seeks to decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms.",Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome,9470193,F31HL140943,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alexithymias', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Anger', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Common Core', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'alcohol risk', 'allostasis', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'coping', 'coping mechanism', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'graph theory', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'stressor', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,38124,0.02920242234390871
"Emotion Processing, Cognition and Functioning in Comorbid Psychosis Spectrum and Cocaine Use Disorders NIDA's strategic planning emphasizes the need to increase the real-world relevance of research by prioritizing “research that incorporates real-world complexities including common comorbidities” that “interact to affect symptom profiles, illness trajectory, and treatment outcomes”.  The overall goal of the current application is to characterize the impact of the common comorbidity between psychosis spectrum disorders (PSD, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder) and cocaine use disorders (CUD) on cognition, emotion processing and functional outcomes. Clinical and sociodemographic correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD, and pathways to functional outcomes in comorbid PSD+CUD will also be explored.  To do this, three existing datasets will be used, with comprehensive diagnostic, clinical, cognitive and functional data, including patients with comorbid PSD and CUD (PSD+CUD), and 3 comparison groups: patients with PSD without CUD, patients with CUD without PSD, and healthy controls without psychiatric disorder. This unique design, including all 3 relevant control groups, will allow to elucidate the combined effect of comorbid PSD+CUD, compared to the effect of PSD or CUD alone, on cognition and emotion processing, and test two alternate models: an additive model and a self- medication model. The present study will focus on 3 specific aims: 1) To characterize sociodemographic and clinical correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD; 2) To characterize cognitive and emotion processing impairments in comorbid PSD+CUD; 3) To characterize functional impairments in comorbid PSD+CUD, and to identify predictors and pathways to social functioning. ANOVAs and Chi- square tests will be used to compare the groups on sociodemographic features, clinical features, cognitive and emotion processing performance and functional outcomes. Linear and logistic regressions, structural equation modeling and machine learning will be used to identify predictors and model pathways to functional outcomes, taking into account possible mediators.  Data from this study will increase our understanding of the impact of comorbid PSD+CUD on cognition, emotion processing and pathways to functional outcomes. We will also characterize the sociodemographic and clinical correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD. This will allow to identify those at risk for comorbid PSD+CUD, and to tailor personalized prevention and intervention approaches, targeting specific factors identified in the models. For example, cognitive and emotion processing impairments are modifiable through cognitive/emotion processing remediation strategies. The overall goal of the current application is to examine the impact of the common comorbidity of psychosis spectrum disorders (PSD) and cocaine use disorders (CUD) on cognition, emotion processing and social functioning. We will also characterize the clinical and sociodemographic correlates of PSD+CUD and explore predictors and pathways to functional outcomes. Understanding the clinical and sociodemographic correlates of comorbid PSD+CUD, and the factors that underlie functional outcomes, will allow to identify those at risk and tailor personalized prevention and intervention approaches.","Emotion Processing, Cognition and Functioning in Comorbid Psychosis Spectrum and Cocaine Use Disorders",9599895,R03DA045094,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cannabis', 'Chi-Square Tests', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Control Groups', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self Medication', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'cocaine use', 'comparison group', 'design', 'early onset', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized prevention', 'interest', 'low socioeconomic status', 'male', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'remediation', 'research study', 'sex']",NIDA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R03,2018,127125,0.07289261170405367
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9487048,R01MH112560,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Observer Variation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Psychology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'executive function', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,474391,0.05844621115320791
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9577994,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2018,755313,0.0702960946240178
"Prefrontal-Amygdala Interactions in Social Learning PROJECT SUMMARY This R01 renewal application proposes functional neuroimaging studies with human subjects to elucidate the role of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in the processing of facial identities and expressions that predict critical social outcomes. Presentations of facial expressions of emotion in neuroimaging studies have proven particularly robust stimuli for activating amygdala and prefrontal regions involved in processing biologically- relevant social cues. Here we propose to further develop our novel structural and functional neuroimaging methods to better understand how the amygdala interacts with reciprocally connected prefrontal areas when such expressions are encountered. Specifically, following up on our previous findings that the structural integrity of an amygdala-prefrontal pathway predicts individual differences in reported anxiety – we replicated this effect in > 250 subjects and observed an exciting sex difference; this effect is compellingly stronger in females than in males. Here we propose to follow up on this effect with higher resolution DTI methods and to extend it to functional resting state data to see if the same sex difference is observed functionally. In addition, we propose a new mathematical model where we believe we can disentangle the effects of valence from arousal in brain imaging data, a confound the field continues to struggle with. Finally, we propose the development of a new facial expression stimulus set where we record the psychological status of the models posing for the expressions so we can determine any interaction this might have with the psychological status of the our subjects of study. The field can then usefully compare these data to complementary developmental research (i.e., with children and adolescents) and will be amenable  to direct translation to clinical populations (e.g., anxiety and depression). The experiments proposed here will increase our understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in  this learning. A number of experiments highlight an important difference between men and women that  we discovered during our last grant and follow up on here. Specifically, brain connections with the  prefrontal cortex in females explain how anxious they report being but we do not see this effect in  males. With this information, we can then better understand what goes wrong in the brains of  individuals with major depression and anxiety disorders.",Prefrontal-Amygdala Interactions in Social Learning,9561940,R56MH080716,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Friends', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Same-sex', 'Sampling', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'men', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social learning', 'social situation', 'two-dimensional', 'white matter']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R56,2018,405000,0.01024087573666103
"Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis Project Summary: Brain networks linking the cortex to thalamus are critical for cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning. Dysruption of thalamocortical networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychosis, and mechanisms of clinical phenotypes, especially cognitive impairment. This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks. The availability of several large-scale cross-sectional datasets containing multi-modal neuroimaging data and extensive phenotypic data on healthy and at-risk individuals has created an unprecedented opportunity to address these critical knowledge gaps. They include the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN: n=656, ages 18-88); Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI- RS: n=932, ages 6-85); Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset (PING: N=1239, ages 3-20); Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC: n=1601, ages 8-21), which includes psychosis spectrum (PS) youth; and the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS: n=397). Building on our prior work in clinical populations and leveraging the considerable resources of these datasets, we propose to chart the development of thalamocortical networks in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and youth with PS symptoms (Aim 2), characterize the associations between thalamocortical biomarkers and cognition (Aim 3), and investigate the clinical utility of thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers at identifying atypical brain development in individual subjects across the psychosis continuum and predicting conversion to psychosis in clinical high risk individuals (Aim 4). The proposed Aims will: 1) establish critical normative lifespan development data for refining and testing etiological models of not just psychosis, but other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as aging- related disorders; 2) inform the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders and contribute to dimensional models of psychosis; 3) help define the neural basis of executive cognitive abilities thereby providing the necessary foundation for mechanistic models of normal cognitive function and cognitive impairment in psychosis; and 4) potentially provide risk biomarkers and intervention targets for youth at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Public Health Relevance: Many psychiatric disorders emerge between childhood and early adulthood, a period when the brain is undergoing significant developmental changes, and are associated with cognitive impairment which leads to lifelong limitations in psychosocial functioning. Determining how and when premorbid brain development goes awry, clarifying the neural basis of cognitive impairment, and establishing the clinical utility of brain-based biomarkers at predicting illness onset in individuals at high risk for neuropsychiatric illness are essential to developing targeted interventions that prevent the onset of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.",Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis,9593608,R01MH115000,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'symptomatology', 'young adult']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,447624,0.05872968722322455
"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.  Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and present treatment only works for a limited number of patients. In order to identify new therapeutic targets, we will longitudinally characterize the underlying pathologies in those with poor treatment response using complimentary brain imaging modalities.",Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients,9521079,R01MH113800,"['Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine Antagonists', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Protons', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Risperidone', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'aripiprazole', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain abnormalities', 'cingulate cortex', 'drug development', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'longitudinal design', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'new therapeutic target', 'patient subsets', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2018,735068,0.0727002966903807
"Neurophysiology of auditory emotion recognition in the human brain Summary/Abstract:  Auditory emotion recognition (AER) is the process of extracting emotional content out of the acoustic features of speech, and is disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders including autism and schizophrenia. Both the encoding of this information in the auditory cortex as well as the knowledge of which brain areas participate in the circuit that underlies AER are not known. With a unique access to invasive intracranial neurophysiology in awake, behaving humans, we propose to study the neural basis of AER in patients undergoing invasive electrode monitoring as part of staged epilepsy surgery protocols. These subjects will perform an AER task while brain responses are recorded in an effort to decipher the neural processes that identify emotion and while specific areas of their brain are stimulated in order to causally link focal activation of AER circuit components to perception.  In Aim 1, we will identify the neuronal mechanisms underlying emotion recognition using a task that breaks down AER into three sequential steps: encoding, integration and judgment. First, we will identify the encoding of emotionally relevant acoustic cues by examining how sensory features such as pitch, intensity and modulation are encoded by neuronal responses in the auditory cortex and other brain areas involved in emotional processing such as the amygdala, insula and prefrontal cortex. Second, we will examine how these acoustic cues are integrated into an emergent emotional percept by measuring activity in putative areas as well as the interaction among these areas after relevant sensory input while subjects consider possible responses. Finally, we will examine the subjects’ response to the AER task and correlate the judgment of emotion with the extent to which it can be predicted by neuronal activity in different brain regions of interest. While most analyses will focus on intraindividual data, differences in brain activity as it relates to AER will be compared in males versus females in order to examine biological differences in AER between sexes. In aim 2, we will determine the effect of neural stimulation on AER. We will apply focal single pulse stimulation to brain areas at those critical time windows identified in aim 1 in order to bias emotional decisions. This type of stimulation results in very focal and temporally restricted disruption of function and can be used to determine a brain area’s causal role in perception.  We seek to build a detailed neurobiological model of the AER. This would be a precursor to designing individualized therapeutic approaches to treat deficits in auditory emotional processing as well as identifying putative targets to treat affective disorders in general.

"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,9523855,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,594230,0.07110931109487927
"Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues. People signal their internal emotional state by a range of cues including facial expressions, non-verbal vocalizations and the tone and content of speech. Much work to date on emotional signaling has focused on a small number of emotions and has relied on stimulus sets with limited numbers of exemplars and poor representation of individuals of different ages and ethnicities. The computer vision literature has long recognized the need to be able to compare models, for example of face recognition, across complex, diverse, and naturalistic stimulus sets. Here, we argue that a parallel approach needs to be applied if we are to achieve a robust and generalizable understanding of how the human brain represents emotion and identity related information derived from facial and vocal cues. Three multi-session functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments are proposed. In the first, participants will view a large corpus (~2000) of faces of individuals varying in age, gender and ethnicity and showing a wide range of emotional expressions. In the second, participants will be presented with a large (~1000) and equally diverse set of emotional vocalizations. The third experiment will make use of an even more complex and naturalistic stimulus set comprising ~1000 video clips of individuals expressing emotions through facial expression, non-verbal vocalizations and emotion-laden speech. This set will be broken into three parts, with as closely matched content as possible. These will be presented to participants in audio only, visual only and audio-visual (bimodal) conditions, with the stimuli allocated to each condition balanced across participants. For each experiment, data collection will comprise separate Model Estimation and Model Validation periods with the majority of stimuli presented at Validation being distinct from those presented at Estimation. A range of models will be fit to the fMRI data acquired during Estimation runs and tested and compared using data acquired during Validation runs. These models contain sets of features that describe the emotional content of the stimuli presented in terms of either dimensional or categorical models of emotion. By comparing the fit of these models we can determine which models capture most variance in voxel response profiles and examine how this varies across brain regions. Across the three experiments, we also seek to establish whether there are regions where voxels show common coding of emotional state regardless of whether information is carried by facial or vocal cues or a combination of both. Further, by contrasting models with and without terms for characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity we can also investigate the (in)dependence of the representation of emotion and identity-related features. The proposed research has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of how cues to others' emotional state are represented in the human brain and the extent to which this is influenced by the characteristics of the person we are interacting with. In the medium term, we plan to extend this to also model listener/ viewer characteristics (both demographics and predisposition to anxiety or depression) in a hope to advance our understanding of how biases in the interpretation of emotional signals can arise. Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial  and vocal cues. Individuals with psychiatric conditions ranging from Social Anxiety and Depression to Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia struggle to correctly interpret others' emotional states. To understand how alterations in brain function can give rise to the misperception of emotion cues, we first need better normative models of how information about others' emotional state derived from facial and vocal cues is represented within the human brain. Hence, here we use large, diverse and naturalistic stimulus sets encompassing facial expressions, emotional vocalizations and multi-modal videos to investigate the extent to which consistent representation of emotional state is observed across stimulus modalities, and to explore the organizational principles that can best explain voxel response profiles or tuning patterns to facial and vocal emotion cues.",Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues,9545868,R01MH112541,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Literature', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Research', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'data acquisition', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'information model', 'neural model', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social anxiety', 'theories', 'trait', 'visual information', 'visual neuroscience', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,125000,0.09672289603405068
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis,9505230,K23MH116130,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Israel', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'economic cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal course', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'responsible research conduct', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIMH,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2018,191000,0.04183751448932532

"Automated linguistic analyses of semantics and syntax in speech output in the psychosis prodrome:  A novel paradigm to evaluate subtle thought disorder. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decades, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a range of cognitive processes in an effort to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subtle thought disorder, manifest in disturbance of language production, is a feature that predates rather than follows, psychosis onset in CHR individuals, and therefore may be an indicator of schizophrenia liability. Subtle thought disorder in schizophrenia and its risk states has typically been evaluated using clinical rating scales, and occasionally labor-intensive manual methods of linguistic analysis. Here, we propose to instead use a novel automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis informed by artificial intelligence. The method derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to language. It also evaluates syntax through ""part-of-speech"" tagging. These analyses yield fine-grained indices of speech semantics and syntax that may more accurately capture subtle thought disorder and discriminate psychosis outcome among CHR individuals. Using these automated methods of speech analysis, in collaboration with computer scientists from IBM, we were able to identify a classifier with high accuracy for psychosis onset in a small CHR cohort at Columbia, which included semantic coherence from phrase to phrase, shortened phrase length, and decreased use of determiner pronouns (""which"", ""what"", ""that""). These features were correlated with prodromal symptoms but outperformed them in terms of classification accuracy. They also discriminated schizophrenia from normal speech. While promising, these automated methods of analysis require validation in a second CHR cohort. In this proposal, in collaboration with IBM, we will validate these automated methods using a large archive of speech data from the UCLA CHR cohort. This dataset has several advantages. First, the UCLA CHR cohort has a high prevalence of psychosis transition, important as machine learning is sensitive to group size. Second, it has undergone prior manual linguistic analysis, identifying features of language production that predicted psychosis outcome; hence, automated and manual methods can be directly compared. Third, there are speech data available from healthy controls and recent-onset psychosis patients (for validation). Fourth, several participants have multiple speech assays (such that stability of the classifier can be examined). Beyond validation of methods, we will maximize group size and combine speech data from Columbia and UCLA to characterize a common classifier of psychosis outcome. Automated methods for language analysis may improve prediction of psychosis onset and inform remediation strategies for its prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Subtle thought disorder is an early core feature of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset: it has traditionally been evaluated using clinical ratings or labor-intensive manual linguistic analyses. This proposal will apply novel computer-based speech analysis methods to existing datasets to identify abnormal semantic and syntactic features of language production that can predict or classify psychosis outcome among youths at clinical high risk for psychosis. Improved characterization of thought disorder can inform targeted preventive interventions for young people at risk for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, so as to reduce the morbidity of psychosis.",Automated linguistic analyses of semantics and syntax in speech output in the psychosis prodrome:  A novel paradigm to evaluate subtle thought disorder.,9231498,R03MH108933,"['Address', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Friends', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'disabling symptom', 'effective intervention', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'phrases', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'standard of care', 'syntax', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R03,2017,35453,-0.027812812087863487
"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9331744,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'EEG-based imaging', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,193734,0.07527247483254261
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods.

"Craniofacial Microsmia: Facial Expression from Ages 1 to 3 Years Project Summary Significance. Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development. Children with CFM have elevated levels of internalizing behavior (shy, withdrawn) and reduced social competence and peer acceptance. Unknown at present are the mechanisms through which CFM and these social-emotional outcomes become linked. Facial asymmetries and cranial neuropathies associated with CFM likely play an important role in impairing socio-emotional outcomes. Asymmetries of the facial skeleton, soft tissue, and cranial nerve have both intra- and interpersonal effects. Intra-personally, they impact function (unilateral hearing loss, malocclusion, facial expressiveness) and form (noticeable craniofacial malformations), which can impair social signaling and responsiveness. Because asymmetry is negatively correlated with attractiveness, there may be non-specific social effects as well. Many surgical treatments for CFM are designed to restore facial symmetry in static pose (e.g., neutral expression). Less is known about restoring or even measuring spontaneous facial expressiveness. From a developmental perspective, one of the most important consequences of limitations in facial muscle movement is its potentially negative impact on affective communication. In a longitudinal design, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry increase risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, the findings would inform our understanding of socio-emotional development in children with CFM and contribute to clinical evaluation and treatment. Innovation. This is the first effort to 1) use automated, objective measurement of facial expressiveness of communicative behavior and functional asymmetry of children with CFM; 2) model change with development in these parameters and their relation to internalizing and externalizing problems; and 3) use machine learning to investigate the relation among dynamics of expressiveness and asymmetry in relation to CBCL. Approach. Children with and without CFM will be video-recorded at 1 and 3 years with an examiner. Age 1 is an interactive context intended to elicit positive and negative emotion. Age 3 is an interactive context to assess expressive speech and attention. Expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry are assessed using automatic, objective computer-vision based measurement. Analyses include complementary approaches: statistical (regression and ANOVA) hypothesis testing and machine learning (convolutional neural networks). Relevance Using objective, automatic computer-vision-based measurements, we propose to test the hypothesis that deficits in facial expressiveness and structural and functional asymmetry among children with CFM increases their risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. If supported, clinical assessments of expressiveness and functional asymmetry could effectively target children for specialized interventions and be used to evaluate surgical interventions. Because the proposed procedures are cost effective, they could be applied in a wide range of settings to benefit children with craniofacial disorders and have applicability to other conditions and age groups in which facial expression is compromised (e.g., Mobius Syndrome, Bell's Palsy, injury/burns, and stroke). Project Narrative Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) is among the most common craniofacial anomalies. CFM impairs facial muscle movement, speech, and hearing, and compromises socio-emotional development. Using computer-vision based face analysis, statistical analysis (regression and ANOVA), and machine learning, we will investigate the relation among expressiveness, structural and functional asymmetry, and behavior problems in children with CFM.",Craniofacial Microsmia: Facial Expression from Ages 1 to 3 Years,9387016,R03DE026513,"['1 year old', '3 year old', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Articulation', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bell Palsy', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Burn injury', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Cranial nerve diseases', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Facial asymmetry', 'Funding', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malocclusion', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mobius Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Problem behavior', 'Procedures', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeleton', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unilateral Hearing Loss', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'age group', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cost effective', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial microsomia', 'design', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'malformation', 'outcome prediction', 'parent grant', 'peer', 'research clinical testing', 'social', 'social skills', 'soft tissue']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R03,2017,168654,0.05662428722105775
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos. The proposed computational approach supposes at least a 50-fold reduction in time compared to methods done by hand. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the nonmanuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.",Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases,9199411,R01DC014498,"['Academic achievement', 'Access to Information', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American Sign Language', 'Articulation', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Controlled Study', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Emotions', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'body position', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deafness', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'showing emotion', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,319382,0.03973546167104179
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9383530,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,666777,0.03149418242370056
"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9382777,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,711253,0.09441035914319121
"Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought to cause or exacerbate social disability in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by preventing 1) accurate detection of social/emotional information conveyed through the face, particularly the eye-region, and 2) the deployment of emotionally appropriate responses. Although the neural systems thought to underlie FER deficits in ASD are increasingly appreciated, their plasticity remains speculative. The goal of this project is to develop an assistive technology to promote facial emotion recognition in ASD [R21]. We propose that FER can be rehabilitated using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device [R33]. To develop an FER assistant, we plan to first [R21] determine whether it is possible to develop a multi-voxel classifier that is temporally predictive of successful emotion recognition during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) paradigm will interpret the output of a subject's brain to assess whether a computer-generated actor's emotion is recognized. If not, the expressed facial emotion will be increased in intensity until the computer determines that the subject has recognized the emotion. After tuning this supervised learning algorithm produced by a support vector machine (SVM), we then transform the massively multidimensional classifier to low-dimensionality space, which can be replicated by a single- or dual-EEG sensor placed on the scalp. The proof of principle is that the multivariate classifier can be forward transformed into frequency (EEG) space. The EEG sensor can be comfortably worn outside of the scanner (BCI device), and can be wirelessly linked to a portable tablet (iPad). We will then demonstrate the feasibility of an ambulatory BCI 'FER assistant' [R33] in a between-group, randomized design (genuine neurofeedback vs placebo neurofeedback). The FER assistant is a virtual reality- based iPad application that uses the EEG sensor data to assist users with emotion recognition by manipulating the avatar's emotion intensity until it is recognized by the user, who will receive points the earlier the emotion is recognized. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess feasibility including acceptability of the intervention, recruitment and randomization procedures, intervention implementation, blinded assessment procedures, and participant retention within the context of an RCT in preparation for a well- powered efficacy trial. This study's products include demonstration of the neural processes that underlie FER deficits and evidence of their plasticity, and an easily exportable, minimal-cost computer-based intervention. There has been little treatment research for this under-studied population, and social deficits may post unique challenges to people with ASD during late adolescence and early adulthood, as they face multiple life transitions and developmental tasks requiring social competence (e.g., securing employment). Ultimately, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of this emergent intervention in an adequately powered randomized clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The social disability that characterizes Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pervades other areas of adaptive behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions for adults with ASD to target social disability. We propose to first establish the neural plasticity of specific brain mechanisms underlying difficultis with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability, and subsequently develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time feedback to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.",Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism,9232220,R33MH100268,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Employment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'active method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'computer generated', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'emerging adult', 'innovation', 'neurofeedback', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'portability', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'study population', 'tool', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R33,2017,259157,0.05754124232892357
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9286515,R01MH112560,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Observer Variation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychologist', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Psychology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'executive function', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,505201,0.05844621115320791

"Prefrontal-Amygdala Interactions in Social Learning PROJECT SUMMARY This R01 renewal application proposes functional neuroimaging studies with human subjects to elucidate the role of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in the processing of facial identities and expressions that predict critical social outcomes. Presentations of facial expressions of emotion in neuroimaging studies have proven particularly robust stimuli for activating amygdala and prefrontal regions involved in processing biologically- relevant social cues. Here we propose to further develop our novel structural and functional neuroimaging methods to better understand how the amygdala interacts with reciprocally connected prefrontal areas when such expressions are encountered. Specifically, following up on our previous findings that the structural integrity of an amygdala-prefrontal pathway predicts individual differences in reported anxiety – we replicated this effect in > 250 subjects and observed an exciting sex difference; this effect is compellingly stronger in females than in males. Here we propose to follow up on this effect with higher resolution DTI methods and to extend it to functional resting state data to see if the same sex difference is observed functionally. In addition, we propose a new mathematical model where we believe we can disentangle the effects of valence from arousal in brain imaging data, a confound the field continues to struggle with. Finally, we propose the development of a new facial expression stimulus set where we record the psychological status of the models posing for the expressions so we can determine any interaction this might have with the psychological status of the our subjects of study. The field can then usefully compare these data to complementary developmental research (i.e., with children and adolescents) and will be amenable  to direct translation to clinical populations (e.g., anxiety and depression). The experiments proposed here will increase our understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in  this learning. A number of experiments highlight an important difference between men and women that  we discovered during our last grant and follow up on here.

"Neurophysiology of auditory emotion recognition in the human brain Summary/Abstract:  Auditory emotion recognition (AER) is the process of extracting emotional content out of the acoustic features of speech, and is disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders including autism and schizophrenia. Both the encoding of this information in the auditory cortex as well as the knowledge of which brain areas participate in the circuit that underlies AER are not known. With a unique access to invasive intracranial neurophysiology in awake, behaving humans, we propose to study the neural basis of AER in patients undergoing invasive electrode monitoring as part of staged epilepsy surgery protocols. These subjects will perform an AER task while brain responses are recorded in an effort to decipher the neural processes that identify emotion and while specific areas of their brain are stimulated in order to causally link focal activation of AER circuit components to perception.  In Aim 1, we will identify the neuronal mechanisms underlying emotion recognition using a task that breaks down AER into three sequential steps: encoding, integration and judgment. First, we will identify the encoding of emotionally relevant acoustic cues by examining how sensory features such as pitch, intensity and modulation are encoded by neuronal responses in the auditory cortex and other brain areas involved in emotional processing such as the amygdala, insula and prefrontal cortex. Second, we will examine how these acoustic cues are integrated into an emergent emotional percept by measuring activity in putative areas as well as the interaction among these areas after relevant sensory input while subjects consider possible responses. Finally, we will examine the subjects’ response to the AER task and correlate the judgment of emotion with the extent to which it can be predicted by neuronal activity in different brain regions of interest. While most analyses will focus on intraindividual data, differences in brain activity as it relates to AER will be compared in males versus females in order to examine biological differences in AER between sexes. In aim 2, we will determine the effect of neural stimulation on AER. We will apply focal single pulse stimulation to brain areas at those critical time windows identified in aim 1 in order to bias emotional decisions. This type of stimulation results in very focal and temporally restricted disruption of function and can be used to determine a brain area’s causal role in perception.  We seek to build a detailed neurobiological model of the AER. This would be a precursor to designing individualized therapeutic approaches to treat deficits in auditory emotional processing as well as identifying putative targets to treat affective disorders in general. Narrative: Identifying emotion in speech is a critical brain process required for social interaction and is impaired in many neuropsychiatric diseases. We will study how the brain codes the emotional content of speech and how stimulating specific brain areas can potentially improve this process. !",Neurophysiology of auditory emotion recognition in the human brain,9373513,R21MH114166,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Communication', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychologist', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'behavioral study', 'computer studies', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'men', 'neural model', 'neural stimulation', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'physical property', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'sex', 'social', 'social skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,R21,2017,253863,0.0030077966016183143
"Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues. People signal their internal emotional state by a range of cues including facial expressions, non-verbal vocalizations and the tone and content of speech. Much work to date on emotional signaling has focused on a small number of emotions and has relied on stimulus sets with limited numbers of exemplars and poor representation of individuals of different ages and ethnicities. The computer vision literature has long recognized the need to be able to compare models, for example of face recognition, across complex, diverse, and naturalistic stimulus sets. Here, we argue that a parallel approach needs to be applied if we are to achieve a robust and generalizable understanding of how the human brain represents emotion and identity related information derived from facial and vocal cues. Three multi-session functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments are proposed. In the first, participants will view a large corpus (~2000) of faces of individuals varying in age, gender and ethnicity and showing a wide range of emotional expressions. In the second, participants will be presented with a large (~1000) and equally diverse set of emotional vocalizations. The third experiment will make use of an even more complex and naturalistic stimulus set comprising ~1000 video clips of individuals expressing emotions through facial expression, non-verbal vocalizations and emotion-laden speech. This set will be broken into three parts, with as closely matched content as possible. These will be presented to participants in audio only, visual only and audio-visual (bimodal) conditions, with the stimuli allocated to each condition balanced across participants. For each experiment, data collection will comprise separate Model Estimation and Model Validation periods with the majority of stimuli presented at Validation being distinct from those presented at Estimation. A range of models will be fit to the fMRI data acquired during Estimation runs and tested and compared using data acquired during Validation runs. These models contain sets of features that describe the emotional content of the stimuli presented in terms of either dimensional or categorical models of emotion. By comparing the fit of these models we can determine which models capture most variance in voxel response profiles and examine how this varies across brain regions. Across the three experiments, we also seek to establish whether there are regions where voxels show common coding of emotional state regardless of whether information is carried by facial or vocal cues or a combination of both. Further, by contrasting models with and without terms for characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity we can also investigate the (in)dependence of the representation of emotion and identity-related features. The proposed research has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of how cues to others' emotional state are represented in the human brain and the extent to which this is influenced by the characteristics of the person we are interacting with. In the medium term, we plan to extend this to also model listener/ viewer characteristics (both demographics and predisposition to anxiety or depression) in a hope to advance our understanding of how biases in the interpretation of emotional signals can arise. Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial  and vocal cues. Individuals with psychiatric conditions ranging from Social Anxiety and Depression to Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia struggle to correctly interpret others' emotional states. To understand how alterations in brain function can give rise to the misperception of emotion cues, we first need better normative models of how information about others' emotional state derived from facial and vocal cues is represented within the human brain. Hence, here we use large, diverse and naturalistic stimulus sets encompassing facial expressions, emotional vocalizations and multi-modal videos to investigate the extent to which consistent representation of emotional state is observed across stimulus modalities, and to explore the organizational principles that can best explain voxel response profiles or tuning patterns to facial and vocal emotion cues.",Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues,9285649,R01MH112541,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Literature', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Research', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'data acquisition', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'information model', 'neural model', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social anxiety', 'theories', 'trait', 'visual information', 'visual neuroscience', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2017,125000,0.09672289603405068
"Automated linguistic analyses of semantics and syntax in speech output in the psychosis prodrome:  A novel paradigm to evaluate subtle thought disorder. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decades, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a range of cognitive processes in an effort to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subtle thought disorder, manifest in disturbance of language production, is a feature that predates rather than follows, psychosis onset in CHR individuals, and therefore may be an indicator of schizophrenia liability. Subtle thought disorder in schizophrenia and its risk states has typically been evaluated using clinical rating scales, and occasionally labor-intensive manual methods of linguistic analysis. Here, we propose to instead use a novel automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis informed by artificial intelligence. The method derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to language. It also evaluates syntax through ""part-of-speech"" tagging. These analyses yield fine-grained indices of speech semantics and syntax that may more accurately capture subtle thought disorder and discriminate psychosis outcome among CHR individuals. Using these automated methods of speech analysis, in collaboration with computer scientists from IBM, we were able to identify a classifier with high accuracy for psychosis onset in a small CHR cohort at Columbia, which included semantic coherence from phrase to phrase, shortened phrase length, and decreased use of determiner pronouns (""which"", ""what"", ""that""). These features were correlated with prodromal symptoms but outperformed them in terms of classification accuracy. They also discriminated schizophrenia from normal speech. While promising, these automated methods of analysis require validation in a second CHR cohort. In this proposal, in collaboration with IBM, we will validate these automated methods using a large archive of speech data from the UCLA CHR cohort. This dataset has several advantages. First, the UCLA CHR cohort has a high prevalence of psychosis transition, important as machine learning is sensitive to group size. Second, it has undergone prior manual linguistic analysis, identifying features of language production that predicted psychosis outcome; hence, automated and manual methods can be directly compared. Third, there are speech data available from healthy controls and recent-onset psychosis patients (for validation). Fourth, several participants have multiple speech assays (such that stability of the classifier can be examined). Beyond validation of methods, we will maximize group size and combine speech data from Columbia and UCLA to characterize a common classifier of psychosis outcome. Automated methods for language analysis may improve prediction of psychosis onset and inform remediation strategies for its prevention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Subtle thought disorder is an early core feature of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset: it has traditionally been evaluated using clinical ratings or labor-intensive manual linguistic analyses. This proposal will apply novel computer-based speech analysis methods to existing datasets to identify abnormal semantic and syntactic features of language production that can predict or classify psychosis outcome among youths at clinical high risk for psychosis. Improved characterization of thought disorder can inform targeted preventive interventions for young people at risk for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, so as to reduce the morbidity of psychosis.            ",Automated linguistic analyses of semantics and syntax in speech output in the psychosis prodrome:  A novel paradigm to evaluate subtle thought disorder.,9017082,R03MH108933,"['Address', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Friends', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'disabling symptom', 'effective intervention', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'phrases', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'standard of care', 'syntax', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R03,2016,81000,-0.027812812087863487
"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9176279,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2016,574983,0.07527247483254261
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods.

"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use. The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.",Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use,9029353,R01MH096951,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Gender', 'Generic Drugs', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Interviewer', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'positive emotional state', 'skin color', 'suicidal risk', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,452541,0.11147705713964114
"Computational Methods for the Study of American Sign Language Nonmanuals Using Very Large Databases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hands) and by the nonmanual components, which include the face. Our general hypothesis is that nonmanual facial articulations perform significant semantic and syntactic functions by means of a more extensive set of facial expressions than that seen in other communicative systems (e.g., speech and emotion). This proposal will systematically study this hypothesis. Specifically, we will study the following three hypotheses needed to properly answer the general hypothesis stated above: First, we hypothesize (H1) that the facial muscles involved in the production of clause-level grammatical facial expressions in ASL and/or their intensity of activation are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Second, we hypothesize (H2) that the temporal structure of these facial configurations are more extensive than those seen in speech and emotion. Finally, we hypothesize (H3) that eliminating these ASL nonmanual makers from the original videos, drastically reduces the chances of correctly identifying the clause type of the signed sentence. To test these three hypotheses, we define a highly innovative approach based on the design of computational tools for the analysis of nonmanuals in signing. In particular, we will examine the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build a series of computer algorithms that allow us to automatically (i.e., without the need of any human intervention) detect the face, its facial features as well as the automatic detection of the movements of the facial muscles and their intensity of activation. These tools will be integrated into ELAN, a standard software used for linguistic analysis. These tools will then be used to test six specific hypotheses to successfully study H1. In Aim 2, we define computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify the temporal structure of ASL facial configurations and examine how these compare to those seen in speech and emotion. We will study six specific hypotheses to successfully address H2. Alternative hypotheses are defined in both aims. Finally, in Aim 3 we define algorithms to automatically modify the original videos of facial expression in ASL to eliminate the identified nonmanual markers. Native users of ASL will complete behavioral experiments to examine H3 and test potential alternative hypotheses. Comparative analysis with non-signer controls will also be completed. These studies will thus further validate H1 and H2. We provide evidence of our ability to successfully complete the tasks in each of these aims. These aims address a critical need; at present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out by hand. To be able to draw conclusive results, it is necessary to study thousands of videos.

"Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought to cause or exacerbate social disability in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by preventing 1) accurate detection of social/emotional information conveyed through the face, particularly the eye-region, and 2) the deployment of emotionally appropriate responses. Although the neural systems thought to underlie FER deficits in ASD are increasingly appreciated, their plasticity remains speculative. The goal of this project is to develop an assistive technology to promote facial emotion recognition in ASD [R21]. We propose that FER can be rehabilitated using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device [R33]. To develop an FER assistant, we plan to first [R21] determine whether it is possible to develop a multi-voxel classifier that is temporally predictive of successful emotion recognition during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) paradigm will interpret the output of a subject's brain to assess whether a computer-generated actor's emotion is recognized. If not, the expressed facial emotion will be increased in intensity until the computer determines that the subject has recognized the emotion. After tuning this supervised learning algorithm produced by a support vector machine (SVM), we then transform the massively multidimensional classifier to low-dimensionality space, which can be replicated by a single- or dual-EEG sensor placed on the scalp. The proof of principle is that the multivariate classifier can be forward transformed into frequency (EEG) space. The EEG sensor can be comfortably worn outside of the scanner (BCI device), and can be wirelessly linked to a portable tablet (iPad). We will then demonstrate the feasibility of an ambulatory BCI 'FER assistant' [R33] in a between-group, randomized design (genuine neurofeedback vs placebo neurofeedback). The FER assistant is a virtual reality- based iPad application that uses the EEG sensor data to assist users with emotion recognition by manipulating the avatar's emotion intensity until it is recognized by the user, who will receive points the earlier the emotion is recognized. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess feasibility including acceptability of the intervention, recruitment and randomization procedures, intervention implementation, blinded assessment procedures, and participant retention within the context of an RCT in preparation for a well- powered efficacy trial. This study's products include demonstration of the neural processes that underlie FER deficits and evidence of their plasticity, and an easily exportable, minimal-cost computer-based intervention. There has been little treatment research for this under-studied population, and social deficits may post unique challenges to people with ASD during late adolescence and early adulthood, as they face multiple life transitions and developmental tasks requiring social competence (e.g., securing employment). Ultimately, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of this emergent intervention in an adequately powered randomized clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The social disability that characterizes Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pervades other areas of adaptive behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions for adults with ASD to target social disability. We propose to first establish the neural plasticity of specific brain mechanisms underlying difficultis with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability, and subsequently develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time feedback to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.",Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism,9131476,R33MH100268,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Employment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'active method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'computer generated', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'emerging adult', 'innovation', 'neurofeedback', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'study population', 'tool', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R33,2016,346148,0.05754124232892357
"Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia Project Summary ""Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention in Schizophrenia”  Schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating disorders in the world today. It affects over 2.4 million adult Americans each year. NIMH director Dr. Thomas Insel has declared “The best chance for preventing serious functional disability among people with schizophrenia may be to intervene at the earliest stages of the disorder, at the first episode of psychosis or even before symptoms appear. However, to act before symptoms appear requires improved predictive capacity” (NIMH 2011 Budget). Creating tools to identify high-risk, `prodromal' individuals may be the single most important step towards developing effective interventions to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), and thereby also reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown that over 54% of individuals with schizophrenia are re-hospitalized within the first 12 months following their initial hospitalization. Even after the first hospitalization, preventing relapse and re-hospitalization may lessen the long-term severity of the illness. In this SBIR Phase I study, we propose to determine the feasibility of screening for prodromal individuals and individuals at high risk of relapse by applying interpretive algorithms to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD). We hypothesize that PGMSD can effectively assist in screening for prodromal individuals who are progressing toward psychosis as well as for remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP).  In Phase I, we plan to recruit 70 individuals who have been or are being evaluated at the Prodromal clinics at Columbia, UCSD, and UCLA, where an estimated 70 to 90% of clients already own Smartphones. Data gathered may include: the frequency of telephone calls, emails, and texts, to assess within person changes in social connectedness; GPS, accelerometer data, to assess physical activity, isolation, and sleep patterns. In the past, several IRB-approved studies have used smartphones for gathering similar data from patients. Algorithms will be developed using several techniques including machine learning to convert the meta-level data into measures of social functioning, physical isolation, physical activity, and sleep/wake reversals. In addition to achieving technological success, our goal in Phase I is to provide evidence of our ability to use PGMSD algorithms to differentiating group means of participants who are controls, prodromal, or experiencing their FEP (SIPS 1 or 2; 3, 4, or 5; or 6).  In Phase II, we will further develop and validate these algorithms. If successful, the Phase II project will have a large and sustained impact as our algorithms will help (1) identify at-risk individuals who `are' or `are not' progressing toward conversion, (2) serve as an objective measure of treatment effectiveness; (3) give rise to clinical reports delivered to EHR systems that hold promise for preventing relapse during the critical 12 months after initial diagnosis, potentially reducing hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. Project Narrative The proposed research protocol seeks to determine the feasibility of identifying individuals progressing toward a first psychotic episode or re-hospitalization by applying interpretive algorithms developed in part using machine learning to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD) collected from the smartphones of 70 participants ages 18-30. If successful, the PGMSD-derived algorithms will assist in screening for prodromal individuals progressing toward psychosis as well as with remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP), potentially decrease hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. This passive data gathering approach will augment existing active data collection approaches, aid clinicians in focusing on interpreting rather than gathering data from their clients, and could modify clinical paradigms by shifting treatment from individuals suffering from Schizophrenia to individuals who are at risk of developing psychosis with the goal of achieving `secondary' and eventually `primary' prevention.",Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia,9201713,R43MH107097,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Incipient Schizophrenia', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupational', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Poverty', 'Primary Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Universities', 'Work', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'information gathering', 'insight', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prevent', 'programs', 'real world application', 'relapse risk', 'screening', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R43,2016,366201,0.05147816421212182
"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,9132618,F30MH106191,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electromyography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Muscle', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive task', 'coping', 'depression model', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional adjustment', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'prognostic significance', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standardize measure', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2016,48332,0.03727004140639918

"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,9124921,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'dynamic system', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2016,504474,0.022286932206078573
"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness. Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.",The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing,9033949,R01MH078829,"['1 year old', '3 year old', 'AVPR1A gene', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Anger', 'Animal Model', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'DRD4 gene', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inferior', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Nature', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'RGS2 gene', 'Scalp structure', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'anxious behavior', 'base', 'design', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'innovation', 'language onset', 'lens', 'neurodevelopment', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'signal processing', 'social', 'social communication', 'stimulus processing', 'tool']",NIMH,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,871361,0.09136700808295108
"Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses NIH's call to promote data sharing and patient privacy. A major obstacle to sharing of recorded video has been the need to protect participants' identity. Similarly, concern about stigma is a reason that many people in need of mental health services (e.g., in the military) fail to do so. We propose a system to de-identify patients and research participants in video. Face de-identification transfers facial expression automatically from source face images, which are confidential, to target face images, which are not. The system safeguards face anonymity while preserving the facial expression of the original source video. The target video then can communicate the emotion, communicative intent, pain, and neurological or physiological status of the source person without displaying the source person's face. Face de-identification would enable video archive sharing among researchers and clinicians without compromising privacy or confidentiality. Moreover, a version of this system could potentially be used to preserve privacy and anonymity in internet-based interviews. Innovation. The project has four innovations. The approach (1) Removes identity information while retaining facial dynamics; thus preserving the information value of the face to communicate emotion, pain, and related states. (2) Accommodates subtle and spontaneous facial actions, rather than imitating only some predefined molar expressions (e.g., happy or sad). (3) Requires no training steps by target persons. (4) And requires no hand annotation of video. The system is entirely automatic. Approach. The software will take as input a video with the face of a subject (source) and automatically generate or output a video with the face de-identified. The project will use new machine learning and computer vision algorithms for transferring subtle facial expression from a source subject (original video) to a target subject, using only one frontal image of the target subject. A major novelty of the approach is to make the process completely automatic. The algorithm will be validated using commercially available software for face recognition and custom software for facial expression analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sharing of video recordings for research and clinical uses would significantly contribute to scientific discovery and patient diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. We will develop and validate a fully automatic system that preserves facial expression in video while fully protecting face identity.",Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use,8908047,R21MH099487,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informed Consent', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Source', 'Step training', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Video Recording', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'patient privacy', 'sex', 'social stigma', 'targeted imaging', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,193512,0.046356803071178634
"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use. The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.",Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use,8816133,R01MH096951,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Gender', 'Generic Drugs', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Interviewer', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'positive emotional state', 'skin color', 'suicidal risk', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,452541,0.11147705713964114
"Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought to cause or exacerbate social disability in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by preventing 1) accurate detection of social/emotional information conveyed through the face, particularly the eye-region, and 2) the deployment of emotionally appropriate responses. Although the neural systems thought to underlie FER deficits in ASD are increasingly appreciated, their plasticity remains speculative. The goal of this project is to develop an assistive technology to promote facial emotion recognition in ASD [R21]. We propose that FER can be rehabilitated using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device [R33]. To develop an FER assistant, we plan to first [R21] determine whether it is possible to develop a multi-voxel classifier that is temporally predictive of successful emotion recognition during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) paradigm will interpret the output of a subject's brain to assess whether a computer-generated actor's emotion is recognized. If not, the expressed facial emotion will be increased in intensity until the computer determines that the subject has recognized the emotion. After tuning this supervised learning algorithm produced by a support vector machine (SVM), we then transform the massively multidimensional classifier to low-dimensionality space, which can be replicated by a single- or dual-EEG sensor placed on the scalp. The proof of principle is that the multivariate classifier can be forward transformed into frequency (EEG) space. The EEG sensor can be comfortably worn outside of the scanner (BCI device), and can be wirelessly linked to a portable tablet (iPad). We will then demonstrate the feasibility of an ambulatory BCI 'FER assistant' [R33] in a between-group, randomized design (genuine neurofeedback vs placebo neurofeedback). The FER assistant is a virtual reality- based iPad application that uses the EEG sensor data to assist users with emotion recognition by manipulating the avatar's emotion intensity until it is recognized by the user, who will receive points the earlier the emotion is recognized. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess feasibility including acceptability of the intervention, recruitment and randomization procedures, intervention implementation, blinded assessment procedures, and participant retention within the context of an RCT in preparation for a well- powered efficacy trial. This study's products include demonstration of the neural processes that underlie FER deficits and evidence of their plasticity, and an easily exportable, minimal-cost computer-based intervention. There has been little treatment research for this under-studied population, and social deficits may post unique challenges to people with ASD during late adolescence and early adulthood, as they face multiple life transitions and developmental tasks requiring social competence (e.g., securing employment). Ultimately, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of this emergent intervention in an adequately powered randomized clinical trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The social disability that characterizes Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pervades other areas of adaptive behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions for adults with ASD to target social disability. We propose to first establish the neural plasticity of specific brain mechanisms underlying difficultis with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability, and subsequently develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time feedback to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.",Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism,8821669,R21MH100268,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Employment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'active method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'computer generated', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'emerging adult', 'innovation', 'neurofeedback', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R21,2015,225262,0.05754124232892357
"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,8978161,F30MH106191,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electromyography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Muscle', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive task', 'coping', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional adjustment', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standardize measure', 'success', 'theories', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2015,33015,0.03727004140639918
"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,8897409,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2015,521457,0.022286932206078573
"The Development and neural Bases of Emotion Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness. Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness.

"Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amphetamine dependence (AD) is an important public health problem, which has been linked to persistent executive and affective processing impairments. Specifically, amphetamine dependent individuals (ADI) demonstrate poor decision-making, particularly with respect to keeping track of new information and using this knowledge to guide future decisions. In addition, ADI have difficulties in appraising and regulating negative emotion, which has been linked to poor social functioning and higher likelihood of relapse. Given that emotion plays an important role in modulating and guiding decision-making, surprisingly little is known about how such dysfunctions interact in ADI, and how they may contribute to impairments in everyday functioning. Bayesian learning models provide a way to formally represent an individual's beliefs about the environment and the dynamic updating of those beliefs when new observations are made. Such computational framework can help to better delineate the potential impact of emotion on the dynamic representation of individuals' expectations about choice options, on the degree to which this cumulative knowledge is used to predict future outcomes, and on the cognitive strategies individuals use to select actions. The proposed study will use such Bayesian modeling approach, combined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to assess the neurocognitive processes underlying a) potential deficits in the strategic and predictive processes guiding reward-based decision-making in ADI and b) ADI potential overrepresentation of or failure to integrate negative emotion into such decision-making. To do so, 40 ADI and 40 healthy comparison subjects (CS) will perform a gambling task under neutral and sad mood, and while undergoing fMRI. Several decision strategies and the associated Bayesian outcome predictions will be estimated and correlated with neural activity at the time of decision. These measures will be used to assess and quantify differences between ADI and CS 1) in the computational processes underlying reward-based decision (Aim1) and 2) in the computational processes underlying the integration of negative emotion into reward-based decision-making (Aim 2). The outcomes of this study will help to refine neurocognitive models of AD by delineating the computational processes that go awry in ADI and will help identify more precise neurocognitive predictors of executive and affective dysfunction an ADI.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amphetamine dependence has been linked to decision-making and emotion processing impairments. Understanding how the disease may impact the computational mechanisms underlying affect infusion into decision-making will provide a mechanistic rationale for developing interventions aimed at improving amphetamine dependent individuals' daily functioning and response to adverse emotions, and will help develop more precise severity markers and predictors of relapse for amphetamine dependence. This in turn could advantageously reduce costs to the healthcare and criminal justice systems.                ",Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence,8892807,F32DA036959,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amphetamine Dependence', 'Amphetamines', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attenuated', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Belief', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Criminal Justice', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infusion procedures', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serotonergic System', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Social support', 'System', 'Time', 'Update', 'base', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data modeling', 'expectation', 'improved', 'information processing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F32,2015,56042,0.007640176826094814
"Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses NIH's call to promote data sharing and patient privacy. A major obstacle to sharing of recorded video has been the need to protect participants' identity. Similarly, concern about stigma is a reason that many people in need of mental health services (e.g., in the military) fail to do so. We propose a system to de-identify patients and research participants in video. Face de-identification transfers facial expression automatically from source face images, which are confidential, to target face images, which are not. The system safeguards face anonymity while preserving the facial expression of the original source video. The target video then can communicate the emotion, communicative intent, pain, and neurological or physiological status of the source person without displaying the source person's face. Face de-identification would enable video archive sharing among researchers and clinicians without compromising privacy or confidentiality. Moreover, a version of this system could potentially be used to preserve privacy and anonymity in internet-based interviews. Innovation. The project has four innovations. The approach (1) Removes identity information while retaining facial dynamics; thus preserving the information value of the face to communicate emotion, pain, and related states. (2) Accommodates subtle and spontaneous facial actions, rather than imitating only some predefined molar expressions (e.g., happy or sad). (3) Requires no training steps by target persons. (4) And requires no hand annotation of video. The system is entirely automatic. Approach. The software will take as input a video with the face of a subject (source) and automatically generate or output a video with the face de-identified. The project will use new machine learning and computer vision algorithms for transferring subtle facial expression from a source subject (original video) to a target subject, using only one frontal image of the target subject. A major novelty of the approach is to make the process completely automatic. The algorithm will be validated using commercially available software for face recognition and custom software for facial expression analysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sharing of video recordings for research and clinical uses would significantly contribute to scientific discovery and patient diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. We will develop and validate a fully automatic system that preserves facial expression in video while fully protecting face identity.            ",Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use,8772435,R21MH099487,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informed Consent', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Source', 'Step training', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Video Recording', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'patient privacy', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'social stigma', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,194915,0.046356803071178634
"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use.          The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.

"Multivariate Representations of Emotion     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central goal of affective neuroscience is to understand the brain systems and mechanisms underlying the evaluation, experience, and expression of emotion. For example, a widely studied and hotly debated issue in the field is the manner in which biophysical responses to emotional stimuli can be characterized, whether by distinct categories or alternatively along dimensions of valence and arousal. Advances in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and computer science have fostered significant progress in identifying brain regions involved in processing emotion generally; however, consistent and specific neural markers for distinct affective states have yet to be found. This proposal uses a cutting-edge approach to this core, unresolved question in the field by harnessing emerging pattern classification techniques that are capable of detecting subtle yet coordinated signals from an array of sources. The overarching goal is to identify multivariate patterns of behavioral and biological responding to specific affective states and determine whether these states are organized according to categorical or dimensional architectures. By combining psychophysiology (Aim 1) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Aim 2), these studies will examine how humans respond to emotional stimuli that vary in duration, modality, and categorical nature. Study 1 focuses on distinct emotions elicited by instrumental music and movie clips whereas Study 2 focuses on those elicited by facial and vocal affect. Together, the aims will provide an integrative, computationally-rigorous method to identify biomarkers of specific emotions that are typically overlooked by conventional univariate statistical approaches. Applying machine learning algorithms in this innovative way could be fruitful for identifying how emotional representations are altered in affective disorders, with the potential for developing novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, identifying patterns of overlap between specific emotion categories may further aid efforts to understand comorbidity issues in anxiety and mood disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will identify patterns of brain and bodily responses that are representative of unique emotional states, using analytical methods that examine changes in multiple biological signals in concert. Identifying neural and peripheral representations of emotional states and how they relate to self-reports of emotion will provide a better understanding of how emotions are organized and coded in the brain and body. These biomarkers of specific emotions can provide clues as to how emotional processing is altered in mood and anxiety disorders and can lead to novel treatment targets.                    ",Multivariate Representations of Emotion,8685333,R21MH098149,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Face', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Music', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer science', 'design', 'emotional experience', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'movie', 'multisensory', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,235500,0.04334083265464668
"Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought to cause or exacerbate social disability in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by preventing 1) accurate detection of social/emotional information conveyed through the face, particularly the eye-region, and 2) the deployment of emotionally appropriate responses. Although the neural systems thought to underlie FER deficits in ASD are increasingly appreciated, their plasticity remains speculative. The goal of this project is to develop an assistive technology to promote facial emotion recognition in ASD [R21]. We propose that FER can be rehabilitated using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device [R33]. To develop an FER assistant, we plan to first [R21] determine whether it is possible to develop a multi-voxel classifier that is temporally predictive of successful emotion recognition during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An adaptive, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) paradigm will interpret the output of a subject's brain to assess whether a computer-generated actor's emotion is recognized. If not, the expressed facial emotion will be increased in intensity until the computer determines that the subject has recognized the emotion. After tuning this supervised learning algorithm produced by a support vector machine (SVM), we then transform the massively multidimensional classifier to low-dimensionality space, which can be replicated by a single- or dual-EEG sensor placed on the scalp. The proof of principle is that the multivariate classifier can be forward transformed into frequency (EEG) space. The EEG sensor can be comfortably worn outside of the scanner (BCI device), and can be wirelessly linked to a portable tablet (iPad). We will then demonstrate the feasibility of an ambulatory BCI 'FER assistant' [R33] in a between-group, randomized design (genuine neurofeedback vs placebo neurofeedback). The FER assistant is a virtual reality- based iPad application that uses the EEG sensor data to assist users with emotion recognition by manipulating the avatar's emotion intensity until it is recognized by the user, who will receive points the earlier the emotion is recognized. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to assess feasibility including acceptability of the intervention, recruitment and randomization procedures, intervention implementation, blinded assessment procedures, and participant retention within the context of an RCT in preparation for a well- powered efficacy trial. This study's products include demonstration of the neural processes that underlie FER deficits and evidence of their plasticity, and an easily exportable, minimal-cost computer-based intervention. There has been little treatment research for this under-studied population, and social deficits may post unique challenges to people with ASD during late adolescence and early adulthood, as they face multiple life transitions and developmental tasks requiring social competence (e.g., securing employment). Ultimately, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of this emergent intervention in an adequately powered randomized clinical trial.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The social disability that characterizes Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pervades other areas of adaptive behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions for adults with ASD to target social disability. We propose to first establish the neural plasticity of specific brain mechanisms underlying difficultis with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability, and subsequently develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time feedback to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.                ",Development of a novel neurotechnology to promote emotion recognition in autism,8635153,R21MH100268,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Employment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Secure', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'active method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'computer generated', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'emerging adult', 'innovation', 'neurofeedback', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R21,2014,269650,0.05754124232892357
"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally.

"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness.          Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.

"Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amphetamine dependence (AD) is an important public health problem, which has been linked to persistent executive and affective processing impairments. Specifically, amphetamine dependent individuals (ADI) demonstrate poor decision-making, particularly with respect to keeping track of new information and using this knowledge to guide future decisions. In addition, ADI have difficulties in appraising and regulating negative emotion, which has been linked to poor social functioning and higher likelihood of relapse. Given that emotion plays an important role in modulating and guiding decision-making, surprisingly little is known about how such dysfunctions interact in ADI, and how they may contribute to impairments in everyday functioning. Bayesian learning models provide a way to formally represent an individual's beliefs about the environment and the dynamic updating of those beliefs when new observations are made. Such computational framework can help to better delineate the potential impact of emotion on the dynamic representation of individuals' expectations about choice options, on the degree to which this cumulative knowledge is used to predict future outcomes, and on the cognitive strategies individuals use to select actions. The proposed study will use such Bayesian modeling approach, combined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to assess the neurocognitive processes underlying a) potential deficits in the strategic and predictive processes guiding reward-based decision-making in ADI and b) ADI potential overrepresentation of or failure to integrate negative emotion into such decision-making. To do so, 40 ADI and 40 healthy comparison subjects (CS) will perform a gambling task under neutral and sad mood, and while undergoing fMRI. Several decision strategies and the associated Bayesian outcome predictions will be estimated and correlated with neural activity at the time of decision. These measures will be used to assess and quantify differences between ADI and CS 1) in the computational processes underlying reward-based decision (Aim1) and 2) in the computational processes underlying the integration of negative emotion into reward-based decision-making (Aim 2). The outcomes of this study will help to refine neurocognitive models of AD by delineating the computational processes that go awry in ADI and will help identify more precise neurocognitive predictors of executive and affective dysfunction an ADI.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amphetamine dependence has been linked to decision-making and emotion processing impairments. Understanding how the disease may impact the computational mechanisms underlying affect infusion into decision-making will provide a mechanistic rationale for developing interventions aimed at improving amphetamine dependent individuals' daily functioning and response to adverse emotions, and will help develop more precise severity markers and predictors of relapse for amphetamine dependence.

"A Study of the Computational Space of Facial Expressions of Emotion  Project Summary Past research has been very successful in defining how facial expressions of emotion are produced, including which muscle movements create the most commonly seen expressions. These facial expressions of emotion are then interpreted by our visual system. Yet, little is known about how these facial expressions are recognized. The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the form and dimensions of the cognitive (computational) space used in this visual recognition. In particular, this proposal will study the following three hypotheses: Although facial expressions are produced by a complex set of muscle movements, expressions are generally easily identified at different spatial and time resolutions. However, it is not know what these limits are. Our first hypothesis (H1) is that recognition of facial expressions of emotion can be achieved at low resolutions and after short exposure times. In Aim 1, we define experiments to determine how many pixels and milliseconds (ms) are needed to successfully identify different emotions. The fact that expressions of emotion can be recognized quickly at low resolution indicates that simple features robust to image manipulation are employed. Our second hypothesis (H2) is that the recognition of facial expressions of emotion is partially accomplished by an analysis of configural features. Configural cues are known to play an important role in other face recognition tasks, but their role in the processing of expressions of emotion is not yet well understood. Aim 2 will identify a number of these configural cues. We will use real images of faces, manipulated versions of these face images, and schematic drawings. It is also known that shape features play a role in facial expressions (e.g., the curvature of the mouth in happiness). In Aim 3, we define a shape-based computational model. Our hypothesis (H3) is that the configural and shape features are defined as deviations from a mean (or norm) face as opposed to being described as a set of independent exemplars (Gnostic neurons). The importance of this computational space is not only to further justify the results of the previous aims, but to make new predictions that can be verified with additional experiments with human subjects.  Project Narrative Understanding how facial expressions of emotion are processed by our cognitive system will be important for studies of abnormal face and emotion visual processing in schizophrenia, autism and Huntington's disease. Also, abused children are more acute at recognizing emotions, suggesting a higher degree of expertise to some image features. Identifying which features are used by the cognitive system will help develop protocols for reducing their unwanted effects. Understanding the limits in spatial and time resolution will also be important for studies of low vision (acuity), which are typical problems in several eye diseases and in the normal process of aging.",A Study of the Computational Space of Facial Expressions of Emotion,8669977,R01EY020834,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Anger', 'Arts', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Child Abuse', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conscious', 'Cues', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Emotions', 'Evolution', 'Eye diseases', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Happiness', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Oral cavity', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'base', 'cognitive system', 'computer human interaction', 'computer studies', 'court', 'design', 'human subject', 'millisecond', 'psychologic', 'research study', 'showing emotion', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,358680,0.11544623226034614
"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding.

Moreover, identifying patterns of overlap between specific emotion categories may further aid efforts to understand comorbidity issues in anxiety and mood disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will identify patterns of brain and bodily responses that are representative of unique emotional states, using analytical methods that examine changes in multiple biological signals in concert. Identifying neural and peripheral representations of emotional states and how they relate to self-reports of emotion will provide a better understanding of how emotions are organized and coded in the brain and body. These biomarkers of specific emotions can provide clues as to how emotional processing is altered in mood and anxiety disorders and can lead to novel treatment targets.                    ",Multivariate Representations of Emotion,8510264,R21MH098149,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Face', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Music', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer science', 'design', 'emotional experience', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'movie', 'multisensory', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,196250,0.04334083265464668
"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.                ",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,8452565,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional RNA', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2013,571955,0.022286932206078573
"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness.          Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness.

"A Study of the Computational Space of Facial Expressions of Emotion  Project Summary Past research has been very successful in defining how facial expressions of emotion are produced, including which muscle movements create the most commonly seen expressions. These facial expressions of emotion are then interpreted by our visual system. Yet, little is known about how these facial expressions are recognized. The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the form and dimensions of the cognitive (computational) space used in this visual recognition. In particular, this proposal will study the following three hypotheses: Although facial expressions are produced by a complex set of muscle movements, expressions are generally easily identified at different spatial and time resolutions. However, it is not know what these limits are. Our first hypothesis (H1) is that recognition of facial expressions of emotion can be achieved at low resolutions and after short exposure times. In Aim 1, we define experiments to determine how many pixels and milliseconds (ms) are needed to successfully identify different emotions. The fact that expressions of emotion can be recognized quickly at low resolution indicates that simple features robust to image manipulation are employed. Our second hypothesis (H2) is that the recognition of facial expressions of emotion is partially accomplished by an analysis of configural features. Configural cues are known to play an important role in other face recognition tasks, but their role in the processing of expressions of emotion is not yet well understood. Aim 2 will identify a number of these configural cues. We will use real images of faces, manipulated versions of these face images, and schematic drawings. It is also known that shape features play a role in facial expressions (e.g., the curvature of the mouth in happiness). In Aim 3, we define a shape-based computational model. Our hypothesis (H3) is that the configural and shape features are defined as deviations from a mean (or norm) face as opposed to being described as a set of independent exemplars (Gnostic neurons). The importance of this computational space is not only to further justify the results of the previous aims, but to make new predictions that can be verified with additional experiments with human subjects.  Project Narrative Understanding how facial expressions of emotion are processed by our cognitive system will be important for studies of abnormal face and emotion visual processing in schizophrenia, autism and Huntington's disease. Also, abused children are more acute at recognizing emotions, suggesting a higher degree of expertise to some image features.

"Automated Facial Expression Analysis for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression has been a focus of emotion research for over a hundred years. In recent decades observations of facial expressions have yielded critical and dramatic insights about the etiology of psychopathology, and have proven capable of predicting treatment outcomes (see Ekman & Rosenberg, 2005). Despite these original striking findings, there has been surprisingly little follow-up work. The primary reason fr the lack of sustained research is that the most reliable manual systems for measuring facial expression often require considerable training and are labor intensive. Automated measurement using computer vision and machine learning seeks to address the need for valid, efficient, and reproducible measurement. Recent systems have shown promise in fairly small studies using posed behavior or structured contexts with confederates, or trained interviewers, or pre-trained (person-specific) face models. For automated coding to be applied in real-world settings, a large data base with ample variability in pose, head motion, skin color, gender, partial occlusion, and expression intensity is needed. We have developed a unique database that meets this need and the algorithms necessary to enable robust automated coding. The database consists of 720 participants in three-person groups engaged in a group formation task. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that our algorithms can successfully code two key facial signals associated with human emotion in this relatively unconstrained context (Cohn & Sayette, 2010). To achieve efficient, accurate, and valid measurement of facial expression usable in research and clinical settings, we aim to 1) train and validate classifiers to achieve reliable facial expression detectin across this unprecedentedly large, diverse data set; 2) extend the previous person-specific methods to person-independent (generic) facial feature detection, tracking, and alignment; and 3) make these tools available for research and clinical use.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project has two target application domains. For behavioral science, automated facial expression analysis will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion and interpersonal processes, as well as emotion processes underlying diverse forms of psychopathology and neurologic disorder. For clinical use, automated facial expression analysis will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and objectively evaluate course of treatment across a wide range of disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, suicide risk, and pain.              The project has two target application domains.

"Sensorimotor learning of facial expressions: A novel intervention for autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensorimotor learning of facial expressions: A novel intervention for autism Project Summary This application addresses broad Challenge Area (04): Clinical Research, and specific Challenge Topic 04-MH-101 Autism: Addressing the challenge: Novel interventions. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are impaired in their ability to produce and perceive dynamic facial expressions (Adolphs, Sears, and Piven, 2001). Advanced computer vision technologies can now be leveraged in the investigation of issues such as the facial expression recognition and production deficits common to children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Not only can these technologies assist in quantifying these deficits, but they can also be used as part of interventions aimed at reducing deficit severity. In this project, automated facial expression recognition will be employed for the development of training exercises for facial expression production in children with ASD. Previous research by Tanaka and Schultz developed the Let's Face It! intervention tool shown to effectively improve the face processing abilities of children with ASD. Let's Face It! focused on perception but not production. Bartlett and Movellan have developed the Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT), a computer vision system which measures 37 facial expression dimensions in real-time. This project brings together these two research groups in order to develop a computer assisted intervention system to enhance the social communication skills of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The computer vision tool enables novel interventions that focus on facial expression production. Intervention games will be developed to provide automated feedback on facial expressions produced by children with ASD in an engaging and cost- effective manner. In addition to improving production skills, practice with facial expression production may also improve perception skills by linking motor production with perception. The intervention exercises developed here will include closed-loop sensorimotor expression training in which subjects both see and produce facial expressions, and then view the effects of their facial expressions in the games. This project will also characterize facial expression production of children with ASD in a battery of assessment tasks, including automated facial expression measurement with CERT. Upon completion, this project will contribute to our understanding of facial expression production in children with ASD, provide a new intervention tool for facial expression production, and provide data on the efficacy of the intervention. The intervention system proposed here could have tremendous impact on social development in any patient population with atypical facial expression production, including ASD, and attention deficit disorder.

"A Study of the Computational Space of Facial Expressions of Emotion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Past research has been very successful in defining how facial expressions of emotion are produced, including which muscle movements create the most commonly seen expressions. These facial expressions of emotion are then interpreted by our visual system. Yet, little is known about how these facial expressions are recognized. The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the form and dimensions of the cognitive (computational) space used in this visual recognition. In particular, this proposal will study the following three hypotheses: Although facial expressions are produced by a complex set of muscle movements, expressions are generally easily identified at different spatial and time resolutions. However, it is not know what these limits are. Our first hypothesis (H1) is that recognition of facial expressions of emotion can be achieved at low resolutions and after short exposure times. In Aim 1, we define experiments to determine how many pixels and milliseconds (ms) are needed to successfully identify different emotions. The fact that expressions of emotion can be recognized quickly at low resolution indicates that simple features robust to image manipulation are employed. Our second hypothesis (H2) is that the recognition of facial expressions of emotion is partially accomplished by an analysis of configural features. Configural cues are known to play an important role in other face recognition tasks, but their role in the processing of expressions of emotion is not yet well understood. Aim 2 will identify a number of these configural cues. We will use real images of faces, manipulated versions of these face images, and schematic drawings. It is also known that shape features play a role in facial expressions (e.g., the curvature of the mouth in happiness). In Aim 3, we define a shape-based computational model. Our hypothesis (H3) is that the configural and shape features are defined as deviations from a mean (or norm) face as opposed to being described as a set of independent exemplars (Gnostic neurons). The importance of this computational space is not only to further justify the results of the previous aims, but to make new predictions that can be verified with additional experiments with human subjects.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding how facial expressions of emotion are processed by our cognitive system will be important for studies of abnormal face and emotion visual processing in schizophrenia, autism and Huntington's disease. Also, abused children are more acute at recognizing emotions, suggesting a higher degree of expertise to some image features. Identifying which features are used by the cognitive system will help develop protocols for reducing their unwanted effects. Understanding the limits in spatial and time resolution will also be important for studies of low vision (acuity), which are typical problems in several eye diseases and in the normal process of aging.           Project Narrative Understanding how facial expressions of emotion are processed by our cognitive system will be important for studies of abnormal face and emotion visual processing in schizophrenia, autism and Huntington's disease.

"Sensorimotor learning of facial expressions: A novel intervention for autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensorimotor learning of facial expressions: A novel intervention for autism Project Summary This application addresses broad Challenge Area (04): Clinical Research, and specific Challenge Topic 04-MH-101 Autism: Addressing the challenge: Novel interventions. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are impaired in their ability to produce and perceive dynamic facial expressions (Adolphs, Sears, and Piven, 2001). Advanced computer vision technologies can now be leveraged in the investigation of issues such as the facial expression recognition and production deficits common to children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Not only can these technologies assist in quantifying these deficits, but they can also be used as part of interventions aimed at reducing deficit severity. In this project, automated facial expression recognition will be employed for the development of training exercises for facial expression production in children with ASD. Previous research by Tanaka and Schultz developed the Let's Face It! intervention tool shown to effectively improve the face processing abilities of children with ASD. Let's Face It! focused on perception but not production. Bartlett and Movellan have developed the Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT), a computer vision system which measures 37 facial expression dimensions in real-time. This project brings together these two research groups in order to develop a computer assisted intervention system to enhance the social communication skills of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The computer vision tool enables novel interventions that focus on facial expression production. Intervention games will be developed to provide automated feedback on facial expressions produced by children with ASD in an engaging and cost- effective manner. In addition to improving production skills, practice with facial expression production may also improve perception skills by linking motor production with perception.

"Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal describes a project to systematically investigate the facial components, combinations of components, and interactions of components that constitute facial expressions (nonmanual markers) in the grammar of American Sign Language (ASL). Some of these components have already been shown to differ in significant ways from those used by the general hearing population. They may carry semantic, prosodic, pragmatic, and syntactic information that may not be provided by the manual signing itself. We will compile an inventory of facial articulations, construct a database of video images of these in isolation and in context, and use these data and innovative computational tools to construct a model of facial behavior in ASL. To successfully accomplish this, we propose an innovative integrated linguistic and computational approach to the study of nonmanuals. Our goal in this project is to construct an initial phonological model of ASL nonmanuals. We have targeted a relevant set of facial features and have identified 4 experiments to obtain appropriate information on each of them. A necessary step in preparation for these experiments is to develop computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms that automatically extract these facial features from a large quantity of videos. These algorithms will be capable of processing data more accurately and efficiently than can be done by hand. Finally, by comparing these results with those obtained from native ASL signers in a series of perceptual studies, we can determine what further modifications are still needed. The study of facial expressions in ASL has very practical applications to several areas affecting the lives of Deaf individuals. The absence of clear information on the facial components makes teaching them to individuals trying to learn ASL, such as parents, deaf children, future teachers and interpreters, a pedagogical nightmare. Another important practical application is the development of systems that automatically recognize ASL. Such a system is not feasible without the ability to handle ASL nonmanuals, which carry grammatical information.         n/a",Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language,7316099,R01DC005241,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Articulators', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Linguistics', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nightmare', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research Design', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Sign Language', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Trees', 'Work', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'direct application', 'innovation', 'native American sign language', 'phonology', 'practical application', 'research study', 'syntax', 'teacher']",NIDCD,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,476784,0.082234832370391

"Facial Expression Analysis by Image Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Facial expression provides cues about emotional response, regulates interpersonal behavior, and communicates aspects of psychopathology. Human-observer based methods for measuring facial expression are labor intensive, qualitative, and difficult to standardize. Our interdisciplinary team of computer and behavioral scientists has developed the CMU/Pitt Automated Facial Image Analysis (AFA) system that is capable of automatically recognizing facial action units and analyzing their timing in facial behavior. The quantitative measurement achieved by AFA represents a major advance over manual and subjective measurement without requiring the use of invasive sensors. We envision to use AFA's reliable, valid, and efficient measurement of emotion expression and related nonverbal behavior for assessment of symptom severity in depression. Current methods of clinical assessment of depression depend almost entirely on verbal report (clinical interview and/or questionnaire). They lack systematic and efficient ways of incorporating behavioral observations that are .strong indicators of depressive symptoms, especially those related to the timing of dyadic interaction between clinician and patient, much of which may occur outside the awareness of either individual. AFA is capable of extracting both the type and timing of nonverbal indicators of depression. Our hypothesis is that quantitative measures of the configuration and timing of facial expression, head motion, and gaze obtainable by AFA will improve clinical assessment of symptom severity and evaluation of treatment outcomes when combined with information from interviews and self-report questionnaires. We propose to test this hypothesis in 40 participants participating in a treatment intervention study for major depression. Interview, questionnaire, and video data will be collected at regular intervals over the course of treatment. To measure social dynamics, both patient and interviewer will be video recorded and processed using AFA. Longitudinal multilevel modeling will be used to test study hypotheses. We will improve further algorithms and capabilities of AFA to meet evaluation goals and prepare AFA for use by the scientific and clinical community.         n/a",Facial Expression Analysis by Image Processing,7049026,R01MH051435,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'emotions', 'face expression', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'interpersonal relations', 'statistics /biometry', 'videotape /videodisc', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2006,480876,0.07272509102499246
"FACIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS BY IMAGE PROCESSING   DESCRIPTION (adapted from investigator's abstract): Facial expression provides       sensitive cues about emotional response and plays a critical role in the             regulation of interpersonal behavior.

"Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal describes a project to systematically investigate the facial components, combinations of components, and interactions of components that constitute facial expressions (nonmanual markers) in the grammar of American Sign Language (ASL). Some of these components have already been shown to differ in significant ways from those used by the general hearing population. They may carry semantic, prosodic, pragmatic, and syntactic information that may not be provided by the manual signing itself. We will compile an inventory of facial articulations, construct a database of video images of these in isolation and in context, and use these data and innovative computational tools to construct a model of facial behavior in ASL. To successfully accomplish this, we propose an innovative integrated linguistic and computational approach to the study of nonmanuals. Our goal in this project is to construct an initial phonological model of ASL nonmanuals. We have targeted a relevant set of facial features and have identified 4 experiments to obtain appropriate information on each of them. A necessary step in preparation for these experiments is to develop computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms that automatically extract these facial features from a large quantity of videos. These algorithms will be capable of processing data more accurately and efficiently than can be done by hand. Finally, by comparing these results with those obtained from native ASL signers in a series of perceptual studies, we can determine what further modifications are still needed. The study of facial expressions in ASL has very practical applications to several areas affecting the lives of Deaf individuals. The absence of clear information on the facial components makes teaching them to individuals trying to learn ASL, such as parents, deaf children, future teachers and interpreters, a pedagogical nightmare. Another important practical application is the development of systems that automatically recognize ASL. Such a system is not feasible without the ability to handle ASL nonmanuals, which carry grammatical information.         n/a",Modeling the Nonmanuals in American Sign Language,6733239,R01DC005241,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'communication behavior', 'communication disorder aid', 'computational biology', 'computer data analysis', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'face expression', 'human subject', 'information systems', 'paralinguistic behavior', 'phonology', 'semantics', 'sign language', 'video recording system', 'videotape /videodisc']",NIDCD,PURDUE UNIVERSITY WEST LAFAYETTE,R01,2004,499766,0.082234832370391

"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9920230,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'automated analysis', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,676651,0.07527247483254261
"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,9864102,R01MH116042,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Boston', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'outpatient programs', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,847935,0.03564485354217916
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome,10023944,R01MH119185,"['22q11.2', '3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Rhinometry', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ear', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nasal cavity', 'Neurobiology', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Cortex', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oral cavity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Societies', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdeletion', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory sulcus', 'precision medicine', 'psychotic symptoms', 'resilience', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,740401,0.1315386807162101
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9912818,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'shared database', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,581743,0.03149418242370056
"Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB) The introduction of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) has transformed the standard of care and elevated treatment outcome goals for young individuals experiencing the initial stages of a psychotic illness (EP). The response to treatment for EP individuals receiving CSC, however, remains highly variable. A substantial proportion show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices comprising this treatment model. Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond to treatment and published data show that expert clinicians perform no better than chance. Early identification of treatment non-responders has very high clinical significance and would inform and enhance clinical decision making during the first few months of care. Surprisingly, little research has been conducted on baseline predictors of treatment outcomes in EP individuals entering CSC. During the past two decades, considerable progress has been made using neuroimaging to investigate pathophysiological processes during the early phases of illness. Furthermore, limited data suggest that fMRI measures of brain activity and PET measures of increased dopamine synthesis are related to treatment outcomes in EP. We have recently demonstrated in a moderately large sample of EP patients entering CSC that the ability to activate the frontal parietal (FP) cognitive control network (measured using fMRI during the AX- CPT task) is a significant predictor of who will meet responder criterion after one year of CSC. We propose to replicate and extend this result by examining the predictive ability of this and two other promising MRI based measures linked to pathophysiological processes related to psychosis: 1) free water diffusion tensor imaging (FW) - a putative biomarker of neuroinflammation that is increased in EP individuals, and 2) midbrain neuromelanin (NM) scans, which index midbrain dopamine, shown to be decreased in Parkinson's disease and increased in schizophrenia. Each of these measures will be used individually to predict responder status for EP participants entering CSC. In addition to these analyses we will use novel deep learning methods to optimize the prediction of treatment response in EP individuals entering CSC and to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying these effects. Our goal is to leverage recent progress in the development of MRI based imaging biomarkers to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform treatment decision making for all patients in order to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness. A substantial proportion of early psychosis EP individuals show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices provided by coordinated specialty care (CSC). Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond and who will not. In this project we will leverage recent progress in the development of pathophysiologically informed MRI based imaging biomarkers along with novel computational image analysis, to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform clinical decision making to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness.",Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB),10060889,R01MH122139,"['Adjuvant', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clozapine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'indexing', 'ineffective therapies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuromelanin', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'psychosocial', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,757956,0.04591730063954181
"Cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of distressing psychotic-like experiences in childhood and adolescence Project Summary Research has yet to understand why some with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs; early markers of psychosis risk) transition to psychosis spectrum disorders whereas others report only transient PLEs. This information will be critical for understanding the etiology of psychosis spectrum symptoms and for prevention and intervention efforts for this major public health concern (~90% of individuals with significant PLEs report mental health diagnoses in adulthood). According to the expanded proneness-persistence-impairment (PPI) model, potential distinguishing factors between transient PLEs and those transitioning to psychotic disorders is whether they are sustained and distressing (i.e., sustained dPLEs). Consistent with NIMH Strategic Objective 2, this K23 application will fill critical missing gaps in the literature by characterizing the key risk factors and clinical significance of early sustained dPLEs. The application will focus on ~11,800 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study initially aged 9-11-years-old followed annually over the course of the award. The analyses will test PPI model hypotheses, including investigating the most important factors distinguishing sustained from transient dPLEs, examining neurobiological correlates (e.g., resting state functional connectivity, cortical thickness, cognitive functioning), family history of psychosis, motor and speech developmental delays, and environmental predictors (adverse childhood experiences, cannabis use; Aim 1). Models will also test whether longitudinal changes in cognitive, neural predictors, and environmental risk factors distinguish sustained versus transient dPLEs (Aim 2). Lastly, the application will also fill a critical research gap by examining the clinical significance of sustained dPLEs, examining the social and educational functional impairments, treatment seeking behavior, and conducting additional data collection when the youth are ages 16 to 18 to assess the base rates of attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) among youth endorsing sustained dPLEs (Aim 3). To assess rates of APS, the applicant and a masters-level clinician will interview a subset of ABCD participants (n=500) and their parents/caregivers using the Structured Interview of Prodromal Syndromes. Overall, the applicant will implement rigorous practices, including running all analyses for the aims and hypotheses outlined below on two-thirds of data and then replicating the exact same models on an untouched one-third of data. Under the mentorship of a diverse team of experts of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology, longitudinal analyses, machine learning, and neuroimaging analyses, this scientifically rigorous proposal will test hypotheses regarding cross- sectional and longitudinal predictors of sustained versus transient dPLEs for the future application of early identification and preventative interventions. The application addresses several gaps in the applicant’s training that are critical for success as an independent clinical investigator, including the need for further training in advanced statistical techniques (e.g., machine learning, longitudinal analyses, neuroimaging analyses) and increased exposure in the area of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The current application will make important advances in understanding the nature of early markers of risk for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, otherwise known as psychotic-like experiences. Specifically, we do not yet understand why some individuals go on to develop more severe forms of psychotic-like experiences (i.e., sustained distressing psychotic-like experiences) and why for some individuals these experiences are transient. The current application will make significant strides in understanding the most important factors (such as family history and cognition) distinguishing sustained from transient distressing psychotic-like experiences, as well as understanding the clinical importance of these symptoms (including how many individuals with sustained distressing psychotic-like experiences seek treatment or have problems in school or at homes as a result of these symptoms).",Cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of distressing psychotic-like experiences in childhood and adolescence,10054751,K23MH121792,"['11 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Occupational', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Sustainable Development', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Youth', 'adverse childhood events', 'aged', 'attenuated psychosis syndrome', 'base', 'career', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'structured data', 'success', 'theories']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,162963,0.05288231176547395
"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning. PROJECT NARRATIVE Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype that provides important information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. This study utilizes a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach coupled with longitudinal multimodal MR imaging and neurocognitive assessment in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry and cognition along a continuum from healthy controls to SPD (in the SZ spectrum but not fully psychotic) to SZ (psychosis).

"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9942277,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'supervised learning', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,658144,0.09441035914319121
"Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP) 1. Abstract We propose to create a NIMH P50 ALACRITY Center that develops the collaborations, data systems, and methods necessary to form a state-wide Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research, aka the LEAP Center. While recent trial evidence suggests great promise for coordinated specialty care (CSC) for patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), there remain several gaps in the knowledge base for the care of psychosis in general. Now is an ideal time to address these gaps because of recent policy changes enhancing FEP care financing, practice changes in the field, and methods developed outside of mental health. To create this Center, we will start with interdisciplinary collaborations between CSC clinics in Massachusetts, policy makers/regulators, and stakeholders, and include FEP experts from across the country plus scientific experts from outside of mental health, e.g., in data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and health policy. We also will leverage recent Massachusetts efforts to mandate, standardized, and support data collection on FEP care structures, delivery, and outcomes from all FEP clinics within the state. We also will apply and develop modern methods for clinical prediction and comparative effectiveness research (CER), e.g., machine learning and g-methods, for FEP research. Accordingly, we have three overall Center aims: 1) Collaborations; 2) Data systems; and 3) Prediction and CER methods. The Center will start with three foundational and complementary projects: 1) Using the state All Payer Claims Database (APCD), Project 1 will apply a population-level approach to examine which patients receive care in FEP clinics offering CSC versus elsewhere, as the number of clinics increases, then estimate the treatment effect on unfavorable clinical event rates such as hospitalizations; 2) Project 2 will review the data collected by the state from all of the FEP clinics, assess and improve data collection quality, validate measures, and integrate perspectives; and 3) Project 3 will define clusters of patients using longitudinal outcome data (i.e., begin to unpack the amount of clinical heterogeneity), predict the cluster type for individual patients, and examine the impact of CSC treatment accounting for this clinical heterogeneity. The Administrative Core and Methods Core (Prediction and CER) bind these projects together. The Center will include a group of Scientific Advisors from across North America, Center Faculty from diverse scientific disciplines, including those that historically have had little exposure in mental health research, and Stakeholders, including policy makers, organizational decision makers, and patient and family advocates. All three groups will be deeply involved in the Center from design to dissemination. The overall goal is to create a state-wide learning health system for early psychosis. This effort to create the protocols and apply the methods necessary to convert large amounts of data into useful clinical and policy knowledge will inform other national efforts, e.g., NIMH’s EPINET. Project Narrative Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are common illnesses with serious, negative effects on patients and families; fortunately, recent studies suggest that early coordinated treatment might help mitigate some of these adverse effects. There remain many questions, however, about the disease course and treatment options, including what treatments will work best for which patients. This Center will be dedicated to addressing these questions by bringing together leading clinicians and scientists, and creating the systems needed to conduct studies to provide guidance to patients, families, and clinicians in the future.",Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP),9928111,P50MH115846,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adverse effects', 'Advocate', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Community Outreach', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education and Outreach', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Information Systems', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'North America', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'data harmonization', 'data quality', 'design', 'faculty community', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'web site']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,P50,2020,1704908,0.04568426002175723
"2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML historical analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and predicators;Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk,9978241,R01MH120088,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,377685,0.10613650654809324
"Neurocomputational Approaches to Emotion Representation Maintaining an adaptive balance of emotions is central to well-being, and dysregulated emotions contribute broadly to clinical disorders that impart high personal and societal burdens. Recognizing the transdiagnostic importance of emotion to mental health, the National Institute of Health's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix contains overarching domains of Negative Valence, Positive Valence, and Arousal. However, the matrix underspecifies how specific affective states like sadness, anxiety, or craving are organized within and across these domains, in part because it is unknown whether representations of discrete emotions are reliably differentiated. Other RDoC constructs, such as rumination and worry, modify the temporal parameters of emotions that confer psychopathology risk and exacerbate symptom maintenance. Nonetheless, it is unknown how these processes interface with emotional brain circuits to impact affect dynamics, particularly as they often occur spontaneously during mind wandering. The proposed research promises to improve the RDoC depiction of these emotion-related constructs by taking an affective computing approach. During combined recording of psychophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), adult participants will experience emotions to vignettes and movie clips spanning the arousal and valence dimensions, and will report on their spontaneous emotions during resting-state fMRI scans. Machine learning algorithms will decode emotion- specific signals across the levels of analysis, which will be integrated using Bayesian state-space modeling. An analysis of classifier errors will test competing predictions from emotion theories regarding the optimal structure of affective space. Using graph theoretic tools, we will characterize the neural network architecture of the discrete emotion representations to identify provincial and connector hubs that can be used as novel targets for future symptom-specific or co-morbid neuromodulation interventions, respectively. We will apply the emotion-specific maps to resting-state data from the same participants to create neurophysiological indices of spontaneous emotions and to relate their frequencies to measures of trait and state affect as a validation step. Using stochastic modeling of the resting-state data, we will derive temporal dynamics metrics to test the hypothesis that rumination and worry promote emotional inertia during mind wandering. Finally, we will use existing data repositories to demonstrate that our novel indices of affect dynamics transdiagnostically differentiate resting-state fMRI activity patterns in mental health disorders from healthy controls. The proposed research will improve upon current RDoC formulations of Negative Affect, Positive Affect, and Arousal domains by informing how discrete emotions are organized within and across these domains, by integrating emotion representations across multiple RDoC units of analysis, by informing how rumination and worry impact neurophysiological signatures of spontaneous emotions, and by establishing the clinical utility of computationally-derived metrics of emotion dynamics. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall goal of this project is to characterize how emotions are represented in the brain and autonomic nervous system. Computational modeling approaches will be applied to integrate the data across multiple sources and tasks, to test competing theories about how emotions are organized, and to derive new metrics of emotion dynamics. The outcome of the work will inform how emotions should be conceptualized within a broader research framework of mental health domains.",Neurocomputational Approaches to Emotion Representation,10059052,R01MH124112,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'movie', 'negative affect', 'neural network architecture', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,774444,0.049402927868948045
"1/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of ProdromE Risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years.

"Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use ABSTRACT: The use of prescription amphetamines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has markedly increased in the last fifteen years, with the greatest increase in adolescents and young adults. In 2007, the FDA mandated changes to stimulant labels to warn of increases in psychosis and mania in patients without pre-existing conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team from Brigham and Women's Hospital and McLean Hospital recently published a landmark cohort study demonstrating an increased risk of psychotic episodes in new users of amphetamine compared to methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Alarmingly, the use of amphetamines increased four-fold over the study period (2004 – 2015). In addition, our data show that prescription amphetamine use has dramatically increased in patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate knowledge about prescriber-level factors, patient-level factors and disease states that potentiate the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines. Large-scale studies using real-world data are the only option to study the risk of infrequent and serious adverse outcomes. In Aim 1, using incident-user cohort study designs, we will utilize data from two national administrative claims databases to identify prescriber dosing strategies that increase the risk of first-episode psychosis in ~220,000 adolescents and adults with ADHD initiating amphetamines. We hypothesize that there will be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of psychosis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify patient subgroups at heightened risk of psychosis/mania with prescription amphetamine use. To accomplish this goal, we will perform a case control study using electronic medical records (EMR) from McLean Hospital in ~1,650 patients hospitalized for an initial episode of psychosis or mania compared to ~3,300 controls with a first psychiatric hospitalization for reasons other than psychosis or mania. We will apply natural language processing to unstructured narrative notes to capture detailed patient data not available in claims data. We hypothesize that patients with a family history of psychiatric illness will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without a family history. We also hypothesize that patients with concurrent cannabis use will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without cannabis use. Aim 3 compares the risk of treatment-emergent mania in ~52,000 new users of amphetamine versus methylphenidate in a cohort study of patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, an urgent issue given the known risk of mania with stimulant use. Combined, these studies will provide actionable evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines with the goal of mitigating the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription stimulants. The proposed research agenda aligns with NIMH Strategic Objective 3.3 “Striving for Prevention and Cure” on testing interventions in real-world practice settings to evaluate the impact of patient- and provider-level factors on clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In recent years, 6.1 million U.S. children and adolescents were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 16 million adults reported past-year use of prescription stimulants. The research team recently found an increased risk of psychosis in new users of prescription amphetamines compared to new users of prescription methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, translating to potentially increased risk of psychosis for thousands of U.S. patients. Therefore, identifying patient subgroups and prescribing practices that increase the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines has enormous public health significance and will guide providers to avoid amphetamines in patients at highest risk, preventing future cases of psychosis and mania.",Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use,9939094,R01MH122427,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Boston', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immigration', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manic', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Modification', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'amphetamine use', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'first episode psychosis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'patient subsets', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'stimulant use', 'treatment risk', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,746678,0.08283932585401196

"Bioethics of syndrome diagnosis using 3D image analysis Project Summary/Abstract This supplement will address the unintended consequences and collateral damage that arise when facial recognition software is used for medical purposes, such as for syndrome diagnosis as in our Facebase-funded project. In Aim 1, we will determine whether the accuracy of this technology varies based on self-reported race, sex and age. In this aim, we examine our existing database for evidence of bias based on self-reported race, sex or age. We further determine the extent to which these variables influence classification performance. To the extent sample sizes allow, we will carry this analysis to the level of specific syndromes. Finally, we will use anonymized reference datasets of non-syndromic faces to compare false positive rates based on NIH race definitions, sex and age. The outcome of this aim is to objectively establish bias and estimate the effects of under-representation across race, age and sex categories within our data. In Aim 2, we will determine how the reports of race-, sex- and age-based bias in facial recognition technology may influence views of the technology and its application amongst researchers and clinicians. This aim will establish the extent to which the storing of large databases of facial images and the application of machine learning processes to them for diagnostic purposes may raise privacy concerns. The concerns investigated will include potential hacks into protected health information; fear relating to the bias in some facial recognition software (and, potentially, in the Facebase database); and fear of discrimination in the application of the technology, such as by insurers. The outcome will be a white paper that targets a high-profile journal, summarizing the findings and defining crucial issues that should guide the development of facial imaging for disease diagnosis and clinical usage. Project Narrative Our supplement application will address the important question of unintended consequences and collateral damage when facial recognition software is used for medical purposes, such as for syndrome diagnosis as in our Facebase-funded project. The use of large facial recognition databases in medicine represents a frontier that arrives with tremendous potential but undeniable risks. Our central aims are: (1) determine whether the accuracy of this technology varies based on self-reported race, sex and age; and (2) determine how the reports of race-, sex- and age-based bias in facial recognition technology may influence views of the technology and its application amongst researchers and clinicians.",Bioethics of syndrome diagnosis using 3D image analysis,10132648,U01DE028729,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age', 'Authoritarianism', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioethics', 'Biometry', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computational Biology', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Journals', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient imaging', 'Performance', 'Privacy', 'Private Sector', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Sector', 'Race', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'craniofacial', 'disease diagnosis', 'facial recognition software', 'frontier', 'human data', 'intervention cost', 'new technology', 'professor', 'repository', 'sex', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2020,152200,0.032849132524858604
"Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center The “clinical high risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome is an antecedent period characterized by attenuated psychotic symptoms that are marked by subtle deviations from normal development in thinking, motivation, affect, behavior, and a decline in functioning. Early intervention in this CHR population is critical to prevent psychosis onset as well as other adverse outcomes. However, the presentation of symptoms and subsequent course is highly variable, and there is a paucity of biomarkers to guide treatment development. Thus, to improve predictive models that are clinically relevant, several issues need to be addressed: 1) focusing on outcomes beyond psychosis; 2) taking into account heterogeneity in samples and outcomes; and 3) integrating data sets with a broad array of variables using innovative algorithms to overcome variability across studies. To address these challenges, the proposed “Psychosis Risk Evaluation Data Integration and Computational Technologies: Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center” (PREDICT-DPACC) brings together a multidisciplinary team of highly experienced researchers with proven capabilities in all aspects of large-scale studies, CHR studies, as well as computational expertise. The ultimate goal is to identify new CHR biomarkers, and CHR subtypes that will enhance future clinical trials. To do so, the PREDICT-DPACC will 1) aggregate extant CHR- related data sets from legacy datasets; 2) provide collaborative management, direction, data processing and coordination for new U01 multisite network(s); and 3) develop and apply advanced algorithms to identify biomarkers that predict outcomes, and to stratify CHR into subtypes based on outcome trajectories, first from the extant data and then refined and applied to the new data. The PREDICT-DPACC team has the broad, comprehensive, and robust infrastructure that is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the inclusion of multiple data types and to optimally address the needs of the CHR U01 network(s). Carefully selected extant data will be rapidly obtained, processed, and uploaded to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Proposed analysis methods are powerful and robust, leveraging the expertise and experience of computer scientist developers, and experienced clinical researchers. The U01 network(s) will be coordinated by a team that is experienced in managing large studies, familiar with the needs of such studies, flexible, and is knowledgeable in all aspects of CHR studies, including measures, outcomes, biomarkers, and cohorts. Upon meeting the goals of this U24, and the supported U01 network(s), the expected outcomes of the PREDICT-DPACC will be new predictive biomarkers for CHR outcomes, new definitions of CHR subtypes that are clinically useful, and new curated and comprehensive CHR datasets (extant and new) as well as processing tools and prediction algorithms that are shared with the research community through the NIMH Data Archive. NARRATIVE The “Clinical High Risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome in young people represents an opportune window for early intervention to prevent the onset of psychosis and other disorders, and to forestall disability; however, clinical heterogeneity and the paucity of biomarkers have hampered the development of effective intervention. To address these challenges, working with NIMH and key stakeholders, we will harmonize and aggregate existing “legacy” CHR data, and guide and coordinate the collection of new data across a network of sites, to develop biomarker algorithms that can predict individual trajectories for diverse outcomes. This proposal leverages a multidisciplinary team with broad and CHR-specific experience in large-scale multisite and multimodal studies (including clinical trials), along with expertise in data type-specific processing, coordination, analysis, and computational analyses (e.g., machine and deep learning tools from artificial intelligence, and advanced statistical approaches), ethics, community outreach, and data dissemination, all of which will ensure the success of this project.","Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center",10092398,U24MH124629,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality Control', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical tool', 'attenuated psychosis syndrome', 'base', 'bioinformatics infrastructure', 'candidate marker', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical risk', 'clinical subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data archive', 'data dictionary', 'data dissemination', 'data harmonization', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'outcome prediction', 'persistent symptom', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'resilience', 'response', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'working group']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U24,2020,3935239,0.06308357112604875
"Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis ABSTRACT: Psychosis commonly develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Malfunctioning neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, are implicated in the disease progression of psychosis. Changes in brain glutamate in psychosis likely have several sources, as such, many frontline antipsychotic medications indirectly target the glutamate system and alleviate clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, monitoring in vivo alterations of the glutamate system within the brain are spatially limited by traditional magnetic resonance techniques. But, recently a novel 7T MRI technique (GluCEST) has shown that brain glutamate levels are lower across the brain in youth on the psychosis spectrum and patients with schizophrenia as compared to typically developing youth. Here, we propose to extend this novel work to directly measure glutamate within the brain of patients at risk for developing psychosis. Thus, this proposal is motivated by the need to better understand associations of brain neurochemistry, structure and function in both normal development and during early psychosis. In this study, we seek to 1) compare measures of glutamatergic development across the cortex in a cohort of typically developing (TD) youth, those at-clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and individuals with frank psychosis (PSY); 2) associate changes in brain glutamate with age- and diagnosis- related structural network changes in those at risk for developing psychosis; and 3) to establish comparison data of glutamate measures at 7T MRI (1HMRS vs. GluCEST). We will recruit and follow 35 TD, CHR and PSY over the 5-year funding period. Imaging data will be acquired at 7T and analyses will leverage recent advances in network science and machine learning. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of glutamate hypofunction in psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain development, such as disruptions in brain glutamate, during youth produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis,10050152,R01MH120174,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Glutamine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Motor', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protons', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adult', 'frontal lobe', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'trend', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,794181,0.11548046851476242
"Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome Project Summary In the healthy brain, large-scale white matter architecture and local neuronal membrane properties facilitate seamless transitions between cognitive states. Patients with schizophrenia display significant white matter abnormalities with disorganized brain activity. However, the degree to which dysfunctional brain activity in psychosis arises from structural or functional pathology remains unknown. The identification of conclusive neuroimaging findings in this cohort has been challenged by 1) inadequate methods to assess distributed multimodal pathological phenotypes, and 2) the significant pathogenetic heterogeneity in schizophrenia. Practically, the latter challenge can be in part addressed by the study of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS), where the prevalence of clinical schizophrenia is 25-fold higher than that of healthy individuals. The former challenge can be addressed by recent advances in network science and machine learning, which have generated insights about structure-function relationships in the healthy brain. Utilizing these methods to study the spectrum of psychotic symptoms in a population with a defined genetic lesion is a promising direction for investigating psychosis pathophysiology. In this proposal, we describe the development of a novel time-point-based analysis of functional neuroimaging data to study structure-function relationships in a sample of patients with 22qDS currently being seen at the Hospital for the University of Pennsylvania. Using neuroimaging data from a large sample of youths (n = 690) acquired through the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, our preliminary analyses demonstrate previously uncharacterized relationships between brain structure, brain activity, and working memory performance. In this proposal, we aim to 1) compare brain state transition dynamics across the psychotic spectrum of 22qDS, 2) compare structure-function coupling in 22qDS to healthy controls and relate structure-function coupling to psychotic symptom severity, and 3) relate state transition dynamics to working memory performance in 22qDS. A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of psychosis-spectrum symptoms would lay the groundwork for the development of targeted therapies for psychosis. Furthermore, utilizing a cohort with a known genetic lesion provides a unique opportunity to bridge our understanding of molecular mechanisms with neuroimaging biomarkers for psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Project Narrative Targeted, informed therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how complex patterns of brain activity arise from stationary white matter architecture. We propose to apply a novel method based on machine learning and network science to provide a new perspective on structure-function relationships in healthy controls as well as a sample of patients with psychosis secondary to chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Our study will leverage the presence of a consistent genetic lesion in this patient cohort to generate findings that could lay the groundwork for the development of interventions to restore healthy brain dynamics in individuals with psychosis-spectrum symptoms.",Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,9872025,F30MH118871,"['22q11.2', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Occupational', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Direction', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'University Hospitals', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'insight', 'learning network', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'preservation', 'psychotic symptoms', 'regional difference', 'selective attention', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2020,50520,0.06208573652282833
"Outcome-Driven Approach to Minimize the Risks of Facial Distortion Following CMF Surgery Abstract:  Our main clinical motivation of this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with jaw (both maxilla and mandible) deformities by significantly improving surgical planning method. The number of patients suffering from jaw deformities is escalating each year.  Orthognathic surgery is a main surgical procedure to treat jaw deformities by repositioning bony segments of the jaws. The ultimate outcomes of orthognathic surgery are judged by the final facial appearance. Although the facial soft tissues are not directly operated on, the face changes “automatically” following the bony changes. Orthognathic surgery requires extensive surgical planning. While we can accurately plan the bony movements and transfer it to the patient during the surgery using computer-aided surgical simulation (CASS) and 3D printing, surgeons are still unable to practically predict the facial changes during the surgical planning, and just hope that a postoperative normal face will be “automatically” restored. However, this “mental-clue” approach is not reliable because the facial change does not exactly follow bony change. The problem is even bigger in patients with composite defects. For example, if a patient has a skeletal deformity and mild facial defect, a surgeon must know, before surgery, how to overcorrect the skeleton to camouflage the soft-tissue defect. But this information can only be attained by accurate method to predict facial changes. In addition, from patient’s perspective, the final facial appearance is great concern to them. Therefore, it is extremely important, for both doctors and patients, to accurately predict facial changes.  In the previous project period, we have made significant achievements in predicting facial changes following bony movements using finite element (FE) method. However, this approach still requires a considerable amount of time to prepare FE models. In addition, rather than determining the ultimate surgical outcome (the postoperative facial appearance) first, the current method is still to predict the facial change passively following the bony surgery. These hurdles greatly prevent surgeons from practically using it in the clinical setting.  Our hypothesis is that a personalized precision treatment outcome can only be achieved if surgeons are able to determine the final treatment outcome, a desired postoperative face, before planning the bony surgery. To test our hypothesis, we propose to integrate outcome-driven and machine learning-based techniques together to first estimate a desired postoperative face, and then plan the bony surgery.  The proposed project will have a significant clinical impact on improving patient care quality. It will enable clinicians to develop an optimal surgical plan based on both facial and bony information, on-the-fly, using a single software in their routine clinical practice. It will also revolutionize the surgical planning technique using outcome- driven approach, i.e., to first estimate a desired postoperative face and then plan the bony surgery. Project Narrative: 1. In the US and throughout the world, the number of patients requiring orthognathic surgery for jaw  deformities, which involves skeleton, overlying soft tissue, or both, is escalating every ear. 2. Currently, while surgeons are able to accurately plan orthognathic surgery by virtually repositioning bony  segments to desired locations, they are still unable to practically predict the ultimate treatment outcomes  of orthognathic surgery, a desired postoperative facial appearance, during the surgical planning. 3. We are proposing to integrate outcome-driven and machine learning-based techniques together to first  estimate a desired postoperative face, and then plan the bony surgery, which will revolutionize the  surgical planning technique and enable clinicians to develop an optimal surgical plan based on both facial  and bony information, on-the-fly, using a single software in their routine clinical practice.",Outcome-Driven Approach to Minimize the Risks of Facial Distortion Following CMF Surgery,9895393,R01DE021863,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lip structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mandible', 'Maxilla', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Planning Techniques', 'Postoperative Period', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of Care', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Skeleton', 'Slide', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'design', 'improved', 'learning network', 'orthognathic', 'personalized care', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'risk minimization', 'skeletal', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'treatment planning', 'virtual surgery']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,682604,0.02994253184503095
"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,9889183,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data fusion', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,698402,0.05413333448880711
"Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, “real world” emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration—inference based on naturalistic emotion information—likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically “weight” cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues—such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment—that track observers’ use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region “signatures” of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers’ cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new—and more naturalistic—approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will use methods from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science to (i) precisely model people’s inferences about others’ emotions based on complex, dynamic cues, (ii) generate multi-region, brain-based predictors of these inferences, and (iii) characterize abnormalities in inference among individuals with mood disorders. Several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by difficulties understanding others’ emotions, which in turn worsen social functioning in patients. In addition to providing new insights about social processes—a core target within the NIMH’s research domain criteria (RDoC) framework—the proposed research will offer powerful, novel computational and neural targets through which to assess and treat difficulties in emotion inference, and to eventually reduce the social burden faced by people with mental illness on a broad scale.",Computational and brain predictors of emotion cue integration,9923725,R01MH112560,"['Affect', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Observer Variation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Social Psychology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'executive function', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'social', 'social deficits', 'tool']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,451783,0.05844621115320791
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9938687,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'social factors', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2020,710639,0.0702960946240178
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia.

"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.  Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and present treatment only works for a limited number of patients. In order to identify new therapeutic targets, we will longitudinally characterize the underlying pathologies in those with poor treatment response using complimentary brain imaging modalities.",Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients,9840512,R01MH113800,"['Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine Antagonists', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Protons', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Risperidone', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'aripiprazole', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain abnormalities', 'cingulate cortex', 'drug development', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'longitudinal design', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'new therapeutic target', 'patient subsets', 'response', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,816340,0.0727002966903807
"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview- based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,9984613,R01MH120089,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'metropolitan', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,572946,0.09334896744103159
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis,9898476,K23MH116130,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Israel', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'computational basis', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'economic cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal course', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'responsible research conduct', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'smart watch', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2020,191000,0.04183751448932532
"Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis Project Summary: Brain networks linking the cortex to thalamus are critical for cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning. Dysruption of thalamocortical networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychosis, and mechanisms of clinical phenotypes, especially cognitive impairment. This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks. The availability of several large-scale cross-sectional datasets containing multi-modal neuroimaging data and extensive phenotypic data on healthy and at-risk individuals has created an unprecedented opportunity to address these critical knowledge gaps. They include the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN: n=656, ages 18-88); Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI- RS: n=932, ages 6-85); Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset (PING: N=1239, ages 3-20); Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC: n=1601, ages 8-21), which includes psychosis spectrum (PS) youth; and the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS: n=397). Building on our prior work in clinical populations and leveraging the considerable resources of these datasets, we propose to chart the development of thalamocortical networks in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and youth with PS symptoms (Aim 2), characterize the associations between thalamocortical biomarkers and cognition (Aim 3), and investigate the clinical utility of thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers at identifying atypical brain development in individual subjects across the psychosis continuum and predicting conversion to psychosis in clinical high risk individuals (Aim 4). The proposed Aims will: 1) establish critical normative lifespan development data for refining and testing etiological models of not just psychosis, but other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as aging- related disorders; 2) inform the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders and contribute to dimensional models of psychosis; 3) help define the neural basis of executive cognitive abilities thereby providing the necessary foundation for mechanistic models of normal cognitive function and cognitive impairment in psychosis; and 4) potentially provide risk biomarkers and intervention targets for youth at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Public Health Relevance: Many psychiatric disorders emerge between childhood and early adulthood, a period when the brain is undergoing significant developmental changes, and are associated with cognitive impairment which leads to lifelong limitations in psychosocial functioning. Determining how and when premorbid brain development goes awry, clarifying the neural basis of cognitive impairment, and establishing the clinical utility of brain-based biomarkers at predicting illness onset in individuals at high risk for neuropsychiatric illness are essential to developing targeted interventions that prevent the onset of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.",Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis,9893033,R01MH115000,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'symptomatology', 'young adult']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,392508,0.05872968722322455
"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,9840518,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'childhood adversity', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,573248,0.07110931109487927
