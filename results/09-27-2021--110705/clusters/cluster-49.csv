"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9789060,R21MD012693,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Telemedicine', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Underserved Population', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'automated analysis', 'care delivery', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trend', 'two-dimensional']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,94263,-0.005274344196110733
"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction. Aim 4 is to evaluate our similarity framework for predicting 1) the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in general EHR patient population and 2) the risk of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The project focus on developing a novel data science pipeline which includes a clinical data processing pipeline to format comprehensive patient health determinants from a variety of sources of clinical, genomic, socioenvironmental data, and a clinical-outcome-prediction framework that optimally fuses relevant patient health determinants to define patient similarity for improved clinical risk predictions.",Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction,9687065,R01LM013061,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'computerized data processing', 'data modeling', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'health data', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'vector']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,448622,-0.024254830787207343
"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary With newly available electronic health data and a massive increase in processing power, data-driven personalized medicine is just now becoming possible.1 However, advances to improve health care are inherently limited by data quality. One of the most used sources of data, the patient problem list, is also the greatest source of data inaccuracy. According to recent studies, the patient problem list is often less than 50% accurate in documenting the most critical conditions.2 3 4 5 These errors exacerbate inefficiencies throughout the American health care system from care delivery to quality improvement. Primary care physicians rely on problem lists to develop transitional treatment plans for the 68 million Americans who change providers every year. Errors related to care transitions harm more than 1.5 million people each year in the United States, costing the nation an estimated $3.5 billion annually.6 Population health efforts, a cornerstone of value-based healthcare, rely on problem lists to determine risk levels and deployment of resources. These efforts cannot succeed if the source data produce faulty results. This application seeks to enable better individual patient care, enhanced population health management, and effective downstream analytics by building an automated problem list builder, which provides an accurate and granular account of the patient’s medical conditions. If the program is successful, one of the greatest technical risks in value-based healthcare will be addressed. Phase I exceeded success criteria in proving feasibility of core modules in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence. Based on Phase I success, implementation pathways are demonstrated through pilots with one of the largest US healthcare systems and one of the largest global biotechnology firms. The team is comprised of commercial and academic leaders in the field of NLP-based products applied to value-based healthcare. Project Narrative VMT proposes to use advanced semantic technologies and artificial intelligence to enhance the individualized patient problem list, which frequently has 50% or lower accuracy for common conditions such as cancer, smoking, and heart failure. 1 2 3 The problem list represents source data in care delivery, population health, shared-risk contracting, and research.

"Automated Knowledge Engineering Methods to Improve Consumers' Comprehension of their Health Records PROJECT SUMMARY  Today, more patients can access their health records online than ever before. However, clinical acronyms hinder patients' comprehension of their records and decrease the benefits of transparency. An automated system for expanding clinical acronyms should have major clinical significance and far-reaching consequences for improving patient-provider communication, shared decision-making, and health outcomes. Existing systems have limited power to expand clinical acronyms, primarily due to the lack of comprehensiveness (or generali- zability) of existing acronym sense inventories. Because developing comprehensive sense inventories is difficult, existing knowledge engineering methods have primarily focused on developing institution-specific sense inventories. Institution-specific sense inventories may not be generalizable to other geographical regions and medical specialties. Furthermore, developing an institution-specific sense inventory at every US healthcare organization is not feasible, especially without automated methods which currently do not exist.  I developed advanced knowledge engineering methods to overcome these limitations through the use of fully automated techniques to generalize existing sense inventories from different geographical regions and medical specialties. My methods leverage the extensive resources already devoted to developing institution- specific sense inventories in the U.S., and may help generalize existing sense inventories to institutions without the resources to develop them. Although promising, challenges remain with the optimization and evaluation of these methods. The objective of the proposed project is to use knowledge engineering to improve patients' comprehension of their health records, focusing specifically on clinical acronyms. In Aim 1, I will develop new knowledge engineering methods to facilitate the automated integration of sense inventories, using literature- based quality heuristics and a Siamese neural network to establish synonymy. I will evaluate these methods using multiple metrics to assess redundancy, quality, and coverage in two test corpora with over 17 million clinical notes. In Aim 2, I will evaluate whether the knowledge engineering methods improve comprehension of doctors' notes in 60 hospitalized patients with advanced heart failure. With success, I will create novel, automated knowledge engineering methods that can be directly applied to improve patient care. This research is in support of my mentored doctoral training at Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) under Drs. David Vawdrey, George Hripcsak, Carol Friedman, Suzanne Bakken, and Chunhua Weng, and will include coursework on deep learning, oral presentations at major annual conferences, and career development planning, among other activities. DBMI is frequently recognized as one of the oldest and best programs of its kind in the world, and provides an exception training environment for my development into an independent and productive academic investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical acronyms make it difficult for patients to understand their medical records, decreasing the benefits of transparency.

"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,9819327,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,512304,0.008844368144573341
"Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings Project Summary (Abstract) With little change in incidence for over 50 years, pneumonia remains the top cause for morbid hospitalization1 in the USA, and is associated with healthcare costs exceeding $10 billion annually2. This study proposes to mine big data captured in an intergrated medical/dental record (iEHR) and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) of a large midwestern medical-dental integrated healthcare system and will test the hypothesis that poor oral health is an independent risk for subtypes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Proposed specific aims include: 1) electronic identification and characterization of pneumonia types and 2) evaluation of the association of oral health status with risk of pneumonia. Tasks to achieve study aims are to: a) develop electronic, phenotype-based algorithm(s) to classify and characterize pneumonia by subtype and relative frequency of events; b) characterize impact of immediate and longitudinal oral health status on emergent pneumonia stratified by subtype; and c) evaluate relative risk contributed by medical and dental factors. Innovative application of natural language processing (NLP) to support evaluation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML) to identify as-yet unknown potential risk factors is proposed. These aims will be accomplished by established investigators including dentists and researchers with extensive research track records in oral and systemic health including pneumonia, clinical pulmonologist/intensivist to provide clinical expertise to inform data mining, biomedical informaticians with expertise in data mining, ML and NLP and data modeling, and experienced biostatisticians who will apply appropriate statistical approaches and traditional data modeling to big data. This team will collaboratively create and deliver a unique, well-defined, pneumonia- specific, oral health data registry resource and validated phenotype-based algorithm to classify pneumonia, stratified by subtypes, which will support future interrogation for additional permutations of medical and dental factors. Study outcomes are expected to leverage immediate translational value within the health system with high potential for relevance and portability to other settings. The project is expected to define risk factors which may represent actionable targets for reduction of pneumonia risk across various settings. Project Narrative- Relevance to public health: Pneumonia continues as a leading public health problem in hospitals, healthcare facilities and community settings. Pneumonia is the top disease-related cause for hospitalization. This study proposes to use data in electronic health records to classify pneumonia type and describe risk factors that may make individual susceptible to different types of pneumonia, including impact of diseases of the mouth, gums and teeth. The project expects to create models that can identify patients at risk for pneumonia based on information in their medical record so that those risks may be recognized and reduced.",Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings,9784789,R03DE027020,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Climate', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental Records', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nosocomial pneumonia', 'Oral', 'Oral health', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Periodontitis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal vaccine', 'Pneumonia', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Ventilator', 'Visit', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'case finding', 'clinically relevant', 'community setting', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outreach', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'pneumonia model', 'portability', 'secondary analysis', 'systems research', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia']",NIDCR,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R03,2019,159914,-0.008494919694938477
"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers. Through SPEEDe, we will develop an innovative machine- learning approach for accurately detecting adverse events in the elderly in real-time.",Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe),9711286,R01AG062499,"['Active Learning', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'detector', 'forging', 'hands-on learning', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'user centered design']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,802341,0.016759700387695253
"Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases PROJECT SUMMARY  Care delivery at primary and urgent clinics is critically hindered by doctor shortage, time constraints and the inappropriate use of infrastructures. Rising aging population and unhealthy lifestyle are expected to drive the increase of chronic disease and the national health expenditures associated (20% of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025). Telemedicine has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce the cost of access to care minimizing the dependence of patients on health professionals. However, current solutions that connect patients with doctors don’t allow accurate diagnosis due to the lack or inappropriate use of medical devices. AdviNow proposes to implement computer vision to offer a clinically reliable approach to perform self- evaluation of vital parameters. AdviNow will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms that will guide any non-trained people to a correct usage of Class 2 medical devices at the point of need. The new approach will represent the core component of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) which will be integrated into telemedicine platforms, kiosks or any medical office to automate medical visits, improving chronic diseases management.  In this Phase I application, we will develop a minimally viable application based on heart stethoscope exams, in order to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach for multiple medical devices to effectively monitor chronic diseases. Specific activities will include: (1) Development of AR-driven engine for the correct application of heart stethoscope; (2) development of a basic front-end application for Real-time instructions; (3) establishment of a classifier for heart sound abnormalities. We expect to achieve real-time (<300ms) estimation of phonocardiogram key points and accurate validation of the stethoscope position based on camera-capture and audio-recorded data. We expect that our system will recognize normal and abnormal heart sounds with >85% accuracy. Finally, a small feasibility test will be performed with healthy volunteers to verify their ability to position the stethoscope in less than 10 seconds with an error of less than one inch.  The successful completion of this SBIR Phase I project will lay the foundation of a Phase II SBIR proposal for an external validation of the system to be performed in collaboration with urgent care clinics and patients affected by chronic heart conditions. The mission of AdviNow Medical is to develop a disruptive solution for the delivery of healthcare that is safe, effective, timely, efficient, and available in centralized and decentralized locations. By reducing the time for routine analysis, the actual doctor-patient encounter will be more meaningful, improving the clinical outcome as well as patient satisfaction. This invention promises to disrupt healthcare, as providers will improve cost management and profitability by visiting more patients.

"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9782996,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,348107,0.026033147594214857
"Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 5-10% of hospitalized patients suffer significant clinical deterioration after admission, resulting in either transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) or a ""code"" event (i.e., cardiac or pulmonary arrest). Delayed identification of these events result in increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, existing prediction models result in multiple false alarms for every true positive alarm that they generate. In addition with every passing year, new monitoring systems are introduced that generate more false alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue which has been associated with patient deaths. The objective of this mentored career development proposal is to develop and assess novel computational algorithms that can predict the clinical deterioration of hospitalized patients earlier and more accurately than clinicians or conventional early warning systems, thereby allowing for timely intervention. Building upon our experience in the hematologic malignancy subpopulation of hospitalized patients, this new effort: 1) provides a foundation upon which to combine newer machine learning (ML) methods and clinical informatics to improve the capabilities of the model for an individual patient or specific subgroup; 2) assesses the impact and value of different variables from the electronic medical record (EMR) as part of the predictive model; and 3) broadens the evaluation of this approach to additional real-world patient populations, enabling insight into the translation of the models to clinical usage. The specific aims of this project are thus: Specific Aims Aim 1 To identify and extract model variables (features) from the EMR, evaluating different feature selection  methods to optimize different predictive criterion and their impact on ML algorithms. Aim 2 To develop an ML approach that handles multiple asynchronous data streams of longitudinal  information from the EMR, providing predictions on clinical deterioration in real-time. Aim 3 To explore clinician and rapid response team responses to early prediction of clinical deterioration. With successful completion of this proposal, the prediction model will be integrated into the EMR system. Future direction as part of a R01 proposal will involve external validation at other institutions and assessment of clinical impact on patient care. Relevance to Public Health Clinical deterioration in the hospital is often unexpected and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, with the CDC reporting 17.2 million hospital admissions through the emergency department in 2010 suggesting that approximately 1 million people annually are at risk of clinical deterioration during their hospitalization. Existing early warning systems have not been able to accurately predict these events without creating an overwhelming amount of additional false positive alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue and potential harm. Our project, utilizing machine learning techniques with the large amount of available clinical data, will serve to develop a predictive model that can predict clinical deterioration earlier with a higher positive predictive value than current algorithms/models which, when implemented, will be able to provide hospitalized patients with an additional safety net.",Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System,9768542,K01LM012873,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Belief System', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'burnout', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'safety net', 'skills']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2019,205524,0.008456246845376115
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed project aims to make healthcare safer through collection of patient-centered outcomes as the input data to support a safety and improvement model of the Learning Health System (LHS). The project will accomplish these aims by leveraging existing machine learning methods to classify free text documents, such as clinician notes, for the presence or absence of specific events of interest. The project shares this focus with two long-term objectives. The first broad project goal is to collect important data to address knowledge gaps in the incidence and clinical epidemiology of 5 serious pediatric inpatient healthcare acquired conditions (HACs). These 5 HACs are: peripheral IV infiltrates, venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), pressure injuries, patient falls, and incidents involving harm to providers. The second goal is to evaluate a novel approach to routine patient safety event surveillance that is scalable, transferrable, adaptable to other conditions and settings, and with low cost of sustainable ongoing operation. The project has two specific aims to achieve these goals:  Aim 1: Implement enhanced surveillance for 5 pediatric HACs. Compare characteristics  of previously and newly identified cases. Describe high-risk populations.  Aim 2: Estimate completeness of existing systems. Evaluate effects of enhanced  surveillance on quality improvement activities; incidence of HACs; and cost to operate  system, including staff time and resources. The project team has developed a machine learning interface implemented in open license Windows software. The team has a lengthy track record making these methods accessible to clinicians and lay users in research, clinical operations, quality improvement, and injury prevention settings. The current project proposes an innovative application of these technologies, methods, and tools to the important problem of patient safety surveillance. An expected outcome of this project will be substantial advance in knowledge for each of the 5 pediatric HACs proposed for enhanced surveillance. Results will be reported in terms of existing data completeness and clinical epidemiology. Findings will directly address concerns over limitations of existing data sources and thereby drive patient safety improvement activities. An additional expected outcome will be the rigorous evaluation of a novel approach to patient safety surveillance. This will include analysis of the costs and benefits of enhanced surveillance with machine learning versus current approaches, and the cost-effectiveness of the approach compared to reliance on existing data, and external validation at a partner community hospital. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project addresses important challenges to reduce common sources of harm in pediatric healthcare, namely the “Healthcare-Acquired Conditions (HACs)” monitored by the National Solutions for Patient Safety quality improvement initiative. It uses a new approach to identify previously unreported safety events that affect hospitalized pediatric patients. The findings from these studies will identify high-risk patient populations and new approaches for quality improvement to reduce the frequency of these events of harm among hospitalized children.",Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes,9738559,R01HS026246,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,397831,0.011311544410960118
"Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic cigarettes were developed in China in the early 2000s and first introduced to the US market in 2007. Once established in the US, the product experienced explosive growth, with the number of electronic cigarette users doubling every year between 2008 and 2012. In 2012, it was estimated that 75% of US adults had heard of electronic cigarettes, and 8% had tried them. While electronic cigarettes have been studied over the last sev- eral years, no scientific consensus has emerged regarding either the safety of electronic cigarettes, or their po- tential as a smoking cessation aid. With this proposal, we will investigate how electronic cigarette use is documented in the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record, focusing specifically on the relationship between electronic cigarette use and com- bustible tobacco use, with the goal of understanding both how electronic cigarette use is documented in the context of the United States’ only nationwide health system, and how electronic cigarette related information can be reliably extracted from narrative clinical text using fully automated Natural Language Processing meth- ods. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research focuses on the use of Natural Language Processing methods to automatically extract mentions of electronic cigarette use from the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record. The research will provide insight into important, currently unresolved questions regarding how clinicians record electronic cigarette use in the context of a nationwide health system, and whether patients report the use of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid or use the devices in conjunction with combustible tobacco.",Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR,9652537,R03DA047577,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Professional Organizations', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Smoking', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Tweens', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'authority', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic hookah', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'vaping']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2019,76250,-0.024978717987530694
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Atrial fibrillation affects six million US adults, and the prevalence is expected to double by 2030.

"Improve medical decision making in emergency medicine via a new interface to visualize and understand relevant prior history for complex patients at the point-of-care. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Patient Insight is working to drive more informed medical decisions by designing a real-time interface that dynamically captures and presents prior history for complex patients in less time and with more completeness than using their electronic health record (EHR) system. The company is developing proprietary data mining and natural language processing algorithms that show promise for identifying, aggregating, and displaying the most essential EHR data for patients with complex conditions while at the same time working with clinicians to design the visual interface to reduce the cognitive burden and support diagnosis and treatment decisions. The specific goals of this phase I project are to test the feasibility of developing Patient Insight’s core solution to (1) use advanced analytics and natural language processing to mine and prioritize the most relevant information for use by (ED) physicians and (2) develop an clinician-informed, visual display of that essential information to timely support clinical decision-making sufficient to reduce medical errors, improve health, and control costs. In phase I, Patient Insight will work with Universal Health Systems, the parent company of George Washington University Hospital, to co-develop and test the platform for efficacy in the ED as a precursor to continued development of this core solution/product. This will involve using EHR data to assess comprehensiveness to reconstruct history for five groups of chronically ill patients (e.g., advanced cancer, coronary heart disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic pain, and schizophrenia) who are admitted with high-frequency chief complaints of abdominal pain, chest pain, and fever. This will include mining, prioritizing, and presenting information to clinicians using a total of 30 dimensions of data regarding patient’s prior ED and hospital visits including both structured (e.g., diagnosis, medications, labs, imaging test types, EKG date/time) and unstructured data (e.g., images, physician notes, consult notes) to establish physician consensus on the data most valuable to medical decision-making and co-design data visualization tools to render a clear patient history. Our aims include: (Aim 1) Establishing the feasibility of leveraging provider-as-user-centered design to guide development of a data visualization platform that enables providers to readily “see” the most complete patient record for the five groups of complex patients, and (Aim 2) Conducting usability testing and compare the completeness and efficiency of using the enhanced platform on the five patient categories with usual care. Success in phase I will enable the company to validate a ‘proof of concept’ for developing its clinician-as-user-centered design process to inform a phase II research and development effort to design a commercially viable clinical decision support tool for hospitals and health systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patient Insight seeks to determine the feasibility of its proposed platform to aggregate and present the clearest picture possible of a patient’s history for time-constrained emergency department (ED) providers sufficient to drive improved medical decision-making, safety, and improved health outcomes for complex patients at the point-of-care and across disparate EHR systems. The strategy is to leverage our capability to extract discreet and unstructured data from select EHR systems and engage providers in the design of key elements of information display to reduce duplicate testing, lower medical errors related to misinformed treatment choices, and reduce unnecessary treatment and costs. Proving feasibility will enable Patient Insight to structure a partnership with Universal Health Services and inform further development and testing of its core solution across multiple ED facilities.",Improve medical decision making in emergency medicine via a new interface to visualize and understand relevant prior history for complex patients at the point-of-care.,9778547,R43LM013130,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Consult', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cost Control', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intuition', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical History', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Schizophrenia', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Washington', 'Work', 'chronic pain', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive load', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'information display', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'point of care', 'research and development', 'stem', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment choice', 'unnecessary treatment', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NLM,"PATIENT INSIGHT, INC.",R43,2019,155520,-0.027865888855445803
"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety.

The Institute of Medicine and several state legislatures have recommended the use of patient safety event reporting systems (PSRS) to better understand and improve safety hazards. Numerous healthcare providers have adopted these systems, which provide a framework for healthcare provlder staff to report patient safety events. Public databases like MAUDE and VAERS have also been created to collect and trend safety events across healthcare systems. A patient safety event (PSE) report generally consists of both structured and unstructured data elements. Structured data are pre-defined, fixed fields that solicit specific information about the event. The unstructured data fields generally include a free text field where the reporter can enter a text description of the event. The text descriptions are often a rich data source in that the reporter ls not constrained to limited categories or selection options and is able to freely descrlbe the details of the event. The goal of this project is to develop novel statistical methods to analyze unstructured text like patient safety event reports arising in healthcare, which can lead to significant improvements to patient safety and enable timely intervention strategies. We address three problems: (a) Building realistic and meaningful baseline models for near misses, and detecting systematic deterioration of adverse outcomes relative to such baselines; (b) Understanding critical factors that lead to near misses & quantifying severity of outcomes; and (c) ldentifylng document groups of interest. We will use novel statistical approaches that combine Natural Language Processing with Statistical Process Monitoring, Statistical Networks Analysis, and Spatio-temporal Modeling to build a generalizable toolbox that can address these issues in healthcare. An important advantage of our research team is the involvement of healthcare domain experts and access to frontline staff, and we will leverage this strength to develop our algorithms. A key feature of our work is the generalizability of our methods, which will be applicable to biomedical documents arising across a remarkable variety of areas, such as patient safety and equipment malfunction reports, electronic health records, adverse drug or vaccine reports, etc. We will also release open source software via R packages & GitHub, which will enable healthcare staff and researchers to execute our methods on their datasets. Estimates of preventable adverse events in healthcare are staggering, despite the frequently cited Institute of Medicine (IOM) report that first brought attention to the problem over ten years ago. Identifying temporal trends and patterns in the data is particularly important to improving patient safety and patient care. Using our algorithms to effectively analyze documents from reporting systems has the potential to dramatically improve the safety and quality of care by exposing possible weaknesses in the care process.",Collaborative Research: Statistical algorithms for anomaly  detection and patterns recognition in patient care and safety event reports    ,9914443,R01LM013309,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment Malfunction', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Interest Group', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Report (document)', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'hazard', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'spatiotemporal', 'trend']",NLM,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2019,279001,0.01739732940858268
"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,9792242,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2019,1308373,-0.0071610204278607995
"Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events The frequency of diagnostic errors in emergency departments (ED) is largely unknown but likely to be significant. There is a compelling need to create measurement methods that provide diagnostic safety data to clinicians and leaders who in turn can act upon these data to prevent diagnostic harm. Electronic trigger (e- trigger) tools mine vast amounts of clinical and administrative data to identify signals for likely adverse events and have demonstrated capability to identify diagnostic errors. Such tools are more efficient and effective than other methods and can reduce the number of records requiring human review to those at highest risk of harm.  In prior work, we used rules-based e-trigger algorithms to identify patterns of care suggestive of missed or delayed diagnoses in primary care and inpatient settings. For instance, a clinic visit followed several days later by an unplanned hospitalization could be indicative of potential problems with the diagnostic process at the clinic visit. We also proposed a knowledge discovery framework, the Safer Dx Trigger Tools Framework, to enable health care organizations (HCOs) to develop and implement e-trigger tools to measure diagnostic errors using comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) data. Review and analysis of these cases can uncover safety concerns and provide information on diagnostic process breakdowns and related contributory factors, which in turn could generate learning and feedback for improvement purposes.  Sophisticated techniques from machine learning (ML) and data science could help inform ‘second generation’ e-trigger algorithms that better identify diagnostic errors and/or harm than rules-based e-triggers that require substantial manual effort and chart reviews. In contrast to rules-based systems, ML techniques could help learn from examples and accurately retrieve charts with diagnostic error without the need for “hand crafting” of an e-trigger. We will apply e-triggers to comprehensive EHRs that contain longitudinal patient care data (progress notes, tests, referrals) that provide an extensive picture of patients’ diagnostic journeys. Using national VA data, including data from 9 million veterans, and data from Geisinger health system, a pioneer HCO that serves approximately 3 million patients, we propose the following aims: Aim 1 – To develop, refine, test, and apply Safer Dx e-triggers to enable detection, measurement, and learning from diagnostic errors in diverse emergency department (ED) settings. We will calculate the frequency of diagnostic errors in the ED based on these e-triggers and describe the burden of preventable diagnostic harm. Aim 2 - To explore machine learning techniques that yield robust, accurate models to predict diagnostic errors using EHR-enriched data derived from expert-labeled patient records containing diagnostic errors (from Aim 1).  To our knowledge this is the first ML application in diagnostic error measurement, which could help scale up expert-driven e-trigger development and refinement. Newly developed e-triggers can be pilot tested and implemented at other HCOs, enabling them to create actionable safety-related insights from digital data. Narrative The process of making a diagnosis in emergency departments can be vulnerable to error. To study the risks involved, we will develop strategies to better identify electronic medical records of patients who may have had a diagnostic error in their care. We will test the use of human-derived rule-based algorithms and data-driven machine learning methods that can more accurately and efficiently identify these medical records than other currently available methods used in measurement of patient safety.",Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events,9938114,R01HS027363,[' '],AHRQ,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,496121,-0.004194929555654217
"Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS Project Summary Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions to date. They are, however, pharmaceutical products that carry risks. Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine- preventable illnesses. The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains up to 30,000 reports per year over the past 25 years. VAERS reports include both structured data (e.g., vaccination date, first onset date, age, and gender) and unstructured narratives that often provide detailed clinical information about the clinical events and the temporal relationship of the series of event occurrences post vaccination. The structured data only provide one onsite date whereas temporal information of the sequence of events post vaccination is contained in the unstructured narratives. Current status –While structured data in the VAERS are widely used, the narratives are generally ignored because of the challenges inherent in working with unstructured data. Without these narratives, potentially valuable information is lost. Goals - In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Specifically, built upon the state-of-art ontology and natural language processing technologies, we will develop and validate a Temporal Information Modeling, Extraction and Reasoning system for Vaccine data (TIMER-V), which will automatically extract post-vaccination events and their temporal relationships from VAERS reports, semantically infer temporal relations, and integrate the exacted unstructured data with the structured data. Furthermore, we will provide and maintain a publicly available data access interface to query the new integrated data repository, which will facilitate vaccine safety research, casual inference, and other temporal related discovery. We will also develop and validate models to predict severe AEs using the co-occurrence or temporal patterns of the series of AEs post vaccination.

"SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization A growing body of research has found that patients who actively manage their health have better outcomes, and patient engagement has become a central tenet in recent healthcare approaches. However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to en9age patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient's level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective. Our transformative pilot work on physician and nurse documentation has identified an additional obstacle to the effective flow of information from professionals to patients: vocabulary differences between physicians and nurses. By leveraging the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, we found no common synonyms between physician and nurse documentations for 75% of patients. Further, 86% of terms patients use are simple compared to only 15% for physicians. The lack of common language among patients, physicians and nurses motivates including all perspectives to make instructions meaningful for patients. Our hypothesis is that a better informed patient population who understands the connections between their illness, hospital experience, and discharge instructions will be more empowered and more engaged in their chronic disease management. Our innovation is to automatically create an easy-to-understand, personalized hospitalization summary that integrates events described in the EHR; and that is responsive to the patient's needs and preferences, and their activation framework (PAF) level. We pursue four specific aims: 1. To investigate socio-cultural patterns of patient perceptions of illness via a socio linguistic analysis of patient interviews; 2. To integrate multi-faceted information about a patient, as provided by physicians and nurses; 3a. To develop MyPHA, a novel application program, which will automatically generate the personalized summaries and deliver them to the patient on a tablet. MyPHA will be informed by aims 1 and 2, and will be grounded in Natural Language Generation technology; 3b. To evaluate MyPHA with multiple cycles of formative evaluation with all stakeholders, and a summative evaluation with patients. Whereas our pilot work has focused on heart failure, the techniques we will develop can easily be adapted to the management of other chronic health conditions, in particular for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. In addition, cancer and heart failure can co-occur, especially in older patients, and several cancer treatments can lead to the development of heart failure. The software program MyPHA will be released open source to the research community to enable rapid customization to other chronic conditions. Patients who are engaged in their self-care have better outcomes, however discharge instructions often fail to activate them. This study plans to integrate nurse and physician documentation from the Electronic Health Record with the patient's needs and preferences to provide patients with a concise summary of their hospitalization, tailored to their current activation level. This contextual information should help improve the lives of patients living with chronic health conditions, such as cancer patients and survivors.",SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization,9748454,R01CA225446,"['Adherence', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Chicago', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Libraries', 'Medical Records', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Participant', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer therapy', 'cardiogenesis', 'college', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health literacy', 'hospital readmission', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'metathesaurus', 'natural language', 'novel', 'older patient', 'open source', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'patient portal', 'preference', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'social', 'sociolinguistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'urban school']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,363081,-0.013632170112660373
"Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK Abstract Thousands of medical researchers around the world use VTK —the Visualization Toolkit— an open-source, freely available software development toolkit providing advanced 3D interactive visualization, image processing and data analysis algorithms. They either use VTK directly in their in-house research applications or indirectly via one of the multitude of medical image analysis and bioinformatics applications that is built using VTK: Osirix, 3D Slicer, BioImageXD, MedINRIA, SCIRun, ParaView, and others. Furthermore, VTK also provides 3D visualizations for clinical applications such as BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system and Zimmer’s prosthesis design and evaluation platform. VTK has been downloaded many hundreds of thousands of times since its initial release in 1993. Considering its broad distribution and prevalent use, it can be argued that VTK has had a greater impact on medical research, and patient care, than any other open-source visualization package.  This proposal is in response to the multitude of requests we have been receiving from the VTK medical community. The aims are as follows:  1. Aim 1: Adaptive visualization framework: Produce an integrated framework that supports  visualization applications that balance server-side and client-side processing depending on data size,  analysis requirements, and the user platform (e.g., phone, tablet, or GPU-enabled desktop).  2. Aim 2: Integrated, interactive applications: Extend VTK to support a diversity of programming  paradigms ranging from C++ to JavaScript to Python and associated tools such as Jupyter Notebooks,  integrating with emerging technologies such as deep learning technologies.  3. Aim 3: Advanced rendering, including AR/VR: Target shader-based rendering systems and AR/VR  libraries that achieve high frame rates with minimal latency for ubiquitous applications that combine  low-cost, portable devices such as phones, ultrasound transducers, and other biometric sensors for  visually monitoring, guiding, and delivering advanced healthcare.  4. Aim 4: Infrastructure, Outreach, and Validation: Engage the VTK community and the proposed  External Advisory Board during the creation and assessment of the proposed work and corresponding  modern, digital documentation in the form of videos and interactive web-based content. Project Narrative The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software library for the interactive display and processing of medical images. It is being used in most major medical imaging research applications, e.g., 3D Slicer and Osirix, and in several commercial medical applications, e.g., BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system. VTK development began in 1993 and since then an extensive community of users and developers has grown around it. However, the rapid advancement of cloud computing, GPU hardware, deep learning algorithms, and VR/AR systems require corresponding advances in VTK so that the research and products that depend on VTK continue to deliver leading edge healthcare technologies.

"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9693333,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,646418,-0.015646714548010938
"CPS: AutoWean: Foundations of Autonomous Medical CPS for Mechanical Ventilation Weaning   While mechanical ventilators provide life-saving respiratory support, prolonged acute mechanical ventilation (PAMV) can lead to severe complications (e.g. , pneumonia) and increased healthcare costs - predicted to be over $32 billion in 2020 and accounting for over 10% of all hospital costs. Thus, mechanical ventilation needs to be discontinued as early as possible, often by using a process known as ""weaning"". However, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy, where estimated 170,000 preventable deaths per year in US intensive care units are a result of inappropriate ventilator weaning. Consequently, the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) lists improper ventilator settings as a Top 10 Health Technology Hazard in 2019.  Autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning exemplifies a medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) that requires collections of interconnected medical devices (e.g., ventilators and patient monitors) that are coordinated for treating a patient (i.e. , performing safe autonomous weaning). This proposal aims to develop fundamental advances in safe and effective data-driven context-aware human-in-the-loop control that will enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning . While closed-loop control and data-driven techniques (e.g., system identification and machine learning) have been applied to MCPS, assuring the safety and reliability of using data-driven components that adapt in-the-loop with a human operator remains a challenge. We will demonstrate the impact of our closed-loop design and analysis techniques in autonomous MCPS for mechanical ventilation weaning .  The proposed project directly aligns with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) through the research and development of new technologies to advance medical care through medical device interoperability and clinical decision support for enabling autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning. Also relevant to the NIBIB mission, achieving the aims of this project requires a multidisciplinary approach and complementary advances in computer science and clinical care. From the healthcare perspective, this project will offer evidence-based and personalized decision support to caregivers for better mechanical ventilation weaning. The long-term impact of autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning pain will lead to shorter hospital stays, reduce the economic burden of health care, and reduce the deadly side effects of inappropriate weaning. This project concerns development of technologies to quantify and enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning , where, currently, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy.

"Quantitative Modeling Software with Applications to Medical Decision Making Project Summary/Abstract In recent years, health care systems and health care providers have made concerted efforts to practice evidence based medicine to provide patients with the best available information when making choices about their medical decisions. However, these decisions are often complex with many uncertainties and potential outcomes – some beneficial others dire. A popular tool used to help identify best treatment strategies is a decision tree, which outlines a patient's potential outcomes given an initial medical choice. Complex decision trees are evaluated via Monte Carlo microsimulation to trace a patient's path through the tree. This movement is inherently stochastic because outcomes are probabilistic; however, when the microsimulation is repeated many times, it provides the probability of each associated outcome resulting from the initial medical decision. From this probability distribution, quantitative measures associated with each medical decision can be calculated including beneficial as well as adverse events, life years, quality-adjusted life years (a generic measure of disease burden), and others. When outcome costs are known and incorporated into the model, cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) can be used to readily compute the relative costs, effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness for each health outcome. We propose to add functionality to the mathematical modeling software Berkeley Madonna to allow users to build decision trees and carry out Monte Carlo microsimulations on these trees (Aim 1). Berkeley Madonna's interface was designed to gently introduce students from non-technical fields into mathematical modeling by using a simple syntax and graphical images to construct sophisticated equations. We will leverage this easy-to-use interface to introduce medical researchers to microsimulation. The software will be adapted to build decision trees with built-in functions and customized graphics specific to this field, including measures from CEA. Patients moving through a decision tree using microsimulation must be simulated hundreds of thousands to millions of times to arrive at statistically significant outcome probabilities, and these simulations are computationally intense often requiring months of computer time. We will harness the power of graphics processing units (GPUs) to parallelize these simulations to achieve tremendous speedups compared to commercially available software, which have not taken advantage of these hardware capabilities. We show that a simple Monte Carlo microsimulation can be simulated 700x faster on a GPU compared to a CPU, and we will optimize the code to fully realize these speedups when simulating complex decision trees (Aim 2). Successful completion of our goals will provide a powerful research tool to the medical decision making field, which will positively impact health outcomes research. We expect that our software will be particularly beneficial to the cardiovascular research community, which has a history of practicing evidence-based medicine that includes simulation modeling. Project Narrative This proposal will expand the functionality of the mathematical software Berkeley Madonna to perform medical decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis using microsimulation. We will implement GPU-accelerated algorithms to dramatically increase calculations speeds, which will far outpace current industry standards. Successful completion of our goals will provide a powerful and user-friendly piece of software that will allow cardiovascular and other medical researchers to more easily construct and simulate decision models, which will positively impact health outcomes. 1",Quantitative Modeling Software with Applications to Medical Decision Making,9774898,R43LM013133,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost Measures', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Equation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Explosion', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Simulation', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost outcomes', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'health economics', 'incremental cost-effectiveness', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'models and simulation', 'programs', 'relative cost', 'simulation', 'stem', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'undergraduate student', 'user-friendly']",NLM,"BERKELEY MADONNA, INC.",R43,2019,326600,0.014098271464473565
"Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign Project Summary/Abstract Written The objective of the proposed research is to reduce the patient safety hazards associated with electronic medication administration records (eMARs) by, (1) understanding current usability and safety gaps, and (2) creating design and development documents, wireframes, and prototypes to serve as the foundation for future eMARs that will eliminate these gaps. In particular, we focus on communication and information flow challenges between nurses, pharmacists, and physicians during medication administration and use of the eMAR. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-16-009). We will develop a broad understanding of usability and safety hazards associated with eMARs by analyzing a large dataset of 1.7 million patient safety event reports and detailed medication error related narratives. We will then conduct heuristic analyses of current eMARs, and interviews and observations of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. These data will serve to inform the development of eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes as the foundation for future development. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health information technology (health IT), informatics, and data science. Our research team includes physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and human factors engineers, and experts in natural language processing. In addition, our partnerships include a patient safety organization and a health IT vendor. The proposal addresses fundamental aspects of the call for proposals by providing new insights on the safety of health IT and improves current practices by developing use cases and new prototypes for immediate use by healthIT vendors. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the role of health IT during medication administration with a focus on communication and information flow, design, development and testing documents for vendors and providers, and eMAR wireframes and prototypes to improve development. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with medication related test scenarios to assess current health IT systems. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health because it applies the sciences of human factors and informatics to improve the usability and safety of the electronic medication administration records (eMARs), which will ultimately improve patient care. Patient safety event report data will be analyzed to identify usability and safety hazards in eMARs, and interviews and observations will be conducted to identify clinician needs. Based on this knowledge eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes will be developed, tested, and disseminated with the goal of improving communication and information flow to reduce medication related errors.",Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign,9731456,R01HS025136,[' '],AHRQ,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,399999,0.02613460130521629
"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,9938134,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,497444,0.019491694232708832
"Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project PROJECT SUMMARY Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are important in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a condition that affects 1.3 million Americans and is a leading cause of disability. Among chronic conditions, RA has many decades of robust scientific evidence around the validity of PROs. PROs are key outcome measures in RA clinical trials and studies, are responsive to therapy changes, are strong predictors of future disability and mortality, and play a central role in facilitating shared decision-making and treatment. Advances in health information technology (IT), like electronic health record-enabled Qualified Clinical Data Registries (QCDRs), provide an opportunity to scale and spread of use of PRO measures nationally. The Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) registry is a QCDR that was established in 2014 to improve the quality of care for patients seen in rheumatology practices. The RISE informatics platform aggregates electronic health record data from participating practices, analyzes these data centrally and feeds performance on quality measures back to clinicians using a web-based dashboard. RISE currently includes one the largest PRO measurement efforts for ambulatory patients with a chronic disease in the United States. However, as the registry matures, several critical gaps remain in our national PRO measurement efforts, including the lack of representation of public hospital systems and at-risk populations, the challenges faced by some practices in creating structured data fields in electronic health records to capture PRO measure scores, and the need to evaluate the impact of the PRO collection efforts through RISE. The overarching goal of this proposal is to systematically address each of these issues by 1) creating an evidence-based clinical learning network to support the participation of public hospital systems in PRO measurement and improvement efforts through RISE, 2) developing and scaling a natural language processing system to extract PRO measures from unstructured data in clinical notes, and 3) analyzing the impact of PRO measurement through RISE on quality of care and health outcomes in RA. This proposal builds on the novel informatics platform of the RISE registry to scale, spread and evaluate PRO implementation across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices, with the ultimate goal of improving functional status outcomes for those with RA. PROJECT NARRATIVE The RISE-PRO project aims to use the novel health IT platform of the RISE patient registry to scale, spread and evaluate the collection of patient-reported outcomes across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices. Collecting and using patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice has the potential to transform health care for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis by making care more patient-centered and by providing tools to facilitate shared decision-making, disease monitoring, and population health management.",Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project,9735244,R18HS025638,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R18,2019,494501,-0.0059917889635371655
"Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems V (CAHPS V) Consumers, providers and health care purchasers need high-quality information to help them compare and evaluate their health care options. The CAHPS V project will advance the AHRQ CAHPS mission of improving patients' experiences with health care by developing and evaluating strategies for survey measurement, reporting and quality improvement (QI). We propose a 5-year effort to advance the science and practice of patient experience assessment, continue innovation to ensure relevance to health service delivery and implement best survey practices, further the science of reporting, and evaluate CAHPS QI efforts. We will develop program communication strategies, and disseminate and promote use of CAHPS products. In particular, we will develop a survey to assess patient experiences with end-of-life care; develop new items to assess shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety; test alternatives to the standard CAHPS modes of data collection), explore the feasibility of administering a short-form survey dividing CG-CAHPS composites among respondents to reduce response burden, elicit stakeholder feedback about the value of different CAHPS supplement item sets, evaluate “The Your CAHPS Survey” that was designed to help users of the CAHPS surveys compile a survey tailed to their specific needs, and evaluate existing Spanish translations of CAHPS surveys. In addition, we will gather input from stakeholders on best practices for narrative data analysis, develop an approach for using automated Natural Language Processing for analyses of narratives, and construct an algorithm approach to select representative narratives that reflect and illustrate overall provider ratings. Finally, we will evaluate the contribution of patient narratives to quality improvement efforts in hospital care for children, characterize primary care practices use of the CG-CAHPS survey and patient-centered medical home items during PCMH transformation, assess the impact of pay- for-performance for care delivered by primary and specialty care safety net providers on CAHPS survey responses, explore the value of new shared decision-making, patient engagement, communication and patient safety items for QI and identify QI strategies that improve patient experience across various settings. We will also advance analytic methods for CAHPS data. The project team is well suited to achieving the study objectives given its prior accomplishments and established working relationships. The work is innovative and designed to facilitate the use of CAHPS surveys and improve response rates to them, enhance reporting and use of CAHPS survey data, and improve health care QI efforts.

"SUpPress SSI - Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections SUpPress SSI – Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections The proposed work Specific Aim 1 is to evaluate the effect of single-use NPWT on SSI rates after C- section, abdominal hysterectomy, and colon procedures in at risk patients. To address this aim, we will conduct a multicenter, stepped-wedge, quasi-experimental trial evaluating use of the PrevenaTM with 125 mm Hg negative pressure for 7 days among obese (BMI >30) and/or diabetic patients undergoing the procedures of interest. This is an effectiveness trial evaluating the effect of single-use NPWT on SSI rates among high-risk patients using a randomized stepped wedge design. Six Epicenter hospitals will be included: University of Illinois Hospital (UIH), University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics (UIHC), University of Utah Hospital (UUH), Emory University Hospital Midtown (EUHM), Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH), and University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC). If proposed improvement in SSI rates are demonstrated this will provide more clear guidance for the use of the NPWT. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate the patients’ experience of using the NPWT. A sub-set of patients will be surveyed to assess their knowledge of post-operative care, to identify complications associated with NPWT use, and to learn how patients evaluated the device’s ease of use, ease of removal, and comfort. This will identify barriers to implementation. Specific Aim 3 is to assess whether real-time decision support through machine-learning modeling can help surgeons identify patients at high risk of SSI who could benefit from NWPT or other post-surgical preventive measures. This will evaluate whether boosted tree modeling techniques can be used “at the bedside” via electronic medical record data feeds to tailor post-operative care and preventive care for specific patients. Participating hospitals will be surveyed to assess their readiness to submit data to the datamart. We will sequentially establish the data feed for each hospital. From the datamart a model will be built for SSIs that could be prevented by the NPWT. In this way, it will refine the predictive value of the model for this specific intervention. The use of this modeling will help provide more personalized care plans for patients at greatest risk of SSI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide data that will give surgeons and hospitals clear recommendations on the use of NPWT for Cesarean section, abdominal hysterectomy and colon surgeries in patients with diabetes and/or obesity.

"VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies. If properly addressed, these factors present tremendous opportunities for improving patient care and outcomes of patients. The overarching goal of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) CCCR is to facilitate advancements in the methodologic sciences supporting clinical research within the NIAMS pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) disease missions.  VERITY is organized around central scientific themes that can be applied to multiple rheumatic and MSK diseases. The Cores address the following cross-cutting areas: 1) including patients in clinical trial design, outcome selection, result interpretation, and dissemination; 2) integrating behavioral economics to enhance benefits of known interventions, i.e., adherence to medications, engagement in physical activity and weight loss; 3) extracting maximum information content from big data; 4) using smart technologies (mobile health) to advance clinical research; and 5) disseminating knowledge and mentoring of local and national rheumatic and MSK disease clinical researchers through distributed learning models. These scientific themes will be approached through several Cores described in the following Specific Aims. 1. To strategically direct, supervise, and provide financial accountability to VERITY and to train a broad group of local and national investigators for patient-oriented clinical research in pediatric and adult rheumatic and MSK diseases. (Administrative Core) 2. To develop and implement state of the art methods in innovative trials and longitudinal comparative effectiveness studies for rheumatic and MSK disease research. (Methodology Core) 3.

"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology.

"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9445485,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'readmission risk', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,376490,-0.026297643455314327
"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9600732,R21MD012693,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Telemedicine', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Underserved Population', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'care delivery', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trend', 'two-dimensional']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,278902,-0.005274344196110733
"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary With newly available electronic health data and a massive increase in processing power, data-driven personalized medicine is just now becoming possible.1 However, advances to improve health care are inherently limited by data quality. One of the most used sources of data, the patient problem list, is also the greatest source of data inaccuracy. According to recent studies, the patient problem list is often less than 50% accurate in documenting the most critical conditions.2 3 4 5 These errors exacerbate inefficiencies throughout the American health care system from care delivery to quality improvement. Primary care physicians rely on problem lists to develop transitional treatment plans for the 68 million Americans who change providers every year. Errors related to care transitions harm more than 1.5 million people each year in the United States, costing the nation an estimated $3.5 billion annually.6 Population health efforts, a cornerstone of value-based healthcare, rely on problem lists to determine risk levels and deployment of resources. These efforts cannot succeed if the source data produce faulty results. This application seeks to enable better individual patient care, enhanced population health management, and effective downstream analytics by building an automated problem list builder, which provides an accurate and granular account of the patient’s medical conditions. If the program is successful, one of the greatest technical risks in value-based healthcare will be addressed. Phase I exceeded success criteria in proving feasibility of core modules in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence. Based on Phase I success, implementation pathways are demonstrated through pilots with one of the largest US healthcare systems and one of the largest global biotechnology firms. The team is comprised of commercial and academic leaders in the field of NLP-based products applied to value-based healthcare. Project Narrative VMT proposes to use advanced semantic technologies and artificial intelligence to enhance the individualized patient problem list, which frequently has 50% or lower accuracy for common conditions such as cancer, smoking, and heart failure. 1 2 3 The problem list represents source data in care delivery, population health, shared-risk contracting, and research.

"Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance PROJECT SUMMARY The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Quality Payment Program is designed to motivate healthcare providers to adhere to best practices in clinical healthcare and patient safety. Unfortunately, extracting quality measures data from the clinical record is burdensome and as such, participation among clinical healthcare providers is suboptimal. Our aim is to develop a system to facilitate automatic extraction of quality data. This will reduce the burden of data collection and help remove the barrier to participation that keeps more providers from participating in the program. The proposed project, titled “Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance”, aims to develop novel natural language processing methods to recognize key elements from the clinical notes to enable proper documentation of meaningful use and compliance with quality payment. We envision this to be an effective research partnership that leverages the complementary assets of SaferMD, a small business unit, and the University of Michigan, a non-profit research institution, to develop and evaluate a prototype tool to extract clinical quality measures data, and increase participation in the Quality Payment Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project, titled “Using advanced natural language processing to facilitate documentation of meaningful use and quality payment compliance”, aims to develop novel natural language processing methods to recognize key elements from the clinical notes to enable proper documentation of meaningful use and compliance with quality payment. The project will develop algorithms to identify fields relevant for quality measures and develop tools to extract and analyze these data elements from large sets of radiology reports. Finally, the proposed work will initiate the extracted measures into existing quality service offerings by SaferMD.

"Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings Project Summary (Abstract) With little change in incidence for over 50 years, pneumonia remains the top cause for morbid hospitalization1 in the USA, and is associated with healthcare costs exceeding $10 billion annually2. This study proposes to mine big data captured in an intergrated medical/dental record (iEHR) and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) of a large midwestern medical-dental integrated healthcare system and will test the hypothesis that poor oral health is an independent risk for subtypes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Proposed specific aims include: 1) electronic identification and characterization of pneumonia types and 2) evaluation of the association of oral health status with risk of pneumonia. Tasks to achieve study aims are to: a) develop electronic, phenotype-based algorithm(s) to classify and characterize pneumonia by subtype and relative frequency of events; b) characterize impact of immediate and longitudinal oral health status on emergent pneumonia stratified by subtype; and c) evaluate relative risk contributed by medical and dental factors. Innovative application of natural language processing (NLP) to support evaluation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML) to identify as-yet unknown potential risk factors is proposed. These aims will be accomplished by established investigators including dentists and researchers with extensive research track records in oral and systemic health including pneumonia, clinical pulmonologist/intensivist to provide clinical expertise to inform data mining, biomedical informaticians with expertise in data mining, ML and NLP and data modeling, and experienced biostatisticians who will apply appropriate statistical approaches and traditional data modeling to big data. This team will collaboratively create and deliver a unique, well-defined, pneumonia- specific, oral health data registry resource and validated phenotype-based algorithm to classify pneumonia, stratified by subtypes, which will support future interrogation for additional permutations of medical and dental factors. Study outcomes are expected to leverage immediate translational value within the health system with high potential for relevance and portability to other settings. The project is expected to define risk factors which may represent actionable targets for reduction of pneumonia risk across various settings. Project Narrative- Relevance to public health: Pneumonia continues as a leading public health problem in hospitals, healthcare facilities and community settings. Pneumonia is the top disease-related cause for hospitalization. This study proposes to use data in electronic health records to classify pneumonia type and describe risk factors that may make individual susceptible to different types of pneumonia, including impact of diseases of the mouth, gums and teeth.

"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9640372,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,347584,0.026033147594214857
"Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives Project Summary Medicine has evolved into an era where the entire hospital progressively adopts more real-time monitoring for the patients and generates ICU like clinical data. The rapidly growing data makes ICU a snapshot for tomorrow’s standard of care that should benefit from computer-aided decision making. These data contain not only numerical or coded information, but also a large volume of unstructured narrative text such as physicians’ and nurses' notes, specialists' reports, and discharge summaries. Both types of data have been shown to be highly informative for tasks such as cohort selection, and work best in combination. However, to achieve this, specific bits of information must be extracted from the narrative reports and coded in formal representation. These bits include medical concepts such as symptoms, diseases, medications and procedures; characteristics such as certainty, severity, dose; assertions about these items, such as whether they pertain to the patient or a family member, etc.; relations among these mentions, including indications of what condition is treated by what action and its degree of success, the time sequence and duration of events, and interpretations of laboratory test results as relations among medical concepts such as cells and antigens (e.g., “[large atypical cells] express [CD30]”). Concepts and assertions can be regarded as simple relations, and our proposal focuses on modeling narrative relations to augment structured data for predicting patient outcomes. Most existing techniques for interpreting clinical narratives either rely on hand-crafted rule systems and large medical thesauri or are based on machine learning models that create classification or regression models from large annotated data sets. The former are difficult and laborious to generalize, whereas the latter require large volumes of human-labeled data and may result in models whose operation is difficult to interpret and is therefore considered unsuitable for computer-aided decision making. We propose to build on our previous work to use unsupervised learning methods that identify frequent patterns in un-annotated narratives and identify informative patterns by tensor factorization. Although existing methods can also identify patterns that are meaningful in a data-driven sense, these patterns are difficult for clinicians to understand. Our specific goal is to develop a novel method that uses a Bayesian generative model that integrates relation mining with tensor factorization to learn patterns that correspond to an understanding of the clinical domain and can be used for evidence based patient outcome prediction. Our framework represents relations in clinical narratives as graphs, then mines subgraphs for important relations. These relations are used as features in building up a tensor model in order to reduce dimensionality, discover coherent groups of relations, and explore the group interactions. We develop Bayesian formulation to integrate relation mining and tensor modeling in a generative model, to incorporate existing medical knowledge as probability priors, as well as to reliably estimate the posterior probabilities and confidence intervals of any findings from the model. Rapid growth in the hospital adoption of large volume of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has led to an unprecedented availability of narrative dataset for clinical and translational research.

"Identifying Electronic Phenotypes associated with Patient Health Outcomes of Interhospital Transfer Patients Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 1.6 million patients undergo interhospital transfer (IHT) each year in the United States. Of those IHTs, approximately 550,000 are conducted by air (i.e., helicopters or jets), or roughly one every 60 seconds, at an estimated annual cost of $6 billion. Contrary to common belief, patients who undergo IHT experience worse outcomes, which include double the length of stay, twice the cost, and higher mortality than non- transferred patients. While worse outcomes are not necessarily due to higher severity of illness, factors contributing to unfavorable outcomes have yet to be identified. For about 30% of the patients experiencing an immediately life-threatening condition such as trauma or heart attack, immediate IHT by air is beneficial; but for the other 70% of patients not experiencing a life-threatening condition, the benefit is less clear.  The current decision-making process regarding who should be transferred and how (air vs. ground) is rarely guided by evidence or guidelines. Furthermore, patients and families rarely have input regarding how a patient is transferred. Empirical evidence is needed to identify meaningful indicators for IHT and to guide the decision regarding mode of transfer. Previous research efforts relied almost exclusively on data from the post- transport phase of illness, a major limitation when investigating what leads up to a patient needing transfer to another hospital. To investigate the factors that lead to IHT, we developed a data repository for patients who are transported from one hospital to another. This repository includes the electronic medical record of helicopter and jet transfers, as well as the sending and receiving hospital EMR data.  The purpose of this study is to model complex patient-centered data that may predict those patients that will benefit from IHT by identifying pre-transport electronic phenotypes, and to determine who will benefit from air versus ground transfer. To fully leverage the data repository, this study will employ a data science approach that leverages statistical learning techniques to achieve the following aims: 1) Identify and rank specific combinations of comorbidities, active medical problems, and physiologic instability indicators according to frequency and impact on post-IHT mortality, and 2) Identify electronic phenotypes of IHT patients that benefit from air transfer according to health outcomes (hospital discharge status and functional status). After conducting exploratory data analysis and reducing variables with repeated measures, we will employ Association Rules to identify significant combinations of covariates to include in final model development (Aim 1). Then in Aim 2 we will use Random Forest to identify the most impactful variables from all of the available variables that will be analyzed via Classification and Regression Tree to identify distinct subgroups of patients that benefit from IHT by air transport. The individual characteristics identified from this data driven approach will provide the evidence needed to support future applications to develop clinical decision support for use by clinicians, patients, and families when making transfer decisions. Project Narrative Air Medical Transport (AMT), the use of helicopters and jets to transfer patients from one hospital to another, has been shown to save lives for patients with immediately life threatening conditions such as trauma or heart attack; for patients not experiencing an emergency, the impact of using AMT and transferring is unknown. To increase our understanding of the impact that AMT has for patients not experiencing an emergency, we will identify the patient characteristics and transport factors that improve patient survival after transport. Our study will be the first to provide evidence to support informed conversations between patients, families, and providers to guide those making the difficult decisions of if and how to transfer to another hospital.",Identifying Electronic Phenotypes associated with Patient Health Outcomes of Interhospital Transfer Patients,9515376,R15NR017792,"['Address', 'Air', 'Behavioral Model', 'Belief', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Helicopter', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'School Nursing', 'Severity of illness', 'Stroke', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'experience', 'faculty support', 'forest', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'member', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'repository', 'support tools']",NINR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R15,2018,150000,0.009748201058611544
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Tailored Drug Titration through Artificial Intelligence Optima Integrated Health Inc. (Optima) proposes to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the decision support technology for medication treatment optimization it validated in a pilot clinical trial, optima4BP. optima4BP is designed as a physician decision/action support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment independent of in-office visits, for patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN). optima4BP is designed to reduce preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of stroke, heart failure (HF) or myocardial infarction (MI) events resulting from high blood pressure (BP) above goal. Uncontrolled HTN affects 34 million Americans. The cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs, with >135 million Emergency Dptm. (ED) visits. optima4BP will improve the quality of life for uncontrolled HTN patients, and reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that emphasizes preventative care through personalized health surveillance, assessment, and action via timely and safely optimized medication treatment. Our specific aims include: Aim (1) demonstrating the efficacy of optima4BP in a randomized clinical trial (n=300 patients) deployed at UC San Francisco Medical Center. Patients will be randomized to an enhanced care (EC) arm or an optima4BP arm (O4BP). All patients will use Omron10 BP arm cuff to remotely measure their BP. For the patients in the EC arm, physicians will be provided with a monthly summary of the Omron10 data. For patients in the O4BP arm, aside from the BP monthly summary, physicians will receive (a) a risk stratified patient roster, (b) next step actions in medication optimization for each patient, and (c) access to optima4BP's secure web-service medication treatment modeling to investigate how changing current patient data could affect medication choice (e.g., change in medication choice if BP goal is lowered). We will then examine the BP value reduction between arms (success:>7 mmHg decreased systolic; >4 mmHg decreased diastolic of O4BP vs. EC), along with secondary outcomes between O4BP and EC: medication treatment action frequency; ED admissions due to HTN-related symptoms and associated hospitalizations for stroke, HF or MI; and overall cost of HTN management. Aim (2) optima4BP data processing steps will be optimized to scale-up its capability to >1000/day patient cases processing power. 3 specific optimization processing tools will be developed: Optima Extract, Transform, and Load (OETL); Optima Survey Generator (OSG), and Optima Message Builder (OMB). OETL will provide streamlined scheduling logic to extracting data from Epic® EMR (electronic medical record), optimize data mapping scripts within optima4BP, and optimize data uploading protocols. OSG will optimize the current generation protocol for patient surveys, patient response, and assignment of patient responses to specific processing modules. OMB will ensure streamlined scheduling of risk stratification updates and scheduled delivery to physician In-Basket messaging system within Epic® EHR. Our goal is to simplify the management of high blood pressure (BP) while improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel surveillance- assessment-medication treatment action artificial intelligence (optima4BP) as a physician decision support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment independent of in-office visits, with the goal of reducing preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of stroke, heart failure or heart attack events.",Tailored Drug Titration through Artificial Intelligence,9494417,R44HL132622,"['Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Office Visits', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Update', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'care coordination', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'health care service', 'health data', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'primary outcome', 'scale up', 'secondary outcome', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'web services']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2018,649649,-0.00927115554585213
"Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 5-10% of hospitalized patients suffer significant clinical deterioration after admission, resulting in either transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) or a ""code"" event (i.e., cardiac or pulmonary arrest). Delayed identification of these events result in increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, existing prediction models result in multiple false alarms for every true positive alarm that they generate. In addition with every passing year, new monitoring systems are introduced that generate more false alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue which has been associated with patient deaths. The objective of this mentored career development proposal is to develop and assess novel computational algorithms that can predict the clinical deterioration of hospitalized patients earlier and more accurately than clinicians or conventional early warning systems, thereby allowing for timely intervention. Building upon our experience in the hematologic malignancy subpopulation of hospitalized patients, this new effort: 1) provides a foundation upon which to combine newer machine learning (ML) methods and clinical informatics to improve the capabilities of the model for an individual patient or specific subgroup; 2) assesses the impact and value of different variables from the electronic medical record (EMR) as part of the predictive model; and 3) broadens the evaluation of this approach to additional real-world patient populations, enabling insight into the translation of the models to clinical usage. The specific aims of this project are thus: Specific Aims Aim 1 To identify and extract model variables (features) from the EMR, evaluating different feature selection  methods to optimize different predictive criterion and their impact on ML algorithms. Aim 2 To develop an ML approach that handles multiple asynchronous data streams of longitudinal  information from the EMR, providing predictions on clinical deterioration in real-time. Aim 3 To explore clinician and rapid response team responses to early prediction of clinical deterioration. With successful completion of this proposal, the prediction model will be integrated into the EMR system. Future direction as part of a R01 proposal will involve external validation at other institutions and assessment of clinical impact on patient care. Relevance to Public Health Clinical deterioration in the hospital is often unexpected and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, with the CDC reporting 17.2 million hospital admissions through the emergency department in 2010 suggesting that approximately 1 million people annually are at risk of clinical deterioration during their hospitalization. Existing early warning systems have not been able to accurately predict these events without creating an overwhelming amount of additional false positive alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue and potential harm. Our project, utilizing machine learning techniques with the large amount of available clinical data, will serve to develop a predictive model that can predict clinical deterioration earlier with a higher positive predictive value than current algorithms/models which, when implemented, will be able to provide hospitalized patients with an additional safety net.",Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System,9504995,K01LM012873,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Belief System', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'burnout', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'safety net', 'skills']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2018,205524,0.008456246845376115
"Evaluating the Impact of Changes in Opioid Prescribing Across Health Systems Implementing Zero Suicide This timely supplement would support our goals for the current award: An Evaluation of the National Zero Suicide Model Across Learning Healthcare Systems (U01MH114087) by capitalizing on a natural experiment, the planned the national roll-out of safety planning templates in behavioral health departments across five Kaiser Permanente regions and Henry Ford Health System in 2019. Safety planning is a highly recommended practice within the Zero Suicide (ZS) framework, but little is known about the effectiveness of the individual elements that can make up a safety plan, such as lethal means assessment, identification of supportive contacts, coping skills, warning signs, and sources of distraction. The current Zero Suicide award proposes to examine the impact of safety planning and lethal means assessment using a stepped-wedged interrupted time- series (ITS) approach, measuring each as a binary variable (e.g. safety planning did or did not occur). The ITS approach requires that some sites implement safety planning (intervention sites for safety planning), while others do not (control sites for safety planning). The proposed ITS approach is now problematic without further work for two reasons: 1) All Kaiser Permanente sites and Henry Ford have decided to uniformly implement safety planning around the same time, therefore there are no control sites 2) Without control sites, metrics that can accurately measure variation in safety planning/lethal means assessment at baseline and then longitudinally thereafter would enable our evaluation to take place, but all of the documentation lives in text- based clinical narratives. In working with our health system leads on the development of Zero Suicide metrics, we have been informed that the rate for safety planning and lethal means assessment at baseline is not zero, but the actual rate is unknown. This supplement will support development of new metrics using Natural Language Processing to determine baseline rates, from which, we can quantify the change in safety planning and lethal means assessment practice longitudinally after implementation of new safety planning templates using our Zero Suicide main award. Furthermore, we propose to take advantage of the newly implemented templates to address an important mediator of the effect of safety planning on suicide outcomes, the impact of fidelity to the new templates, which we define as quality, completeness, and level of integration with ongoing care. We propose the following three specific aims for this supplemental work: 1) Identify key terms for safety planning and lethal means assessment 1.) Develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) metrics to assess the occurrence of safety planning and lethal means assessment at three Zero Suicide sites 2) Implement NLP queries for identification of safety planning and lethal means assessment and measure baseline rates 3) Upon implementation of electronic safety planning templates in medical records, develop and implement metrics using NLP for assessing fidelity (completeness, quality, integration with care) to safety planning templates. Project Narrative: This supplement to the current award: An Evaluation of the National Zero Suicide Model Across Learning Healthcare Systems (U01MH114087) will take advantage of a national roll-out for safety planning templates in the electronic medical record across 5 Kaiser Permanente regions and Henry Ford Health System. It will support the development of innovative measures using natural language processing to efficiently quantify the baseline rates of safety planning and lethal means assessment across multiple sites, which will enable a rigorous evaluation to take place upon implementation of the new electronic templates. Furthermore, we propose to take advantage of the safety planning template roll-out by measuring fidelity (quality, completeness, and level of integration with care), because it may be an important mediator of the relationship between safety planning and suicide outcomes.",Evaluating the Impact of Changes in Opioid Prescribing Across Health Systems Implementing Zero Suicide,9676620,U01MH114087,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colorado', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coping Skills', 'Country', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Firearms', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral outcome', 'design', 'distraction', 'health plan', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'prescription opioid', 'reducing suicide', 'safety practice', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicide model', 'tool']",NIMH,HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM,U01,2018,262124,-0.09483438221722601
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Atrial fibrillation affects six million US adults, and the prevalence is expected to double by 2030.

"Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS Project Summary Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions to date. They are, however, pharmaceutical products that carry risks. Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine- preventable illnesses. The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains up to 30,000 reports per year over the past 25 years. VAERS reports include both structured data (e.g., vaccination date, first onset date, age, and gender) and unstructured narratives that often provide detailed clinical information about the clinical events and the temporal relationship of the series of event occurrences post vaccination. The structured data only provide one onsite date whereas temporal information of the sequence of events post vaccination is contained in the unstructured narratives. Current status –While structured data in the VAERS are widely used, the narratives are generally ignored because of the challenges inherent in working with unstructured data. Without these narratives, potentially valuable information is lost. Goals - In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Specifically, built upon the state-of-art ontology and natural language processing technologies, we will develop and validate a Temporal Information Modeling, Extraction and Reasoning system for Vaccine data (TIMER-V), which will automatically extract post-vaccination events and their temporal relationships from VAERS reports, semantically infer temporal relations, and integrate the exacted unstructured data with the structured data. Furthermore, we will provide and maintain a publicly available data access interface to query the new integrated data repository, which will facilitate vaccine safety research, casual inference, and other temporal related discovery. We will also develop and validate models to predict severe AEs using the co-occurrence or temporal patterns of the series of AEs post vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make use of the unstructured narratives in the VAERS reports to facilitate the temporal related discovery to a broad community of investigators in pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, vaccine safety research, among others. Project Narrative Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine-preventable illnesses. In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. Currently the FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) only includes one onsite date in its database. The textual narratives in the reports are generally ignored primarily due to their unstructured nature. These narratives, however, contain more detailed information about the series of events that happened after vaccination, which could be valuable for more informed clinical studies. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Our new methods, their applications to VAERS database, and their dissemination will facilitate the entire research network for pursuing temporal related discovery with high methodological rigor.",Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS,9419767,R01AI130460,"['Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Severe Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'base', 'data access', 'data warehouse', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'information model', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'vaccine safety']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2018,619389,0.016640701846146074
"SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization A growing body of research has found that patients who actively manage their health have better outcomes, and patient engagement has become a central tenet in recent healthcare approaches. However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to en9age patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient's level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective. Our transformative pilot work on physician and nurse documentation has identified an additional obstacle to the effective flow of information from professionals to patients: vocabulary differences between physicians and nurses. By leveraging the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, we found no common synonyms between physician and nurse documentations for 75% of patients. Further, 86% of terms patients use are simple compared to only 15% for physicians. The lack of common language among patients, physicians and nurses motivates including all perspectives to make instructions meaningful for patients. Our hypothesis is that a better informed patient population who understands the connections between their illness, hospital experience, and discharge instructions will be more empowered and more engaged in their chronic disease management. Our innovation is to automatically create an easy-to-understand, personalized hospitalization summary that integrates events described in the EHR; and that is responsive to the patient's needs and preferences, and their activation framework (PAF) level. We pursue four specific aims: 1. To investigate socio-cultural patterns of patient perceptions of illness via a socio linguistic analysis of patient interviews; 2. To integrate multi-faceted information about a patient, as provided by physicians and nurses; 3a. To develop MyPHA, a novel application program, which will automatically generate the personalized summaries and deliver them to the patient on a tablet. MyPHA will be informed by aims 1 and 2, and will be grounded in Natural Language Generation technology; 3b. To evaluate MyPHA with multiple cycles of formative evaluation with all stakeholders, and a summative evaluation with patients. Whereas our pilot work has focused on heart failure, the techniques we will develop can easily be adapted to the management of other chronic health conditions, in particular for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. In addition, cancer and heart failure can co-occur, especially in older patients, and several cancer treatments can lead to the development of heart failure. The software program MyPHA will be released open source to the research community to enable rapid customization to other chronic conditions. Patients who are engaged in their self-care have better outcomes, however discharge instructions often fail to activate them. This study plans to integrate nurse and physician documentation from the Electronic Health Record with the patient's needs and preferences to provide patients with a concise summary of their hospitalization, tailored to their current activation level. This contextual information should help improve the lives of patients living with chronic health conditions, such as cancer patients and survivors.",SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization,9488582,R01CA225446,"['Adherence', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Chicago', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Libraries', 'Medical Records', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Participant', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer therapy', 'cardiogenesis', 'college', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'design', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health literacy', 'hospital readmission', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'metathesaurus', 'natural language', 'novel', 'older patient', 'open source', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'patient portal', 'preference', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'social', 'sociolinguistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'urban school']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,375284,-0.013632170112660373
"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,9568310,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2018,1308227,-0.0071610204278607995
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly.

"How Does Automated Record Linkage Affect Inferences about Population Health? ABSTRACT  Our broad research objective is to create the Longitudinal Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-dataset (LIFE-M) spanning the late 19th and 20th century United States. Using automated record linkage technology, the LIFE-M project combines millions of vital records to reconstruct how and why individuals' health has changed across time. This multi-generational, longitudinal micro-database aims to transform research on health and longevity, on childbearing and family structure, and on the long-run health effects of early-life circumstances and exposures.  In creating LIFE-M, however, we have encountered serious deficits in knowledge about the performance of automated record linkage technology. The proposed project seeks to evaluate the performance of the most popular and cutting-edge automated linking techniques for the purposes of creating longitudinal health data. Our specific aims are to (1) produce systematic evidence regarding the performance of automated record linking algorithms in terms of match rates, representativeness of the linked sample, erroneous matches (type I errors), and systematic measurement error; (2) examine how phonetic name-cleaning methods affect quality metrics; and (3) examine how record quality metrics vary for different underrepresented subgroups (including women, racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrants) and to determine how linking methods affect representativeness and inferences. To achieve these aims, we have developed new partnerships with record linking experts allowing us to incorporate the most cutting-edge methods in record linking. We will also rely on new “ground truth” generated by LIFE-M project's independent, double-blind human review process.  This project will contribute significantly to existing knowledge about the use of automated linking methods for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health data. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in health studies. Both contributions should greatly enhance the quality of descriptive and causal inferences about population health and aging and disparities in these outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by advancing record linking methodology for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health datasets. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in public health and aging studies using linked records.

"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care. Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient. The main idea underlying the approach is that patterns of past EMR usage patterns can be exploited to selectively highlight clinically useful patient data.",Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System,9521586,R01LM012095,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemoglobin', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Provider', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer human interaction', 'data access', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'stem', 'trend', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,452158,0.008408080985097172
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9534365,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2018,449751,0.007177096688978056
"Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign Project Summary/Abstract Written The objective of the proposed research is to reduce the patient safety hazards associated with electronic medication administration records (eMARs) by, (1) understanding current usability and safety gaps, and (2) creating design and development documents, wireframes, and prototypes to serve as the foundation for future eMARs that will eliminate these gaps. In particular, we focus on communication and information flow challenges between nurses, pharmacists, and physicians during medication administration and use of the eMAR. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-16-009). We will develop a broad understanding of usability and safety hazards associated with eMARs by analyzing a large dataset of 1.7 million patient safety event reports and detailed medication error related narratives. We will then conduct heuristic analyses of current eMARs, and interviews and observations of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. These data will serve to inform the development of eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes as the foundation for future development. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health information technology (health IT), informatics, and data science. Our research team includes physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and human factors engineers, and experts in natural language processing. In addition, our partnerships include a patient safety organization and a health IT vendor. The proposal addresses fundamental aspects of the call for proposals by providing new insights on the safety of health IT and improves current practices by developing use cases and new prototypes for immediate use by healthIT vendors. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the role of health IT during medication administration with a focus on communication and information flow, design, development and testing documents for vendors and providers, and eMAR wireframes and prototypes to improve development. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with medication related test scenarios to assess current health IT systems. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health because it applies the sciences of human factors and informatics to improve the usability and safety of the electronic medication administration records (eMARs), which will ultimately improve patient care. Patient safety event report data will be analyzed to identify usability and safety hazards in eMARs, and interviews and observations will be conducted to identify clinician needs. Based on this knowledge eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes will be developed, tested, and disseminated with the goal of improving communication and information flow to reduce medication related errors.",Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign,9447854,R01HS025136,[' '],AHRQ,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,400000,0.02613460130521629
"Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project PROJECT SUMMARY Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are important in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a condition that affects 1.3 million Americans and is a leading cause of disability. Among chronic conditions, RA has many decades of robust scientific evidence around the validity of PROs. PROs are key outcome measures in RA clinical trials and studies, are responsive to therapy changes, are strong predictors of future disability and mortality, and play a central role in facilitating shared decision-making and treatment. Advances in health information technology (IT), like electronic health record-enabled Qualified Clinical Data Registries (QCDRs), provide an opportunity to scale and spread of use of PRO measures nationally. The Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) registry is a QCDR that was established in 2014 to improve the quality of care for patients seen in rheumatology practices. The RISE informatics platform aggregates electronic health record data from participating practices, analyzes these data centrally and feeds performance on quality measures back to clinicians using a web-based dashboard. RISE currently includes one the largest PRO measurement efforts for ambulatory patients with a chronic disease in the United States. However, as the registry matures, several critical gaps remain in our national PRO measurement efforts, including the lack of representation of public hospital systems and at-risk populations, the challenges faced by some practices in creating structured data fields in electronic health records to capture PRO measure scores, and the need to evaluate the impact of the PRO collection efforts through RISE. The overarching goal of this proposal is to systematically address each of these issues by 1) creating an evidence-based clinical learning network to support the participation of public hospital systems in PRO measurement and improvement efforts through RISE, 2) developing and scaling a natural language processing system to extract PRO measures from unstructured data in clinical notes, and 3) analyzing the impact of PRO measurement through RISE on quality of care and health outcomes in RA.

"Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems V (CAHPS V) Consumers, providers and health care purchasers need high-quality information to help them compare and evaluate their health care options. The CAHPS V project will advance the AHRQ CAHPS mission of improving patients' experiences with health care by developing and evaluating strategies for survey measurement, reporting and quality improvement (QI). We propose a 5-year effort to advance the science and practice of patient experience assessment, continue innovation to ensure relevance to health service delivery and implement best survey practices, further the science of reporting, and evaluate CAHPS QI efforts. We will develop program communication strategies, and disseminate and promote use of CAHPS products. In particular, we will develop a survey to assess patient experiences with end-of-life care; develop new items to assess shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety; test alternatives to the standard CAHPS modes of data collection), explore the feasibility of administering a short-form survey dividing CG-CAHPS composites among respondents to reduce response burden, elicit stakeholder feedback about the value of different CAHPS supplement item sets, evaluate “The Your CAHPS Survey” that was designed to help users of the CAHPS surveys compile a survey tailed to their specific needs, and evaluate existing Spanish translations of CAHPS surveys. In addition, we will gather input from stakeholders on best practices for narrative data analysis, develop an approach for using automated Natural Language Processing for analyses of narratives, and construct an algorithm approach to select representative narratives that reflect and illustrate overall provider ratings. Finally, we will evaluate the contribution of patient narratives to quality improvement efforts in hospital care for children, characterize primary care practices use of the CG-CAHPS survey and patient-centered medical home items during PCMH transformation, assess the impact of pay- for-performance for care delivered by primary and specialty care safety net providers on CAHPS survey responses, explore the value of new shared decision-making, patient engagement, communication and patient safety items for QI and identify QI strategies that improve patient experience across various settings. We will also advance analytic methods for CAHPS data. The project team is well suited to achieving the study objectives given its prior accomplishments and established working relationships. The work is innovative and designed to facilitate the use of CAHPS surveys and improve response rates to them, enhance reporting and use of CAHPS survey data, and improve health care QI efforts.

"Automatic Generation of Computer Interpretable Guidelines PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Compliance with clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) has been demonstrated to markedly improve patient care, but the tools and processes available for physicians to rapidly and meaningfully leverage these guidelines are currently sub-optimal. Compliance improves greatly with the introduction of clinical decision support systems (CDSS), which implement guideline recommendations and are integrated into electronic health record (EHR) systems. Unfortunately, CPGs, as commonly distributed, contain recommendations for care of only a single disorder (or class of disorders) and are not easily consumable by computers for integration with CDSS. Recent work has focused on methods to resolve conflicts between guidelines, but only once they are in a computer interpretable form - a Computer Interpretable Guideline (CIG). We aim: to (1) develop a system for computational understanding of CPGs from the unstructured text; (2) to ground the clinical terms in each guideline in its definition so that the produced CIG can better integrate with electronic health record systems; (3) to generate CIGs in a format already developed which allows guidelines to be mediated with each other and allows the creation of CDSS. The project will focus on four clinical guidelines, relating to diabetes, heart disease, non-small cell lung and prostate cancers. Samples of each of the guidelines will be annotated by clinicians with the appropriate output of systems accomplishing each of the three aims. These samples will be split into datasets for testing and for evaluation, with the overall goal to achieve human levels of competence for each aim. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical practice guidelines are paramount to the goals of evidence-based medicine but, being unstructured free text, they are not well integrated with clinician workflows and are not consistently adhered to. We aim to automatically generate computer interpretable versions of textual guidelines in a format which allows for automatic mediation between guidelines for patients with multiple morbidities. Mediated computer interpretable guidelines could then be integrated with electronic medical record systems, providing immediate impact on population health.",Automatic Generation of Computer Interpretable Guidelines,9654971,R15LM013030,"['Belief', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computer generated', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'novel', 'phrases', 'population health', 'prescription procedure', 'syntax', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NLM,COLLEGE AT OSWEGO,R15,2018,325760,-0.004279477795068275
"Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Timely reporting and effective learning from medical incidents is considered an effective way in developing strategies for reducing medical errors. Utilizing an innovative a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach combining with case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques, we propose to develop a knowledgebase and learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, linking historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews on patient safety. We envision that the innovative approach will facilitate timely, quality reporting and learning from the incidents and ultimately cultivating a just and learning culture of patient safety.",Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit,9567932,R01HS022895,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2018,249135,0.04106074004810893
"Developing Evidence for Safety Surveillance from Device Adverse Event Reports Title: Developing Evidence for Safety Surveillance from Device Adverse Event Reports Project Summary/Abstract Population level studies have shown that the device-based hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with increased risks of reoperation during follow-up, when compared to traditional laparoscopic sterilization. However, secondary data sources often lack the granularity to understand the nature of patient and device complications related to the device removal and additional surgery. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database houses medical device reports submitted to the FDA by mandatory and voluntary reporters. These reports contain detailed information of patient and device adverse events. But due to its narrative structure, research with the reports has been limited, partially due to the restrictions of keyword search and manual review. The proposed study will innovatively apply natural language processing (NLP) to analyze MAUDE reports of device removals. NLP is a powerful tool capable of extracting information efficiently from documents such as medical notes, allowing the summarization of thousands of adverse event reports in a cost-effective way. The primary aim is to develop an NLP program to extract and summarize patient- and device-specific complications associated with device removal and additional surgeries following hysteroscopic sterilization. Secondary objective is to evaluate the impact of regulatory activities on adverse event reporting behavior and structure. The hypotheses are that the majority of reported removals were associated with device-related complications as opposed to persistent symptoms only, and that after the FDA convened a panel discussion in September 2015, adverse event reports were more likely to be submitted by mandatory reporters, with improvement in structured presentation. Adverse event reports related to device removal will be selected from the MAUDE database using keyword search first, and 1,000 reports will be annotated and used to develop and validate the NLP tool. Applying the developed NLP to all reports, extracted information will be used for the analysis, and comparisons will be made before and after September 2015. The significance of the proposed research is that it will develop a method to better utilize adverse event reports to obtain crucial device safety information supplemental to regular population-level studies. By achieving this, the long term goal is to create a useful tool for future medical device safety surveillance to understand the nature of adverse events. The immediate next step will be to use the tool to investigate device safety in other areas. The comprehension of the nature of device adverse events and the elucidation of the crucial role of regulatory activity in facilitating reliable adverse event reporting will help promote patient safety evaluation and monitoring. Project Narrative The proposed research will focus on device adverse event reports and develop a powerful tool to analyze reports to understand the nature of patient and device complications related to device removals and additional surgeries. The study will also elucidate the impact of regulatory activities on adverse event reporting. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to part of AHRQ's mission to make health care safer.",Developing Evidence for Safety Surveillance from Device Adverse Event Reports,9586941,R03HS026291,[' '],AHRQ,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R03,2018,96907,-0.008506969766592163
"SUpPress SSI - Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections SUpPress SSI – Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections The proposed work Specific Aim 1 is to evaluate the effect of single-use NPWT on SSI rates after C- section, abdominal hysterectomy, and colon procedures in at risk patients. To address this aim, we will conduct a multicenter, stepped-wedge, quasi-experimental trial evaluating use of the PrevenaTM with 125 mm Hg negative pressure for 7 days among obese (BMI >30) and/or diabetic patients undergoing the procedures of interest. This is an effectiveness trial evaluating the effect of single-use NPWT on SSI rates among high-risk patients using a randomized stepped wedge design. Six Epicenter hospitals will be included: University of Illinois Hospital (UIH), University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics (UIHC), University of Utah Hospital (UUH), Emory University Hospital Midtown (EUHM), Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH), and University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC). If proposed improvement in SSI rates are demonstrated this will provide more clear guidance for the use of the NPWT. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate the patients’ experience of using the NPWT. A sub-set of patients will be surveyed to assess their knowledge of post-operative care, to identify complications associated with NPWT use, and to learn how patients evaluated the device’s ease of use, ease of removal, and comfort. This will identify barriers to implementation. Specific Aim 3 is to assess whether real-time decision support through machine-learning modeling can help surgeons identify patients at high risk of SSI who could benefit from NWPT or other post-surgical preventive measures. This will evaluate whether boosted tree modeling techniques can be used “at the bedside” via electronic medical record data feeds to tailor post-operative care and preventive care for specific patients. Participating hospitals will be surveyed to assess their readiness to submit data to the datamart. We will sequentially establish the data feed for each hospital. From the datamart a model will be built for SSIs that could be prevented by the NPWT. In this way, it will refine the predictive value of the model for this specific intervention. The use of this modeling will help provide more personalized care plans for patients at greatest risk of SSI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide data that will give surgeons and hospitals clear recommendations on the use of NPWT for Cesarean section, abdominal hysterectomy and colon surgeries in patients with diabetes and/or obesity. We also want to understand the patient experience with the dressing so that we can provide information that will enable clinicians to remove barriers to NPWT use. Additionally, we are seeking to use automated electronic medical record decision support to identify patients that will benefit most from the NPWT.",SUpPress SSI - Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections,9659740,U01CK000557,[' '],NCEZID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,U01,2018,941762,0.009286729692792869
"VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies.

"Clinical practice patterns and healthcare resource utilization in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: using real world data to bridge the evidence gap PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This F32 fellowship award will provide Dr. Erica Farrand with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented clinical research in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); (2) to develop a unique skill set in collecting, analyzing and interpreting real-world data; (3) to gain advanced skills in epidemiology, biostatistics and data science methods to conduct clinical research; (4) to advance the IPF field by improving our understanding of the clinical impact of acute exacerbation of IPF. To achieve these goals, Dr. Farrand will conduct clinical investigations in two distinct healthcare systems, the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Health and Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). IPF is a progressive fibrotic lung disease associated with high morbidity and mortality and over $1 billion in healthcare cost annually. Acute exacerbation of IPF, is an acute respiratory deterioration and arguably the most clinically significant event in the natural history of the disease. The fundamental aim of this NRSA proposal is to leverage the electronic health records of UCSF Health and KPNC to generate real-world evidence regarding the epidemiology of acute exacerbation of IPF, the nature and variability of its clinical management and health care utilization across settings, and the impact of common management strategies on clinical outcomes. Research in this fellowship will utilize electronic health record data to define the acute exacerbation population using a case-validated diagnostic algorithm (Aim 1), document the scope and impact of acute exacerbation on clinical practice and healthcare resource utilization, comparing the UCSF and KPNC systems (Aim 2), and determine the association of common management approaches with hospital based and short-term patient-outcomes (Aim 3). This project will demonstrate the power of leveraging high-quality electronic health record data to both advance our understanding of a clinical condition and document the association of treatment interventions with patient and system level outcomes NARRATIVE Episodes of acute respiratory deterioration known as acute exacerbations are the most clinically significant events in the natural history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and limited data exist to guide the management of acute exacerbations of IPF. The impact of acute exacerbations on health care resource utilization across health care settings has not been characterized. Leveraging high-quality real-world data from the electronic health records of two large medical systems, we will address this knowledge gap by defining the clinical impact of acute exacerbation of IPF on the patient and healthcare system level; this work will demonstrate the power of real-world data for clinical research, and lay the foundation for future pragmatic studies of IPF.",Clinical practice patterns and healthcare resource utilization in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: using real world data to bridge the evidence gap,9610527,F32HL143920,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulation', 'Award', 'Bilateral', 'Biometry', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Intensive Care', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Lung diseases', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Management', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'System', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Ventilator', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'comparative effectiveness', 'day length', 'disease natural history', 'effectiveness trial', 'electronic data', 'evidence based guidelines', 'health care service utilization', 'health care settings', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'improved', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'pragmatic trial', 'prognostic', 'prospective test', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'survival outcome']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2018,71077,-0.01730203817828374
"Integrating Patient Photographs with Radiography Studies PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) The objective of this proposal is to implement, assess, and enhance a novel technology that can automatically obtain patient photographs at the point-of-care of medical imaging and thus provide a biometric identifier to prevent wrong-patient errors. Wrong-patient errors in radiology, where one patient's medical imaging study is erroneously placed in another patient's record in the picture archiving and communications system (PACS), can cause serious complications for both involved patients. Despite the use of the Joint Commission mandated dual-identifier technique, wrong-patient errors continue to occur. Patient facial photographs obtained at the point-of-care of medical imaging can serve as biometric identifiers that are easily obtained, intrinsic, yet externally visible and non-obtrusively obtained. Prior work by the investigators has demonstrated that such photographs can significantly increase the detection of simulated wrong-patient errors in pre-clinical observer studies. Competing technologies such as fingerprint identifiers, palm vein mapping or retinal scanning, while using intrinsic identifiers, are obtrusive; other technologies that rely on patient armbands with barcodes, while nonobtrusive, only provide extrinsic identifiers that are not unique to the patient. CameRad Technologies, LLC is developing this technology—the PatCamTM system, with two main components, a camera device and an integration server. The integration server accurately matches the photographs with the correct medical imaging studies and then stores them together in the PACS. In this proposal, CameRad will pursue the following aims to de-risk the technology on the path to commercialization. In Aim 1, the investigators will demonstrate that their technology is vendor-neutral and can operate in a highly secure, controlled environment, by implementing the system at the Veterans Affairs Maryland Healthcare System's (VAMHCS) McKesson PACS. They will then assess whether the technology can increase error detection, decrease interpretation time, and be perceived favorably by radiologists in a clinical setting at VAMHCS. In Aim 2, CameRad will develop an automated system face verification system for flagging potentially misidentified imaging studies for review by humans. Achievement of these aims are critical in preparation for a Phase II SBIR project, which will involve a multi-center clinical workflow study to demonstrate that patient photographs can 1) increase detection of wrong patient errors clinically and 2) increase radiologist interpreter efficiency. Most importantly, the potential future impact of this technology is that it can personalize medical imaging studies thereby increasing the focus of interpreting physicians. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Wrong-patient errors in radiology, where one patient's medical images are erroneously placed in another patient's electronic chart, can cause serious problems for both involved patients. CameRad Technologies, LLC will implement and assess a novel technology that automatically and simultaneously obtains a patient's facial photograph along with each medical imaging examination. These photographs, which act as positive patient identifiers, can significantly increase the detection rate of wrong-patient errors and, at the same time, also decrease the interpretation time of imaging studies since they provide some additional clinical clues about patient status.",Integrating Patient Photographs with Radiography Studies,9564757,R43TR002299,"['Achievement', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Environment', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Information Systems', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Maryland', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Shock', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'University Hospitals', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Vendor', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'demographics', 'experience', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'point of care', 'portability', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'residence', 'simulation', 'technology development']",NCATS,"CAMERAD TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2018,224922,0.014550143214867273
"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with cancer experience significant side effects from their treatments, but these side effects are under- reported on clinical trials and no work has been done to improve the current system of side effect reporting. This study will create a new system of identifying and reporting side effects that is more accurate and efficient than the current system.

"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9254614,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2017,377260,-0.026297643455314327
"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9275458,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,210198,-0.009319495002499468
"Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Supervised machine learning is a popular method that uses labeled training examples to predict future outcomes.  Unfortunately, supervised machine learning for biomedical research is often limited by a lack of labeled data.  Current methods to produce labeled data involve manual chart reviews that are laborious and do not scale with data creation rates.  This project aims to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records by forming a crowd of clinical personnel labelers.  The construction of these labeled data sets will allow for new biomedical research studies that were previously infeasible to conduct.  There are numerous practical and theoretical challenges of developing a crowd sourcing platform for clinical data.  First, popular, public crowd sourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk are not suitable for medical record labeling as HIPAA makes clinical data sharing risky.  Second, the types of clinical questions that are amenable for crowd sourcing are not well understood.  Third, it is unclear if the clinical crowd can produce labels quickly and accurately.  Each of these challenges will be addressed in a separate Aim. As the first Aim of this project, the team will evaluate different clinical crowd sourcing architectures.  The architecture must leverage the scale of the crowd, while minimizing patient information exposure.  De-identification tools will be considered to scrub clinical notes t reduce information leakage.  Using this design, the team will extend a popular open source crowd sourcing tool, Pybossa, and release it to the public.  As the second Aim, the team will study the type, structure, topic and specificity of clinical prediction questions, and how these characteristics impact labeler quality.  Lastly, the team will evaluate the quality and accuracy of collected clinical crowd sourced data on two existing chart review problems to determine the platform's utility. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traditionally, clinical prediction models rely on supervised machine learning algorithms to probabilistically predict clinical events using labeled medical records.  When data sets are small, manual chart reviews performed by clinical staff are sufficient to label each outcome; however, as data sets have scaled up and researchers aim to study larger cohorts, current manual approaches become intractable.  The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records to support prediction model development.",Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research,9270528,UH2CA203708,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Audit', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Research', 'Medical Students', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Privacy', 'Productivity', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'data sharing', 'design', 'member', 'model development', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2017,316000,0.02213368992568985
"Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our previous studies provide support that such deviations indicate clinically important events at false alert rates belo 50%, which is very promising. We propose to further improve the new methodology, and build a real-time monitoring and alerting system integrated with production electronic medical records. We propose an evaluation of the system using physicians' assessment of alerts raised by our real-time system for intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in the intensive care unit (ICU). This project develops and evaluates a new clinical monitoring and alerting framework that uses electronic medical records and machine-learning methods to send alerts concerning clinical decisions in the ICU that are unexpected given the clinical context and may represent medical errors.",Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams,9278178,R01GM088224,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Production', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stream', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data archive', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'liver transplantation', 'multidisciplinary', 'prototype', 'public health relevance']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,543819,0.03740387613661935
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Tailored Drug Titration through Artificial Intelligence Optima Integrated Health Inc. (Optima) proposes to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the decision support technology for medication treatment optimization it validated in a pilot clinical trial, optima4BP. optima4BP is designed as a physician decision/action support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment independent of in-office visits, for patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN). optima4BP is designed to reduce preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of stroke, heart failure (HF) or myocardial infarction (MI) events resulting from high blood pressure (BP) above goal. Uncontrolled HTN affects 34 million Americans. The cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs, with >135 million Emergency Dptm. (ED) visits. optima4BP will improve the quality of life for uncontrolled HTN patients, and reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that emphasizes preventative care through personalized health surveillance, assessment, and action via timely and safely optimized medication treatment. Our specific aims include: Aim (1) demonstrating the efficacy of optima4BP in a randomized clinical trial (n=300 patients) deployed at UC San Francisco Medical Center. Patients will be randomized to an enhanced care (EC) arm or an optima4BP arm (O4BP). All patients will use Omron10 BP arm cuff to remotely measure their BP. For the patients in the EC arm, physicians will be provided with a monthly summary of the Omron10 data. For patients in the O4BP arm, aside from the BP monthly summary, physicians will receive (a) a risk stratified patient roster, (b) next step actions in medication optimization for each patient, and (c) access to optima4BP's secure web-service medication treatment modeling to investigate how changing current patient data could affect medication choice (e.g., change in medication choice if BP goal is lowered). We will then examine the BP value reduction between arms (success:>7 mmHg decreased systolic; >4 mmHg decreased diastolic of O4BP vs. EC), along with secondary outcomes between O4BP and EC: medication treatment action frequency; ED admissions due to HTN-related symptoms and associated hospitalizations for stroke, HF or MI; and overall cost of HTN management. Aim (2) optima4BP data processing steps will be optimized to scale-up its capability to >1000/day patient cases processing power. 3 specific optimization processing tools will be developed: Optima Extract, Transform, and Load (OETL); Optima Survey Generator (OSG), and Optima Message Builder (OMB). OETL will provide streamlined scheduling logic to extracting data from Epic® EMR (electronic medical record), optimize data mapping scripts within optima4BP, and optimize data uploading protocols. OSG will optimize the current generation protocol for patient surveys, patient response, and assignment of patient responses to specific processing modules. OMB will ensure streamlined scheduling of risk stratification updates and scheduled delivery to physician In-Basket messaging system within Epic® EHR. Our goal is to simplify the management of high blood pressure (BP) while improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel surveillance- assessment-medication treatment action artificial intelligence (optima4BP) as a physician decision support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment independent of in-office visits, with the goal of reducing preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of stroke, heart failure or heart attack events.",Tailored Drug Titration through Artificial Intelligence,9341533,R44HL132622,"['Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Office Visits', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Update', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'health care service', 'health data', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'scale up', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'tool', 'web services']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2017,849047,-0.00927115554585213
"Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives Project Summary Medicine has evolved into an era where the entire hospital progressively adopts more real-time monitoring for the patients and generates ICU like clinical data. The rapidly growing data makes ICU a snapshot for tomorrow’s standard of care that should benefit from computer-aided decision making. These data contain not only numerical or coded information, but also a large volume of unstructured narrative text such as physicians’ and nurses' notes, specialists' reports, and discharge summaries. Both types of data have been shown to be highly informative for tasks such as cohort selection, and work best in combination. However, to achieve this, specific bits of information must be extracted from the narrative reports and coded in formal representation. These bits include medical concepts such as symptoms, diseases, medications and procedures; characteristics such as certainty, severity, dose; assertions about these items, such as whether they pertain to the patient or a family member, etc.; relations among these mentions, including indications of what condition is treated by what action and its degree of success, the time sequence and duration of events, and interpretations of laboratory test results as relations among medical concepts such as cells and antigens (e.g., “[large atypical cells] express [CD30]”). Concepts and assertions can be regarded as simple relations, and our proposal focuses on modeling narrative relations to augment structured data for predicting patient outcomes. Most existing techniques for interpreting clinical narratives either rely on hand-crafted rule systems and large medical thesauri or are based on machine learning models that create classification or regression models from large annotated data sets. The former are difficult and laborious to generalize, whereas the latter require large volumes of human-labeled data and may result in models whose operation is difficult to interpret and is therefore considered unsuitable for computer-aided decision making. We propose to build on our previous work to use unsupervised learning methods that identify frequent patterns in un-annotated narratives and identify informative patterns by tensor factorization. Although existing methods can also identify patterns that are meaningful in a data-driven sense, these patterns are difficult for clinicians to understand. Our specific goal is to develop a novel method that uses a Bayesian generative model that integrates relation mining with tensor factorization to learn patterns that correspond to an understanding of the clinical domain and can be used for evidence based patient outcome prediction. Our framework represents relations in clinical narratives as graphs, then mines subgraphs for important relations. These relations are used as features in building up a tensor model in order to reduce dimensionality, discover coherent groups of relations, and explore the group interactions. We develop Bayesian formulation to integrate relation mining and tensor modeling in a generative model, to incorporate existing medical knowledge as probability priors, as well as to reliably estimate the posterior probabilities and confidence intervals of any findings from the model. Rapid growth in the hospital adoption of large volume of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has led to an unprecedented availability of narrative dataset for clinical and translational research. We propose the development of a novel Bayesian generative framework to enable extraction of accurate and clinically meaningful patterns of EHR narratives in order to support evidence based diagnostic reasoning and outcome risk prediction.",Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives,9374626,R21LM012618,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Appearance', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Assisted', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injectable', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Research Council', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TNFRSF8 gene', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'diagnostic panel', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'rapid growth', 'standard of care', 'success']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,208272,-0.013812234222934882
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team.

"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-15-005). Utilizing a hybrid approach of expert manual review and machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing, we will develop methods to rapidly analyze patient safety event data to determine which events are health IT related. We will then further categorize the health IT related safety events to determine which events could have been prevented by effective usability or implementation processes. Through this analysis we will be able to specify the usability and implementation processes that are critical to the safe and effective use of health IT. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health IT, and computer science. The proposed research is based on unique insights that our team gleaned from previous research that we conducted focusing on health IT vendor design and implementation processes. The application addresses fundamental aspects of the call for applications by providing an evidence base to improve health IT usability and safety to better inform policy and practice. This research effort is being conducted in partnership with a health IT vendor and a patient safety organization to ensure that our results align with vendor needs and to ensure the results are generalizable.

"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,9370683,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2017,1276741,-0.0071610204278607995
"Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS Project Summary Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions to date. They are, however, pharmaceutical products that carry risks. Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine- preventable illnesses. The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains up to 30,000 reports per year over the past 25 years. VAERS reports include both structured data (e.g., vaccination date, first onset date, age, and gender) and unstructured narratives that often provide detailed clinical information about the clinical events and the temporal relationship of the series of event occurrences post vaccination. The structured data only provide one onsite date whereas temporal information of the sequence of events post vaccination is contained in the unstructured narratives. Current status –While structured data in the VAERS are widely used, the narratives are generally ignored because of the challenges inherent in working with unstructured data. Without these narratives, potentially valuable information is lost. Goals - In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Specifically, built upon the state-of-art ontology and natural language processing technologies, we will develop and validate a Temporal Information Modeling, Extraction and Reasoning system for Vaccine data (TIMER-V), which will automatically extract post-vaccination events and their temporal relationships from VAERS reports, semantically infer temporal relations, and integrate the exacted unstructured data with the structured data. Furthermore, we will provide and maintain a publicly available data access interface to query the new integrated data repository, which will facilitate vaccine safety research, casual inference, and other temporal related discovery. We will also develop and validate models to predict severe AEs using the co-occurrence or temporal patterns of the series of AEs post vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make use of the unstructured narratives in the VAERS reports to facilitate the temporal related discovery to a broad community of investigators in pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, vaccine safety research, among others. Project Narrative Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine-preventable illnesses. In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. Currently the FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) only includes one onsite date in its database. The textual narratives in the reports are generally ignored primarily due to their unstructured nature. These narratives, however, contain more detailed information about the series of events that happened after vaccination, which could be valuable for more informed clinical studies. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs.

"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9284760,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'hospital readmission', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,516245,-0.015646714548010938
"How Does Automated Record Linkage Affect Inferences about Population Health? ABSTRACT  Our broad research objective is to create the Longitudinal Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-dataset (LIFE-M) spanning the late 19th and 20th century United States. Using automated record linkage technology, the LIFE-M project combines millions of vital records to reconstruct how and why individuals' health has changed across time. This multi-generational, longitudinal micro-database aims to transform research on health and longevity, on childbearing and family structure, and on the long-run health effects of early-life circumstances and exposures.  In creating LIFE-M, however, we have encountered serious deficits in knowledge about the performance of automated record linkage technology. The proposed project seeks to evaluate the performance of the most popular and cutting-edge automated linking techniques for the purposes of creating longitudinal health data. Our specific aims are to (1) produce systematic evidence regarding the performance of automated record linking algorithms in terms of match rates, representativeness of the linked sample, erroneous matches (type I errors), and systematic measurement error; (2) examine how phonetic name-cleaning methods affect quality metrics; and (3) examine how record quality metrics vary for different underrepresented subgroups (including women, racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrants) and to determine how linking methods affect representativeness and inferences. To achieve these aims, we have developed new partnerships with record linking experts allowing us to incorporate the most cutting-edge methods in record linking. We will also rely on new “ground truth” generated by LIFE-M project's independent, double-blind human review process.  This project will contribute significantly to existing knowledge about the use of automated linking methods for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health data. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in health studies. Both contributions should greatly enhance the quality of descriptive and causal inferences about population health and aging and disparities in these outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by advancing record linking methodology for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health datasets. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in public health and aging studies using linked records.

"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care. Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient. The main idea underlying the approach is that patterns of past EMR usage patterns can be exploited to selectively highlight clinically useful patient data.",Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System,9297355,R01LM012095,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemoglobin', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Provider', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer human interaction', 'data access', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'stem', 'trend', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,444581,0.008408080985097172
"NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Errors in medical documents represent a critical issue that can adversely affect healthcare quality and safety. Physician use of speech recognition (SR) technology has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency at the point of care. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed in SR-generated medical documents. Error correction and content editing can be time consuming for clinicians. A solution to this problem is to improve accuracy through automated error detection using natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) build a large corpus of clinical documents dictated via SR across different healthcare institutions and clinical settings; 2) conduct error analysis to estimate the prevalence and severity of SR errors; 3) develop innovative methods based on NLP for automated error detection and correction and create a comprehensive knowledge base that contains confusion sets, error frequencies and other error patterns; 4) evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and tool; and 5) distribute our methods and findings to make them available to other researchers.  We believe this application aligns with AHRQ's HIT and Patient Safety portfolios as well as AHRQ's Special Emphasis Notice to support projects to generate new evidence on health IT system safety (NOT- HS-15-005).

"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9319536,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2017,449993,0.007177096688978056
"Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems V (CAHPS V) Consumers, providers and health care purchasers need high-quality information to help them compare and evaluate their health care options. The CAHPS V project will advance the AHRQ CAHPS mission of improving patients' experiences with health care by developing and evaluating strategies for survey measurement, reporting and quality improvement (QI). We propose a 5-year effort to advance the science and practice of patient experience assessment, continue innovation to ensure relevance to health service delivery and implement best survey practices, further the science of reporting, and evaluate CAHPS QI efforts. We will develop program communication strategies, and disseminate and promote use of CAHPS products. In particular, we will develop a survey to assess patient experiences with end-of-life care; develop new items to assess shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety; test alternatives to the standard CAHPS modes of data collection), explore the feasibility of administering a short-form survey dividing CG-CAHPS composites among respondents to reduce response burden, elicit stakeholder feedback about the value of different CAHPS supplement item sets, evaluate “The Your CAHPS Survey” that was designed to help users of the CAHPS surveys compile a survey tailed to their specific needs, and evaluate existing Spanish translations of CAHPS surveys. In addition, we will gather input from stakeholders on best practices for narrative data analysis, develop an approach for using automated Natural Language Processing for analyses of narratives, and construct an algorithm approach to select representative narratives that reflect and illustrate overall provider ratings. Finally, we will evaluate the contribution of patient narratives to quality improvement efforts in hospital care for children, characterize primary care practices use of the CG-CAHPS survey and patient-centered medical home items during PCMH transformation, assess the impact of pay- for-performance for care delivered by primary and specialty care safety net providers on CAHPS survey responses, explore the value of new shared decision-making, patient engagement, communication and patient safety items for QI and identify QI strategies that improve patient experience across various settings. We will also advance analytic methods for CAHPS data. The project team is well suited to achieving the study objectives given its prior accomplishments and established working relationships.

"Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Timely reporting and effective learning from medical incidents is considered an effective way in developing strategies for reducing medical errors. Utilizing an innovative a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach combining with case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques, we propose to develop a knowledgebase and learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, linking historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews on patient safety. We envision that the innovative approach will facilitate timely, quality reporting and learning from the incidents and ultimately cultivating a just and learning culture of patient safety.",Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit,9352770,R01HS022895,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,249135,0.04106074004810893
"Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A complete patient problem list is the cornerstone of the problem-oriented medical record. It serves as a valuable tool for providers assessing a patient's clinical status and succinctly communicates this information between providers. Accurate problem lists drive clinical decision support tools that improve quality, and an accurate problem list has been associated with higher quality care. Accurate problem lists are also critical for establishing accurate phenotypes for research and supporting quality improvement; however, problem lists in electronic health records are routinely incomplete. In this study, we propose to develop and validate problem inference algorithms to identify problems potentially missing from patient problem lists, and to conduct a randomized trial of these algorithms, studying their effects on quality of care. We call our approach IQ-MAPLE. Our project has three specific aims: 1) develop problem inference algorithms for heart, lung, and blood conditions, 2) implement problem inference alerts and optimize the workflow at four sites and 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial of the problem inference alerts, measuring the acceptance rate of alerts, the direct effect on problem list completeness and, critically, downstream impact of the alerts on key clinical quality measures, including both process and outcomes across a range of heart, lung and blood conditions. If successful, IQ-MAPLE will improve problem list accuracy, which has significant downstream implications: More accurate clinical decision support: Most clinical decision support is disease-oriented and, as such, depends on an accurate problem list. When problems are missing, opportunities to provide support to the clinician are missed, and quality suffers. Better quality measurement: Quality measurement today is often inaccurate, as patients are omitted from measures due to incomplete information on their clinical problems. A more accurate problem list would, in turn, lead to more accurate quality measurement. More accurate research: Clinical, translational and even basic science and genomic research increasingly use EHR data, particularly to identify patients with disease phenotypes, generally using problem lists. When problems are missing, the accuracy of research suffers. Better patient care: Secondary benefits aside, the problem list is, fundamentally, a tool for organizing patient care and communicating among providers. A more accurate, problem list supports these goals. The IQ-MAPLE rules, and our best practices for implementing them, will be freely available, ensuring broad dissemination of these benefits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An accurate, complete clinical problem list the cornerstone of a problem-oriented medical record, and research shows that accurate problem lists improve healthcare quality; however, problem lists are often incomplete. In this study, we will develop and evaluate an intervention to identify gaps in problem lists for patients with heart, lung, and blood conditions.

"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with cancer experience significant side effects from their treatments, but these side effects are under- reported on clinical trials and no work has been done to improve the current system of side effect reporting. This study will create a new system of identifying and reporting side effects that is more accurate and efficient than the current system. The results of this research will provide clinicians, patients and their families with a true understanding of potential side effects of therapies used to treat childhood cancer.",Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials,9452250,K07CA211956,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Acute leukemia', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Child', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nephrotoxic', 'Oncology Group', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K07,2017,169044,0.01888213648874968
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.            ",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9105846,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2016,413500,-0.026297643455314327
"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).         ",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9076888,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,240650,-0.009319495002499468
"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is the predominant method for screening for colorectal cancer in the US. Yet, its effectiveness in screening is limited by variation in performance. For example, the rate at which physicians detect cancer precursors called adenomas during a colonoscopy has been shown to vary three-fold from one physician to another. A patient whose colonoscopy is performed by a physician with a low adenoma detection rate has a higher risk of subsequent colorectal cancer.  Our proposal centers on measuring, understanding, and improving colonoscopy quality. The major innovation of this work is to use natural language processing (NLP) to measure the quality of colonoscopy. NLP is a field of computer science in which a computer is trained to ""read"" text to identify relevant data We developed and validated the first NLP-based computer software application (C-QUAL) that analyzes colonoscopy and associated pathology reports. Our primary quality measure is adenoma detection rate because it is a common, validated measure that is linked to colorectal cancer incidence. However, we also use a number of secondary quality measures. We applied C-QUAL to almost 25,000 colonoscopy reports in one health system and found large variation in physician's performance on the quality measures. Building on this prior work, our goal is to use C-QUAL to measure colonoscopy quality across a spectrum of US practice environments, to understand what drives variation in colonoscopy quality, and to improve colonoscopy quality. In Aim 1, we propose to use the C-QUAL tool to measure performance in 4 diverse health care systems. This will be one of the largest assessments of the variation in adenoma detection rates and will span different geographic regions, payment systems, and practice settings. In Aim 2, we seek to understand why there is variation in quality. We will survey providers at the 4 health care systems about factors that might affect quality. We will link those survey results to the adenoma detection rates assessed in Aim 1 and look for key associations. It is assumed, but not proven, that providing feedback to physicians on colonoscopy quality will improve care. In Aim 3, we assess whether feedback to physicians does drive quality improvement and, building on Aim 2, explore which types of physicians may respond to feedback. Our proposal is the first to use this innovative method to measure colonoscopy quality and to use the quality scores to decrease the variation in colonoscopy performance. Together the results of the 3 aims are consistent with the NCI's focus on improving the quality of colorectal cancer screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and provide physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.",Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing,9025565,R01CA168959,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'payment', 'programs', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2016,409330,-0.005164278781927201
"Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Supervised machine learning is a popular method that uses labeled training examples to predict future outcomes.  Unfortunately, supervised machine learning for biomedical research is often limited by a lack of labeled data.  Current methods to produce labeled data involve manual chart reviews that are laborious and do not scale with data creation rates.  This project aims to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records by forming a crowd of clinical personnel labelers.  The construction of these labeled data sets will allow for new biomedical research studies that were previously infeasible to conduct.  There are numerous practical and theoretical challenges of developing a crowd sourcing platform for clinical data.  First, popular, public crowd sourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk are not suitable for medical record labeling as HIPAA makes clinical data sharing risky.  Second, the types of clinical questions that are amenable for crowd sourcing are not well understood.  Third, it is unclear if the clinical crowd can produce labels quickly and accurately.  Each of these challenges will be addressed in a separate Aim. As the first Aim of this project, the team will evaluate different clinical crowd sourcing architectures.  The architecture must leverage the scale of the crowd, while minimizing patient information exposure.  De-identification tools will be considered to scrub clinical notes t reduce information leakage.  Using this design, the team will extend a popular open source crowd sourcing tool, Pybossa, and release it to the public.  As the second Aim, the team will study the type, structure, topic and specificity of clinical prediction questions, and how these characteristics impact labeler quality.  Lastly, the team will evaluate the quality and accuracy of collected clinical crowd sourced data on two existing chart review problems to determine the platform's utility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traditionally, clinical prediction models rely on supervised machine learning algorithms to probabilistically predict clinical events using labeled medical records.  When data sets are small, manual chart reviews performed by clinical staff are sufficient to label each outcome; however, as data sets have scaled up and researchers aim to study larger cohorts, current manual approaches become intractable.

"Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our previous studies provide support that such deviations indicate clinically important events at false alert rates belo 50%, which is very promising. We propose to further improve the new methodology, and build a real-time monitoring and alerting system integrated with production electronic medical records. We propose an evaluation of the system using physicians' assessment of alerts raised by our real-time system for intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in the intensive care unit (ICU). This project develops and evaluates a new clinical monitoring and alerting framework that uses electronic medical records and machine-learning methods to send alerts concerning clinical decisions in the ICU that are unexpected given the clinical context and may represent medical errors.",Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams,9095389,R01GM088224,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Production', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stream', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'data archive', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'liver transplantation', 'multidisciplinary', 'prototype']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,548500,0.03740387613661935
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An unsolved problem in health informatics is how to apply the past experiences of patients, stored in large-scale medical records systems, to predict the outcomes of patients and to individualize care. One approach to prediction, heretofore impractical, is rapidly finding a patient cohort ""similar enough"" to an index case that the health experiences and outcomes of this cohort are informative for prediction. This task is formidable because of large variability of the vast numbers of patient attributes with the added complexity of sequences of patient encounters evolving over time. Epidemiological considerations such as confounding by indication for treatment also come into play. The objective of this research effort is to (1) create a modular test bed that uses a ""big data"" systems architecture to support research in rapid individualized prediction of outcomes from large clinical repositories and (2) to explore various approaches to making ""pragmatic"" near-term predictions of outcomes. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database (VINCI), a research database with records of tens of millions of patients, we will explore two synergistic strategies for rapidly finding a cohort of patients that are similar enough to an index patient to predict near-term treatment response and/or adverse effects in an elastic cloud environment: 1) use of temporal alignment of critical events including use of gene sequence alignment methods to relax requirements for exact temporal matching; and, 2) use of conceptual distance metrics to model the degree of content similarity of case records. The initial domain of application will be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The approach will apply open source ""big data"" methodologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo, to store and filter ""medical log"" files. The content of these ""logs"" will be processed by a combination with strategies including conceptual markup of events using natural language processing tools, matching of event streams, and statistical data mining methods to rapidly retrieve and identify patients that are sufficiently similar to an index case to be able to make personalized yet pragmatic clinical predictions of outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This proposal studies how to use experience of past patients, stored in electronic medical records systems, to help clinicians make practical decisions on the care of complex patients with type 1 diabetes. Research applies methods adapted from Internet search engines and from studies of the human genome to determine what it means for one patient's disease experiences to be similar to and relevant to another's. n/a",BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO),9066173,R01GM108346,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Visualization software', 'Vocabulary', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer type', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'learning strategy', 'medical information system', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'parallel processing', 'performance tests', 'personalized care', 'predict clinical outcome', 'processing speed', 'reference genome', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'search engine', 'sugar', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2016,507805,0.013492119250074356
"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-15-005). Utilizing a hybrid approach of expert manual review and machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing, we will develop methods to rapidly analyze patient safety event data to determine which events are health IT related. We will then further categorize the health IT related safety events to determine which events could have been prevented by effective usability or implementation processes.

"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary As United States healthcare seeks to address inconsistent quality and overwhelming cost, data and technology have become central to all suggested approaches. With newly available electronic health data and massive growth in processing power, the hardest challenges in using clinical data are becoming clear. Big data holds the potential to enable personalized patient care, population health management, and value-based payment models. However, it also creates challenges in discriminating accurate data from inaccurate or incomplete information. One of the greatest areas of data inaccuracy is the patient phenotype, or clinical description of the patient. Every clinical decision support tool, population health management system, and payment reform product relies on accurate electronic patient descriptions as its source data. But, the descriptions are not accurate, most notably in terms of completeness and granularity. Recall often falls below 50% in describing a patient’s medical conditions, such as heart failure and cancer. Detailed descriptions such as low ejection fraction heart failure or stage III breast cancer, needed for downstream analytics, are lacking in the discrete record. Poor data puts care delivery, payment reform, and population health efforts in peril. The time is right for technology to proactively define the clinical phenotype from source data, without reliance on current manual approaches. This will necessitate overcoming challenges in harmonizing discrepant narrative and discrete data, inferring when a characteristic such as cough is a primary condition versus symptom of another condition, and screening noise from signal in robust narrative text. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will include the following specific aims: 1. Create the components required to define an accurate and comprehensive clinical phenotype,  including: (i) extract problem, medication, procedure, and lab features from clinical data using  natural language processing (NLP) and ontologic mapping, (ii) build a large knowledge database  of associated clinical conditions, and (iii) assess extracted features against the knowledge  database to accurately distinguish symptoms from diseases and surface relevant active diseases  in a candidate problem list. 2. Validate the clinical phenotyping components using de-identified longitudinal clinical data for  10,000 patients The goal, dependent on Phase I success, is to create an automated, accurate, and robust clinical phenotyping engine to enable personalized patient care, population health management, and value- based payment models. Project Narrative Individual and global care improvement demands accurate phenotypes. This type of clinical phenotyping is extremely challenging, requiring full clinical data and advanced semantic technologies to develop a longitudinal patient map. The approach, if successful, offers an opportunity to empower national efforts to improve outcomes and reduce costs.",Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare,9199039,R43LM012357,"['Address', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Congresses', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Electronics', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'discrete data', 'empowered', 'experience', 'falls', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'payment', 'personalized care', 'population health', 'screening', 'success', 'support tools']",NLM,"VMT, INC.",R43,2016,222977,-0.007700828801388086
"Semi-supervised learning with electronic medical records Project Summary/Abstract The implementation of electronic medical record (EMR) systems in routine healthcare has resulted in a rich and inexpensive source of data for translational research. When linked with specimen biobanks, these extensive databases offer a unique opportunity to accelerate the goals of disease genomics as they contain large amounts of detailed clinical and genetic data collected for the purposes of medical care [4; 6; 7; 8; 9]. However, the statistical methods to analyze EMR data are limited and thus the focus of this proposal.  In particular, extracting accurate disease phenotype information is a major challenge impeding EMR-based research [10]. Currently, ICD9 codes are used to conﬁrm presence or absence of a disease in cohorts derived from EMRs. These codes are extremely variable and therefore have a signiﬁcant impact on the statistical power of genetic studies [11; 12]. An alternative approach is to develop a highly accurate algorithm to classify disease status. But due to the laborious medical record review required to obtain validated phenotype information for classiﬁer estimation, phenotypes are only available for a small training set nested in a large cohort. In contrast, predictors of phenotype are available for all observations. To improve accuracy and efﬁciency in model estimation and evaluation, it is therefore of interest to develop semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods that utilize the so- called unlabeled data or observations without conﬁrmed phenotype status in addition to the labeled training set.  Although a great body of literature on SSL exists, nearly all methods concern estimation of classiﬁers or prediction rules when the labeled training set is a simple random sample from the large unlabeled data set [13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20; 21]. Despite the practical importance of evaluating the prediction performance of an estimated model, no SSL procedures currently exist to improve the estimation of model performance parame- ters. Additionally, the simple random sampling assumption is restrictive and the development of semi-supervised (SS) methods that accommodate more ﬂexible sampling schemes in the context of both model estimation and evaluation is needed.  In this proposal, these limitations are addressed through formulation of an efﬁcient method to estimate various prediction performance measures including the ROC curve within the traditional SS framework of simple random sampling. The stratiﬁed random sampling design in the SS setting is also considered and methods to estimate a classiﬁer and its accuracy are developed. These procedures will be applied to EMR-based studies of bipolar disorder and depression. The success of this work will thus improve efﬁciency in analyzing EMR data and expedite the use of EMRs in clinical and genetic research in neuropsychiatry. Project Narrative  The use of electronic medical records (EMRs) in routine healthcare has generated a rich source of data for in-depth study of disease risk factors. However, EMR data typically consists of a very small number of expensive observations with information on disease status and a large amount of automatically extracted data concerning risk factors such as laboratory results and previous health history. Statistical methods that accommodate this data structure are limited and thus the focus of this proposal.",Semi-supervised learning with electronic medical records,9192096,F31GM119263,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'ROC Curve', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data structure', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'repository', 'success']",NIGMS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2016,34098,0.003781435044037755
"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care. Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient.

"NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Errors in medical documents represent a critical issue that can adversely affect healthcare quality and safety. Physician use of speech recognition (SR) technology has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency at the point of care. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed in SR-generated medical documents. Error correction and content editing can be time consuming for clinicians. A solution to this problem is to improve accuracy through automated error detection using natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) build a large corpus of clinical documents dictated via SR across different healthcare institutions and clinical settings; 2) conduct error analysis to estimate the prevalence and severity of SR errors; 3) develop innovative methods based on NLP for automated error detection and correction and create a comprehensive knowledge base that contains confusion sets, error frequencies and other error patterns; 4) evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and tool; and 5) distribute our methods and findings to make them available to other researchers.

"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality.

"Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Timely reporting and effective learning from medical incidents is considered an effective way in developing strategies for reducing medical errors. Utilizing an innovative a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach combining with case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques, we propose to develop a knowledgebase and learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, linking historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews on patient safety. We envision that the innovative approach will facilitate timely, quality reporting and learning from the incidents and ultimately cultivating a just and learning culture of patient safety.",Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit,9144757,R01HS022895,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2016,249135,0.04106074004810893
"Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A complete patient problem list is the cornerstone of the problem-oriented medical record. It serves as a valuable tool for providers assessing a patient's clinical status and succinctly communicates this information between providers. Accurate problem lists drive clinical decision support tools that improve quality, and an accurate problem list has been associated with higher quality care. Accurate problem lists are also critical for establishing accurate phenotypes for research and supporting quality improvement; however, problem lists in electronic health records are routinely incomplete. In this study, we propose to develop and validate problem inference algorithms to identify problems potentially missing from patient problem lists, and to conduct a randomized trial of these algorithms, studying their effects on quality of care. We call our approach IQ-MAPLE. Our project has three specific aims: 1) develop problem inference algorithms for heart, lung, and blood conditions, 2) implement problem inference alerts and optimize the workflow at four sites and 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial of the problem inference alerts, measuring the acceptance rate of alerts, the direct effect on problem list completeness and, critically, downstream impact of the alerts on key clinical quality measures, including both process and outcomes across a range of heart, lung and blood conditions. If successful, IQ-MAPLE will improve problem list accuracy, which has significant downstream implications: More accurate clinical decision support: Most clinical decision support is disease-oriented and, as such, depends on an accurate problem list. When problems are missing, opportunities to provide support to the clinician are missed, and quality suffers. Better quality measurement: Quality measurement today is often inaccurate, as patients are omitted from measures due to incomplete information on their clinical problems. A more accurate problem list would, in turn, lead to more accurate quality measurement. More accurate research: Clinical, translational and even basic science and genomic research increasingly use EHR data, particularly to identify patients with disease phenotypes, generally using problem lists. When problems are missing, the accuracy of research suffers. Better patient care: Secondary benefits aside, the problem list is, fundamentally, a tool for organizing patient care and communicating among providers. A more accurate, problem list supports these goals. The IQ-MAPLE rules, and our best practices for implementing them, will be freely available, ensuring broad dissemination of these benefits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An accurate, complete clinical problem list the cornerstone of a problem-oriented medical record, and research shows that accurate problem lists improve healthcare quality; however, problem lists are often incomplete. In this study, we will develop and evaluate an intervention to identify gaps in problem lists for patients with heart, lung, and blood conditions. If successful, this system should improve problem list completeness and, ultimately, the quality of care delivered to patients.",Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE),9040788,R01HL122225,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Aneurysm', 'Basic Science', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New England', 'Nurses', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem-Oriented Medical Records', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Site', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'knowledge base', 'neglect', 'patient safety', 'randomized trial', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,458227,0.0004411086129647086
"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is the predominant method for screening for colorectal cancer in the US. Yet, its effectiveness in screening is limited by variation in performance. For example, the rate at which physicians detect cancer precursors called adenomas during a colonoscopy has been shown to vary three-fold from one physician to another. A patient whose colonoscopy is performed by a physician with a low adenoma detection rate has a higher risk of subsequent colorectal cancer.  Our proposal centers on measuring, understanding, and improving colonoscopy quality. The major innovation of this work is to use natural language processing (NLP) to measure the quality of colonoscopy. NLP is a field of computer science in which a computer is trained to ""read"" text to identify relevant data We developed and validated the first NLP-based computer software application (C-QUAL) that analyzes colonoscopy and associated pathology reports. Our primary quality measure is adenoma detection rate because it is a common, validated measure that is linked to colorectal cancer incidence. However, we also use a number of secondary quality measures. We applied C-QUAL to almost 25,000 colonoscopy reports in one health system and found large variation in physician's performance on the quality measures. Building on this prior work, our goal is to use C-QUAL to measure colonoscopy quality across a spectrum of US practice environments, to understand what drives variation in colonoscopy quality, and to improve colonoscopy quality. In Aim 1, we propose to use the C-QUAL tool to measure performance in 4 diverse health care systems. This will be one of the largest assessments of the variation in adenoma detection rates and will span different geographic regions, payment systems, and practice settings. In Aim 2, we seek to understand why there is variation in quality. We will survey providers at the 4 health care systems about factors that might affect quality. We will link those survey results to the adenoma detection rates assessed in Aim 1 and look for key associations. It is assumed, but not proven, that providing feedback to physicians on colonoscopy quality will improve care. In Aim 3, we assess whether feedback to physicians does drive quality improvement and, building on Aim 2, explore which types of physicians may respond to feedback. Our proposal is the first to use this innovative method to measure colonoscopy quality and to use the quality scores to decrease the variation in colonoscopy performance. Together the results of the 3 aims are consistent with the NCI's focus on improving the quality of colorectal cancer screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and provide physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.",Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing,8830936,R01CA168959,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'payment', 'programs', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2015,494533,-0.005164278781927201
"Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our previous studies provide support that such deviations indicate clinically important events at false alert rates belo 50%, which is very promising. We propose to further improve the new methodology, and build a real-time monitoring and alerting system integrated with production electronic medical records. We propose an evaluation of the system using physicians' assessment of alerts raised by our real-time system for intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in the intensive care unit (ICU). This project develops and evaluates a new clinical monitoring and alerting framework that uses electronic medical records and machine-learning methods to send alerts concerning clinical decisions in the ICU that are unexpected given the clinical context and may represent medical errors.",Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams,8912480,R01GM088224,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Production', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Stream', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'design', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'liver transplantation', 'multidisciplinary', 'prototype']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,583203,0.03740387613661935
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An unsolved problem in health informatics is how to apply the past experiences of patients, stored in large-scale medical records systems, to predict the outcomes of patients and to individualize care. One approach to prediction, heretofore impractical, is rapidly finding a patient cohort ""similar enough"" to an index case that the health experiences and outcomes of this cohort are informative for prediction. This task is formidable because of large variability of the vast numbers of patient attributes with the added complexity of sequences of patient encounters evolving over time. Epidemiological considerations such as confounding by indication for treatment also come into play. The objective of this research effort is to (1) create a modular test bed that uses a ""big data"" systems architecture to support research in rapid individualized prediction of outcomes from large clinical repositories and (2) to explore various approaches to making ""pragmatic"" near-term predictions of outcomes. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database (VINCI), a research database with records of tens of millions of patients, we will explore two synergistic strategies for rapidly finding a cohort of patients that are similar enough to an index patient to predict near-term treatment response and/or adverse effects in an elastic cloud environment: 1) use of temporal alignment of critical events including use of gene sequence alignment methods to relax requirements for exact temporal matching; and, 2) use of conceptual distance metrics to model the degree of content similarity of case records. The initial domain of application will be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The approach will apply open source ""big data"" methodologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo, to store and filter ""medical log"" files. The content of these ""logs"" will be processed by a combination with strategies including conceptual markup of events using natural language processing tools, matching of event streams, and statistical data mining methods to rapidly retrieve and identify patients that are sufficiently similar to an index case to be able to make personalized yet pragmatic clinical predictions of outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This proposal studies how to use experience of past patients, stored in electronic medical records systems, to help clinicians make practical decisions on the care of complex patients with type 1 diabetes. Research applies methods adapted from Internet search engines and from studies of the human genome to determine what it means for one patient's disease experiences to be similar to and relevant to another's.              n/a",BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO),8840825,R01GM108346,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Visualization software', 'Vocabulary', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer type', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'medical information system', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'performance tests', 'processing speed', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sugar', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NIGMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2015,529458,0.013492119250074356
"BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): IBM estimates that 30% of the entire data in the world is medical information. Medical images occupy a significant portion of medical records with approximately 100 million scans in US and growing every year. In addition, the data size from each scan steadfastly increases as the image resolution improves. These BigData are not structured and due to lack of standardized imaging protocols, they are highly heterogeneous with different spatial resolutions, contrasts, slice orientations, etc. In this project, we will deelop a technology to structure and search medical imaging information, which will make the past data available for education and evidence-based clinical decision-making. In this grant, we will focus on brain MRI, which comprises the largest portion of MRI data. The target community will be physicians who make decisions and the patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries. Currently, radiological image data are stored in clinical database called PACS. The image data in PACS are not structured. Consequently, once the diagnosis of a patient is completed, most of the data in PACS are currently discarded in the archive. Radiologists rely on their experience and education to reach medical decisions. This is a typical problem in medical practice that calls for objective evidence-based medicine. There are many ongoing attempts to structure the text fields of PACS, which include natural language processing of free-text radiological reports, clinical information, and diagnosis. In our approach, we propose to structure the image data, not text fields, to support direct search of images. Namely, physicians will submit an image of a new patient and search past images with similar anatomical phenotypes. Then, the clinical reports of the retrieved data will be compiled for a statistical report of the diagnosis and prognosis. We believe this image structuration is the key to ""unlock the vast amounts of information currently stored"" in PACS and use them for education and modern evidence-based medical decisions. The specific aims are; Objective 1: To develop and test the accuracy of high-throughput image structuration technologies Objective 2: To develop and test the image search engine Objective 3: Capacity Building Requirement: To develop prototype cloud system for data structuration / search services for research and educational purposes n/a",BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data,8852613,R01EB017638,"['Archives', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'beneficiary', 'clinical decision-making', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'outcome forecast', 'prototype', 'radiologist']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,213115,0.009267329501830965

"Worcester Heart Attack Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This population-based study proposes to continue the examination of changing long-term trends in the descriptive epidemiology of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and out-of hospital deaths due to coronary heart disease (CHD) in residents of the Worcester, MA, metropolitan area. The specific objectives of this population- based study are to examine contemporary (2013 and 2015), as compared with prior (1975-2011), trends in the annual incidence and attack rates of AMI, hospital and post-discharge survival rates, management practices, and out-of-hospital deaths attributed to CHD. To accomplish these and several additional secondary study objectives, this investigation will be carried out in the 11 acute care general hospitals providing care for residents of central Massachusetts. All new (incident) and recurrent episodes of definite AMI occurring in greater Worcester residents during 2013 and 2015 will be identified from discharge diagnostic printouts obtained from all metropolitan Worcester hospitals of patients with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of AMI and related CHD rubrics. The medical records of these patients will be individually reviewed for validation purposes according to pre-established criteria for AMI. Abstraction of the medical records of patients satisfying the study diagnostic and geographic eligibility criteria will be carried out by trained physicians with the recording of demographic, clinical, treatment, and outcomes related data. A review of records for additional hospitalizations and a search of death certificates will be carried out to examine the long-term survival status of discharged hospital patients from each of the proposed 2 study years, as well as those identified previously, through 2017. Death certificates will be reviewed to identify cases of out-of-hospital deaths attributed to CHD occurring during 2013 and 2015. In addition, we will assess the feasibility of carrying out an innovative approach for ""real time"" surveillance of acute coronary disease in this central MA population through the development of natural language processing systems that will automatically extract clinical information from electronic medical records in our most recently hospitalized patient cohort in 2015. Monitoring contemporary trends in our principal study outcomes remains timely given the ongoing publication and dissemination of treatment guidelines and recommendations by national agencies and emphasis on improving quality in processes of care. Given the ""real world"" setting of this investigation, important contemporary insights would be provided into current gaps between ideal and achieved patient care in the broader community setting, to assist in the development of novel educational approaches and incentives to provide more optimal patient care.

"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care.             Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient.

"NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Errors in medical documents represent a critical issue that can adversely affect healthcare quality and safety. Physician use of speech recognition (SR) technology has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency at the point of care. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed in SR-generated medical documents. Error correction and content editing can be time consuming for clinicians. A solution to this problem is to improve accuracy through automated error detection using natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) build a large corpus of clinical documents dictated via SR across different healthcare institutions and clinical settings; 2) conduct error analysis to estimate the prevalence and severity of SR errors; 3) develop innovative methods based on NLP for automated error detection and correction and create a comprehensive knowledge base that contains confusion sets, error frequencies and other error patterns; 4) evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and tool; and 5) distribute our methods and findings to make them available to other researchers.

Physician use of speech recognition technology, a computerized form of medical transcription, has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed. The goal of this study is two-fold: 1) to study the nature of such errors and how they may affect the quality of care and 2) to develop innovative methods based on computerized natural language processing to automatically detect these errors in clinical documents so that physicians can correct the documents before entering them into the patient's medical record.            ",NLP to Improve Accuracy and Quality of Dictated Medical Documents,9004939,R01HS024264,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,250000,-0.003600636994662023
"Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physician progress notes contain information essential to patient care, including findings from history and physical exam, interpretation of tests, assessment and treatment plans. However in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians spend more time creating them, which has led to the use of time-saving measures such as copy/paste and templates that have degraded note accuracy and quality. This threatens the usefulness of notes not only for their most important use-patient care-but also for research, quality improvement, and in supporting reimbursement. To address these problems, we propose a project with the following specific aims: 1. To refine and implement a new voice-generated enhanced electronic note system (VGEENS) integrating voice recognition with natural language processing and links to the electronic medical record (EMR) to improve note accuracy and timeliness. 2. To evaluate VGEENS using a randomized trial with 30 internal medicine physicians in each arm to assess electronic note accuracy, quality, timeliness, and user satisfaction. Intervention physicians will use VGEENS, while the control physicians will continue with note creation as they normally would. This novel approach has the potential to improve note accuracy while reducing delays in making progress notes in EMRs available to other clinicians. It leverages rapidly improving voice recognition and NLP technologies to permit physicians to use a natural, fast method-human voice-to convey their observation and thoughts into the EMR record. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physician documentation of a patient visit contains information that is used in that patient's care. This information includes findings from a patient' history and physical exam, interpretation of necessary tests, the problem assessment and treatment plan. However, in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians are spending more time creating these notes. This has led to use of time-saving measures that have degraded the accuracy and ease of use of patient notes. By the end of this project, we expect to have developed, used and evaluated a new method for creating electronic physician notes that both improve accuracy and timely availability of inpatient progress notes.","Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach",8928601,R21HS023631,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,139245,0.016489328054229646
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,8915498,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2015,419993,0.007177096688978056
"Subgroup Analytics and Advanced Semantic Technologies to Enable Personalized Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): United States healthcare is embroiled in a crisis of inconsistent quality and overwhelming cost. Through two administrations, the national healthcare strategy has focused on using data and technology to control costs and improve care. Congress has enacted legislation to encourage measurement of quality, sharing of data, payment based on quality of care, and transparency within the healthcare system. While these goals are bipartisan and lofty, implementation requires both hard work from health systems and robust technology. Industry has developed technologies that incrementally further the national agenda, including electronic health records, computer assisted coding, and population health analytics. Each of these supports workflow within the healthcare system and improves profit margin for healthcare organizations. But, approaches that go beyond workflow, using data to better understand clinical care, are lacking. With newly available electronic health data and a massive increase in processing power, data-driven personalized medicine is just now becoming possible. It will require advanced semantic technologies to understand clinical care strategies that have been tried in the past, but that have unknown efficacy. It will pose informatics challenges in inferring inclusion criteria, interventions, and outcomes from incomplete and poorly structured data. It will require deep clinical understanding to run real-time pragmatic clinical trials based on real world data to understand complex patients. The goal, dependent on Phase I success, is to create the first commercial system to support healthcare in running real-time pragmatic clinical trials using full clinical data. This will augment the standard of care defined by randomized controlled trials to actually tailor therapy for those complex patients that account for the majority of healthcare spends, but for whom complexity precludes tailored randomized trials.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successful, the Phase I effort will represent a first step toward a revolutionary approach to leverage newly collected clinical data, rapidly evolving semantic technologies, and cutting edge clinical informatics to define best practices in healthcare. The overall project will target the complex patients that are poorly served by generalization of the randomized trial and currently account for the majority of healthcare spend. The goal is to leverage the national investment in clinical data to not just improve clinical workflow, but to actually transform medicine to achieve national goals of reducing costs and improving outcomes.            ",Subgroup Analytics and Advanced Semantic Technologies to Enable Personalized Medicine,8979535,R43LM012168,"['Accounting', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Congresses', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Semantics', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'World Health', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'health data', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'meetings', 'payment', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'standard of care', 'success']",NLM,"VMT, INC.",R43,2015,224712,-0.001969265794008538
"Outpatient Adverse Drug Effect Alerting System Using Admission H&P Notes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will create, test, implement, and evaluate a real-time Adverse Drug Effect (ADE) alerting system at Vanderbilt University Hospital (VUH). Utilizing information extracted from admission history and physical examination notes (H&Ps) stored in the electronic medical record (EMR), our system will detect adult inpatients' previously unrecognized symptomatic ADEs and alert appropriate care providers. The project will create an ADE knowledge base, mined from multiple publically available sources including MEDLINE, RxNorm, and the product labels for human prescription drugs. Next, we will apply natural language processing (NLP) to EMR-based H&P texts to identify mentions of patients' current medications and dosages. We will similarly detect EMR-based H&P documentation of patients' clinical manifestations (CMs - diseases, symptoms, findings, etc.), and then represent them using the Unified Medical Language System's (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs). The system will then compare each patient's recognized medications and CMs against the aforementioned ADE knowledgebase, generating appropriate patient-specific alerts for potential adverse effects related to the patient's current medications. Each alert will identify the offendin medication, the suspected nature of the ADE, and evidence supporting the assertion. We will independently evaluate the accuracy of the ADE knowledgebase using expert manual review and comparison to multiple other sources. Before implementing the real-time ADE monitoring system, we will conduct a pilot implementation using retrospective EMR data from the Vanderbilt Synthetic Derivative (SD), a de-identified version of the Vanderbilt EMR. After successful testing and any necessary iterative improvements, we will implement the real-time detection system at VUH, initially monitoring newly admitted inpatients presenting to the Internal Medicine service. Using the methods described above, the system will detect potential ADEs each time a new inpatient H&P is generated, and alert appropriate clinicians via additions to an existing dashboard that the clinicians already utilize. We will survey clinicians immediately upon receipt of an ADE alert to determine if the alerting condition was already known or not, whether the alert seems plausible, and whether it requires intervention. Then we will compare discharge medications to admission medications to determine what actions occurred post-alert, independent of physician survey results. We will thus evaluate both the effectiveness of the system in improving ADE recognition and its perceived usefulness according to the physician-subjects. We hypothesize that our system will improve clinicians' awareness of ADEs in a manner applicable to any facility that stores admission H&Ps electronically. Addressing previously unrecognized ADEs has the potential to reduce costs and improve patient care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unrecognized adverse drug effects (ADEs), a serious clinical problem, cause preventable hospitalizations, increase healthcare costs, and worsen health outcomes. To potentially improve quality of care, my dissertation project will develop and evaluate a novel system to detect adult inpatients' previously unrecognized symptomatic ADEs and alert appropriate care providers. Using automated natural language processing of clinician-generated electronic admission history and physical exam (H&P) notes and a locally-developed ADE knowledgebase derived from publically available sources, the system, once validated, could improve both recognition and treatment of ADEs in a generalizable manner - applicable in hospital environments using electronic medical records.            ",Outpatient Adverse Drug Effect Alerting System Using Admission H&P Notes,8796404,R36HS023485,[' '],AHRQ,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R36,2015,41626,0.011203275258729736
"Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Timely reporting and effective learning from medical incidents is considered an effective way in developing strategies for reducing medical errors. Utilizing an innovative a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach combining with case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques, we propose to develop a knowledgebase and learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, linking historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews on patient safety.

"Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A complete patient problem list is the cornerstone of the problem-oriented medical record. It serves as a valuable tool for providers assessing a patient's clinical status and succinctly communicates this information between providers. Accurate problem lists drive clinical decision support tools that improve quality, and an accurate problem list has been associated with higher quality care. Accurate problem lists are also critical for establishing accurate phenotypes for research and supporting quality improvement; however, problem lists in electronic health records are routinely incomplete. In this study, we propose to develop and validate problem inference algorithms to identify problems potentially missing from patient problem lists, and to conduct a randomized trial of these algorithms, studying their effects on quality of care. We call our approach IQ-MAPLE. Our project has three specific aims: 1) develop problem inference algorithms for heart, lung, and blood conditions, 2) implement problem inference alerts and optimize the workflow at four sites and 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial of the problem inference alerts, measuring the acceptance rate of alerts, the direct effect on problem list completeness and, critically, downstream impact of the alerts on key clinical quality measures, including both process and outcomes across a range of heart, lung and blood conditions. If successful, IQ-MAPLE will improve problem list accuracy, which has significant downstream implications: More accurate clinical decision support: Most clinical decision support is disease-oriented and, as such, depends on an accurate problem list. When problems are missing, opportunities to provide support to the clinician are missed, and quality suffers. Better quality measurement: Quality measurement today is often inaccurate, as patients are omitted from measures due to incomplete information on their clinical problems. A more accurate problem list would, in turn, lead to more accurate quality measurement. More accurate research: Clinical, translational and even basic science and genomic research increasingly use EHR data, particularly to identify patients with disease phenotypes, generally using problem lists. When problems are missing, the accuracy of research suffers. Better patient care: Secondary benefits aside, the problem list is, fundamentally, a tool for organizing patient care and communicating among providers. A more accurate, problem list supports these goals. The IQ-MAPLE rules, and our best practices for implementing them, will be freely available, ensuring broad dissemination of these benefits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An accurate, complete clinical problem list the cornerstone of a problem-oriented medical record, and research shows that accurate problem lists improve healthcare quality; however, problem lists are often incomplete. In this study, we will develop and evaluate an intervention to identify gaps in problem lists for patients with heart, lung, and blood conditions.

"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is the predominant method for screening for colorectal cancer in the US. Yet, its effectiveness in screening is limited by variation in performance. For example, the rate at which physicians detect cancer precursors called adenomas during a colonoscopy has been shown to vary three-fold from one physician to another. A patient whose colonoscopy is performed by a physician with a low adenoma detection rate has a higher risk of subsequent colorectal cancer.  Our proposal centers on measuring, understanding, and improving colonoscopy quality. The major innovation of this work is to use natural language processing (NLP) to measure the quality of colonoscopy. NLP is a field of computer science in which a computer is trained to ""read"" text to identify relevant data We developed and validated the first NLP-based computer software application (C-QUAL) that analyzes colonoscopy and associated pathology reports. Our primary quality measure is adenoma detection rate because it is a common, validated measure that is linked to colorectal cancer incidence. However, we also use a number of secondary quality measures. We applied C-QUAL to almost 25,000 colonoscopy reports in one health system and found large variation in physician's performance on the quality measures. Building on this prior work, our goal is to use C-QUAL to measure colonoscopy quality across a spectrum of US practice environments, to understand what drives variation in colonoscopy quality, and to improve colonoscopy quality. In Aim 1, we propose to use the C-QUAL tool to measure performance in 4 diverse health care systems. This will be one of the largest assessments of the variation in adenoma detection rates and will span different geographic regions, payment systems, and practice settings. In Aim 2, we seek to understand why there is variation in quality. We will survey providers at the 4 health care systems about factors that might affect quality. We will link those survey results to the adenoma detection rates assessed in Aim 1 and look for key associations. It is assumed, but not proven, that providing feedback to physicians on colonoscopy quality will improve care. In Aim 3, we assess whether feedback to physicians does drive quality improvement and, building on Aim 2, explore which types of physicians may respond to feedback. Our proposal is the first to use this innovative method to measure colonoscopy quality and to use the quality scores to decrease the variation in colonoscopy performance. Together the results of the 3 aims are consistent with the NCI's focus on improving the quality of colorectal cancer screening.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and provide physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.                  ",Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing,8641674,R01CA168959,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'payment', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2014,547410,-0.005164278781927201
"Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams  PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our previous studies provide support that such deviations indicate clinically important events at false alert rates below 50%, which is very promising. We propose to further improve the new methodology, and build a real-time monitoring and alerting system integrated with production electronic medical records. We propose an evaluation of the system using physicians' assessment of alerts raised by our real-time system for intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in the intensive care unit (ICU). This project develops and evaluates a new clinical monitoring and alerting framework that uses electronic medical records and machine-learning methods to send alerts concerning clinical decisions in the ICU that are unexpected given the clinical context and may represent medical errors.                ",Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams,8641014,R01GM088224,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Production', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Stream', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'design', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'liver transplantation', 'multidisciplinary', 'prototype', 'public health relevance']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,580180,0.03702314296611719
"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing. The end goal of this project is to meet the competing demands of providing patients with both privacy and accurate predictive models based on clinical history and genetics.

"BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): IBM estimates that 30% of the entire data in the world is medical information. Medical images occupy a significant portion of medical records with approximately 100 million scans in US and growing every year. In addition, the data size from each scan steadfastly increases as the image resolution improves. These BigData are not structured and due to lack of standardized imaging protocols, they are highly heterogeneous with different spatial resolutions, contrasts, slice orientations, etc. In this project, we will deelop a technology to structure and search medical imaging information, which will make the past data available for education and evidence-based clinical decision-making. In this grant, we will focus on brain MRI, which comprises the largest portion of MRI data. The target community will be physicians who make decisions and the patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries. Currently, radiological image data are stored in clinical database called PACS. The image data in PACS are not structured. Consequently, once the diagnosis of a patient is completed, most of the data in PACS are currently discarded in the archive. Radiologists rely on their experience and education to reach medical decisions. This is a typical problem in medical practice that calls for objective evidence-based medicine. There are many ongoing attempts to structure the text fields of PACS, which include natural language processing of free-text radiological reports, clinical information, and diagnosis. In our approach, we propose to structure the image data, not text fields, to support direct search of images. Namely, physicians will submit an image of a new patient and search past images with similar anatomical phenotypes. Then, the clinical reports of the retrieved data will be compiled for a statistical report of the diagnosis and prognosis. We believe this image structuration is the key to ""unlock the vast amounts of information currently stored"" in PACS and use them for education and modern evidence-based medical decisions. The specific aims are; Objective 1: To develop and test the accuracy of high-throughput image structuration technologies Objective 2: To develop and test the image search engine Objective 3: Capacity Building Requirement: To develop prototype cloud system for data structuration / search services for research and educational purposes                  n/a",BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data,8664845,R01EB017638,"['Archives', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'beneficiary', 'clinical decision-making', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'outcome forecast', 'prototype', 'radiologist']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,214609,0.009267329501830965
"Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physician progress notes contain information essential to patient care, including findings from history and physical exam, interpretation of tests, assessment and treatment plans. However in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians spend more time creating them, which has led to the use of time-saving measures such as copy/paste and templates that have degraded note accuracy and quality. This threatens the usefulness of notes not only for their most important use-patient care-but also for research, quality improvement, and in supporting reimbursement. To address these problems, we propose a project with the following specific aims: 1. To refine and implement a new voice-generated enhanced electronic note system (VGEENS) integrating voice recognition with natural language processing and links to the electronic medical record (EMR) to improve note accuracy and timeliness. 2. To evaluate VGEENS using a randomized trial with 30 internal medicine physicians in each arm to assess electronic note accuracy, quality, timeliness, and user satisfaction. Intervention physicians will use VGEENS, while the control physicians will continue with note creation as they normally would. This novel approach has the potential to improve note accuracy while reducing delays in making progress notes in EMRs available to other clinicians. It leverages rapidly improving voice recognition and NLP technologies to permit physicians to use a natural, fast method-human voice-to convey their observation and thoughts into the EMR record.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physician documentation of a patient visit contains information that is used in that patient's care. This information includes findings from a patient' history and physical exam, interpretation of necessary tests, the problem assessment and treatment plan. However, in the transition from paper to electronic physician notes, many physicians are spending more time creating these notes. This has led to use of time-saving measures that have degraded the accuracy and ease of use of patient notes. By the end of this project, we expect to have developed, used and evaluated a new method for creating electronic physician notes that both improve accuracy and timely availability of inpatient progress notes.            ","Improving Accuracy of Electronic Notes Using A Faster, Simpler Approach",8805997,R21HS023631,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2014,154347,0.016489328054229646
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,8821956,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2014,449993,0.007177096688978056
"Automated Dynamic Lists for Efficient Electronic Health Record Management DESCRIPTION (provided by APPLICANT): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to develop a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer. To establish the merit and feasibility of such a system, we will work on the following objectives: 1) create a reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute Cancer Clinics (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts; 2) develop a prototype to automatically extract medical problems and allergies, implementing a novel stepwise hybrid approach to maximize sensitivity first, and also enhance positive predictive value; and 3) test the prototype with the aforementioned reference standard, using a cross-validation approach for training and testing. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services incentive payments.

"Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Timely reporting and effective learning from medical incidents is considered an effective way in developing strategies for reducing medical errors. Utilizing an innovative a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach combining with case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques, we propose to develop a knowledgebase and learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, linking historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews on patient safety. We envision that the innovative approach will facilitate timely, quality reporting and learning from the incidents and ultimately cultivating a just and learning culture of patient safety.            ",Learning from patient safety events: A case base tool kit,8818528,R01HS022895,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2014,249655,0.04106074004810893
"Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A complete patient problem list is the cornerstone of the problem-oriented medical record. It serves as a valuable tool for providers assessing a patient's clinical status and succinctly communicates this information between providers. Accurate problem lists drive clinical decision support tools that improve quality, and an accurate problem list has been associated with higher quality care. Accurate problem lists are also critical for establishing accurate phenotypes for research and supporting quality improvement; however, problem lists in electronic health records are routinely incomplete. In this study, we propose to develop and validate problem inference algorithms to identify problems potentially missing from patient problem lists, and to conduct a randomized trial of these algorithms, studying their effects on quality of care. We call our approach IQ-MAPLE. Our project has three specific aims: 1) develop problem inference algorithms for heart, lung, and blood conditions, 2) implement problem inference alerts and optimize the workflow at four sites and 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial of the problem inference alerts, measuring the acceptance rate of alerts, the direct effect on problem list completeness and, critically, downstream impact of the alerts on key clinical quality measures, including both process and outcomes across a range of heart, lung and blood conditions. If successful, IQ-MAPLE will improve problem list accuracy, which has significant downstream implications: More accurate clinical decision support: Most clinical decision support is disease-oriented and, as such, depends on an accurate problem list. When problems are missing, opportunities to provide support to the clinician are missed, and quality suffers. Better quality measurement: Quality measurement today is often inaccurate, as patients are omitted from measures due to incomplete information on their clinical problems. A more accurate problem list would, in turn, lead to more accurate quality measurement. More accurate research: Clinical, translational and even basic science and genomic research increasingly use EHR data, particularly to identify patients with disease phenotypes, generally using problem lists. When problems are missing, the accuracy of research suffers. Better patient care: Secondary benefits aside, the problem list is, fundamentally, a tool for organizing patient care and communicating among providers. A more accurate, problem list supports these goals. The IQ-MAPLE rules, and our best practices for implementing them, will be freely available, ensuring broad dissemination of these benefits.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An accurate, complete clinical problem list the cornerstone of a problem-oriented medical record, and research shows that accurate problem lists improve healthcare quality; however, problem lists are often incomplete. In this study, we will develop and evaluate an intervention to identify gaps in problem lists for patients with heart, lung, and blood conditions. If successful, this system should improve problem list completeness and, ultimately, the quality of care delivered to patients.            ",Improving Quality by Maintaining Accurate Problem Lists in the EHR (IQ-MAPLE),8669579,R01HL122225,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Aneurysm', 'Basic Science', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New England', 'Nurses', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem-Oriented Medical Records', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'knowledge base', 'neglect', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2014,590279,0.0004411086129647086
"Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The large and growing size of the healthcare system makes it imperative to understand what is happening to us, the recipients of healthcare, to be able to efficiently conduct research to improve healthcare delivery and to improve the state of biomedicine by advancing its science. i2b2, ""Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside"" seeks to provide this instrumentation using the informational by products of healthcare and the biological materials accumulated through the delivery of healthcare. This complements existing efforts to create prospective cohort studies or trials outside the delivery of routine healthcare. In the first round of i2b2, we demonstrated that we could identify known adverse events and phenotypically select and then genotype patients for genetic association at approximately 1/10* of the price and less than l/10 of the time usually entailed to develop such populations for study. The challenge we have set ourselves for the next methodological challenge in i2b2 is the development of Virtual Cohort Studies (VCS) encompassing the population of a healthcare system as study subjects and asking questions of comparative effectiveness, unforeseen adverse events and identification of clinically relevant subpopulations including both clinical and genome-scale measures. We will be comparing the results of the VCS to those of carefully planned and executed cohort studies such as the Framingham Heart Study. VCS will require multiple methodological advances and tools development including in the disciplines of natural language processing, temporal reasoning, predictive modeling, biostatistics and machine learning. VCS methods will be tested by two driving biology projects, the first studying a collection of autoimmune diseases and the second type 2 diabetes. In both projects, VCS methods will be applied to investigate the components of cardiovascular risk from the genetic to the epigenetic and including the full range of clinical history including medications exposure. A systems/integrative approach will be taken to identify commonalities in these risk profiles across these disparate disease domains. VCS methods will be shared with i2b2 user community under open source governance while i2b2 user community contributions are folded into the i2b2 toolkit.

This task is formidable because of large variability of the vast numbers of patient attributes with the added complexity of sequences of patient encounters evolving over time. Epidemiological considerations such as confounding by indication for treatment also come into play. The objective of this research effort is to (1) create a modular test bed that uses a ""big data"" systems architecture to support research in rapid individualized prediction of outcomes from large clinical repositories and (2) to  explore various approaches to making ""pragmatic"" near-term predictions of outcomes. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database (VINCI), a research database with records of tens of millions of patients, we will explore two synergistic strategies for rapidly finding a cohort of patients that are similar enough to an index  patient to predict near-term treatment response and/or adverse effects in an elastic cloud environment: 1) use of temporal alignment of critical events including use of gene sequence alignment methods to relax requirements for exact temporal matching; and, 2) use of conceptual distance metrics to model the degree of content similarity of case records. The initial domain of application will be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The approach will apply open source ""big data"" methodologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo, to store and filter ""medical log"" files. The content of these ""logs"" will be processed by a combination with strategies including conceptual markup of events using natural language processing tools, matching of event streams, and statistical data mining methods to rapidly retrieve and identify patients that are sufficiently similar to an index case to be able to make personalized yet pragmatic clinical predictions of outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This proposal studies how to use experience of past patients, stored in electronic medical records systems, to help clinicians make practical decisions on the care of complex patients with type 1 diabetes. Research applies methods adapted from Internet search engines and from studies of the human genome to determine what it means for one patient's disease experiences to be similar to and relevant to another's. n/a",Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictio,8599828,R01GM108346,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Visualization software', 'Vocabulary', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer type', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'medical information system', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'performance tests', 'processing speed', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sugar', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2013,568249,0.013882044246008654
"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.

"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing No abstract available  Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and test methods of physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.

"BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): IBM estimates that 30% of the entire data in the world is medical information. Medical images occupy a significant portion of medical records with approximately 100 million scans in US and growing every year. In addition, the data size from each scan steadfastly increases as the image resolution improves. These BigData are not structured and due to lack of standardized imaging protocols, they are highly heterogeneous with different spatial resolutions, contrasts, slice orientations, etc. In this project, we will deelop a technology to structure and search medical imaging information, which will make the past data available for education and evidence-based clinical decision-making. In this grant, we will focus on brain MRI, which comprises the largest portion of MRI data. The target community will be physicians who make decisions and the patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries. Currently, radiological image data are stored in clinical database called PACS. The image data in PACS are not structured. Consequently, once the diagnosis of a patient is completed, most of the data in PACS are currently discarded in the archive. Radiologists rely on their experience and education to reach medical decisions. This is a typical problem in medical practice that calls for objective evidence-based medicine. There are many ongoing attempts to structure the text fields of PACS, which include natural language processing of free-text radiological reports, clinical information, and diagnosis. In our approach, we propose to structure the image data, not text fields, to support direct search of images. Namely, physicians will submit an image of a new patient and search past images with similar anatomical phenotypes. Then, the clinical reports of the retrieved data will be compiled for a statistical report of the diagnosis and prognosis. We believe this image structuration is the key to ""unlock the vast amounts of information currently stored"" in PACS and use them for education and modern evidence-based medical decisions. The specific aims are; Objective 1: To develop and test the accuracy of high-throughput image structuration technologies Objective 2: To develop and test the image search engine Objective 3: Capacity Building Requirement: To develop prototype cloud system for data structuration / search services for research and educational purposes                  n/a",BIGDATA Small Project Structurization and Direct Search of Medical Image Data,8599843,R01EB017638,"['Archives', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'beneficiary', 'clinical decision-making', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'outcome forecast', 'prototype', 'radiologist']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,224942,0.009267329501830965
"Automated Dynamic Lists for Efficient Electronic Health Record Management     DESCRIPTION (provided by APPLICANT): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to develop a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer. To establish the merit and feasibility of such a system, we will work on the following objectives: 1) create a reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute Cancer Clinics (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts; 2) develop a prototype to automatically extract medical problems and allergies, implementing a novel stepwise hybrid approach to maximize sensitivity first, and also enhance positive predictive value; and 3) test the prototype with the aforementioned reference standard, using a cross-validation approach for training and testing. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services incentive payments. Clinacuity will further extend the commercial potential of the system and it is output, using modular design principles allowing utilization of each module independently, and enhancing its local adaptability for easier deployment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical errors cause numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many could be prevented. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information such as entries in electronic lists of problems and allergies. Such lists are available in most electronic health records, but they require manual management and are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. On the other hand, clinical text reports contain the majority of the patient information, including problems and allergies. The overall goal of this project is to develop a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the electronic health record.           ",Automated Dynamic Lists for Efficient Electronic Health Record Management,8590856,R41CA180190,"['Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Incentives', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predictive Value', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'commercial application', 'computerized physician order entry', 'design', 'improved', 'novel', 'payment', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance']",NCI,"CLINACUITY,INC.",R41,2013,195683,-0.03095064550417619

"Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The large and growing size of the healthcare system makes it imperative to understand what is happening to us, the recipients of healthcare, to be able to efficiently conduct research to improve healthcare delivery and to improve the state of biomedicine by advancing its science. i2b2, ""Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside"" seeks to provide this instrumentation using the informational by products of healthcare and the biological materials accumulated through the delivery of healthcare. This complements existing efforts to create prospective cohort studies or trials outside the delivery of routine healthcare. In the first round of i2b2, we demonstrated that we could identify known adverse events and phenotypically select and then genotype patients for genetic association at approximately 1/10* of the price and less than l/10 of the time usually entailed to develop such populations for study. The challenge we have set ourselves for the next methodological challenge in i2b2 is the development of Virtual Cohort Studies (VCS) encompassing the population of a healthcare system as study subjects and asking questions of comparative effectiveness, unforeseen adverse events and identification of clinically relevant subpopulations including both clinical and genome-scale measures. We will be comparing the results of the VCS to those of carefully planned and executed cohort studies such as the Framingham Heart Study. VCS will require multiple methodological advances and tools development including in the disciplines of natural language processing, temporal reasoning, predictive modeling, biostatistics and machine learning. VCS methods will be tested by two driving biology projects, the first studying a collection of autoimmune diseases and the second type 2 diabetes. In both projects, VCS methods will be applied to investigate the components of cardiovascular risk from the genetic to the epigenetic and including the full range of clinical history including medications exposure. A systems/integrative approach will be taken to identify commonalities in these risk profiles across these disparate disease domains. VCS methods will be shared with i2b2 user community under open source governance while i2b2 user community contributions are folded into the i2b2 toolkit.

"SmartTool for Anomaly Detection in Radiotherapy Treatment Plan Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Adverse events and medical errors result in thousands of accidental deaths and over one million excess injuries each year. To avoid medical errors in radiation cancer treatment, careful attention needs to be made to ensure accurate implementation of the intended treatment plan. We propose a SmartTool to automatically detect and highlight potential errors in a radiotherapy treatment plan, in real time and before its execution. SmartTool will double check all the treatment parameters in the background against a previously built Predictive Model of a Medical Error (PMME) and flag the operator, [post human QA,] if there is a discrepancy in the treatment plan, by stopping execution, highlighting the outlier treatment parameter and prompting human intervention. To build the PMME we will mine the dataset of previously treated cancer patients, by clustering the data in the groups based on treatment parameter similarity, labeling the clusters and using an innovative algorithm to build a highly accurate anomaly detection tool. PMME will also be dynamically updated [to include new treatment data instances coming in to the system, and updating the model should any treatment flags be identified as false positive or false negative]. The vastly innovative aspect of SmartTool is in the novel use of machine learning techniques to automatically build an anomaly prediction model on unlabeled data (customarily a labeled data is required to build a predictive model) and provide an automatic, real time and unobtrusive intelligent computational treatment checking algorithm. Moreover, having an analytical model of an outlier/anomaly offers the capability to describe the conditions of the outlier being created and is the essential in gaining investigative (and medical) insight in what went wrong and how to improve the process in the future. SmartTool can also be applied in a variety of other medical areas (e.g. predicting errors in pharmacy, laboratory data, and treatment procedure data), to detect anomalies and describe them, offering potential novel medical discoveries and a prospect of saving thousands more lives, with a vast commercialization aspect.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposal is aimed at promoting research and development in biomedical computational science and technology that is consistent with the objective of the NIH and NCI to support rapid progress in areas of scientific opportunity in biomedical research, and enhancing the public health. If the project is successfully completed, this proof of concept study will result in a valuable health information technology tool for automatic detection of catastrophic errors in cancer radiotherapy, which adds another safeguard for patient safety.            The proposal is aimed at promoting research and development in biomedical computational science and technology that is consistent with the objective of the NIH and NCI to support rapid progress in areas of scientific opportunity in biomedical research, and enhancing the public health.

The challenge we have set ourselves for the next methodological challenge in i2b2 is the development of Virtual Cohort Studies (VCS) encompassing the population of a healthcare system as study subjects and asking questions of comparative effectiveness, unforeseen adverse events and identification of clinically relevant subpopulations including both clinical and genome-scale measures. We will be comparing the results of the VCS to those of carefully planned and executed cohort studies such as the Framingham Heart Study. VCS will require multiple methodological advances and tools development including in the disciplines of natural language processing, temporal reasoning, predictive modeling, biostatistics and machine learning. VCS methods will be tested by two driving biology projects, the first studying a collection of autoimmune diseases and the second type 2 diabetes. In both projects, VCS methods will be applied to investigate the components of cardiovascular risk from the genetic to the epigenetic and including the full range of clinical history including medications exposure. A systems/integrative approach will be taken to identify commonalities in these risk profiles across these disparate disease domains. VCS methods will be shared with i2b2 user community under open source governance while i2b2 user community contributions are folded into the i2b2 toolkit. Public Health Relevance: The i2b2 model of using existing clinical data for high throughput, cost effective, and timely research promises to rapidly leverage our nation's ability to better understand the existing disease burden and how best to achieve cost-effective clinical effectiveness, including new drug targets, new uses of existing drugs and improved management of existing disease.",Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2),8326732,U54LM008748,[' '],NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U54,2012,1282800,0.011618783563566111
"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying  factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal  treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological  research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public  records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained.  Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at  hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data  source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the  wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical  information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that  information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as  selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical  methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for  observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing  EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient  manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will  contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based  information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information  from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to  analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the  standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the  capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost.   The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to  extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and  use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both case-  control and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon  cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two  major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our  study will be compared to reported findings for validation. Project Narrative  According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various  types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of  cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is  one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language  processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from  existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related  epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.",An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records,8298614,R01CA141307,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American Cancer Society', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethics', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Observational Study', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prognostic indicator', 'public health research', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,56569,-0.002325803531884439
"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach  Abstract The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.

"Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        	Epidemiologic analyses of health care data can provide critical evidence on the effectiveness and safety of therapeutics. This is particularly vital during the transition from the point of regulatory approval through the early marketing of new drugs, a time when physicians, regulators and payers are all struggling with incomplete data. Health plans pay for these drugs without knowing how their effectiveness and safety compares with established alternatives, as new compounds are tested against placebos rather than active agents, and tested only in selected patients. Non-randomized studies in large healthcare databases can provide fast and less costly evidence on drug effects. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a small number of investigator-specified confounders often fail and may produce biased results.     We propose and have preliminary evidence that employing modern medical informatics algorithms that structure and search databases to empirically identify thousands of new covariates. These will then enter established propensity score-based models and so make far more effective use of the information contained in health care databases and electronic medical records (EMRs), resulting in more valid causal interpretations of treatment effects. We will:    - Develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims and EMR databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. The performance of these approaches will be evaluated in 6 example studies encompassing recent drug safety and comparative effectiveness problems, and will be implemented in multiple large claims databases supplemented by such data as lab values and EMR information in subgroups.    -- Develop novel methods for confounding adjustment based on textual information found in EMRs.    -- Expand the newly developed mining algorithms into a framework that integrates distributed database networks with uneven information content, similar to the Sentinel Network recently initiated by FDA.                            This project is likely to produce groundbreaking results at the interface of medicine, biomedical informatics, and epidemiologic methods. After completion of this project a library of documented and validated algorithms will be available to significantly improve confounder control in a range of healthcare databases. The theoretical foundation and the ready-to-use algorithms will likely lead to a fundamental shift in how databases contribute to the fast and accurate assessment of newly-marketed medications.            Large healthcare databases are used to assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a limited number of investigator-specific covariates often fail to produce unbiased results. We will develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims data and electronic medical records databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. This will result in improved causal inference on the comparative safety and effectiveness of newly marketed medications that is both less susceptible to investigator omissions and faster than conventional approaches.",Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects,8318797,R01LM010213,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Distributed Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly woman', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Head', 'Health Planning', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Scoring Method', 'Sentinel', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'data mining', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lectures', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'routine care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2012,383445,0.01234558978460019
"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.

"Detecting deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient [1]. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our preliminary studies provide support that such deviations often indicate clinically important events for which it is worthwhile to raise an alert. We propose an evaluation based on physician assessment of alerts that are generated from a retrospective set of intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in critical care by sending computer-based reminders and alerts to clinicians.

"Using medical records repositories to improve the alert system design    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Rapid and accurate alerting of concerning patient events and conditions remains an important problem in clinical practice. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge; hence such systems are typically built to cover only very specific conditions. In addition, it is difficult for an expert to foresee the performance of the deployed systems and their potential drawbacks, especially their false alarm rates. It is not uncommon that computer alerting systems are discarded or must undergo multiple costly modification cycles before they reach clinically acceptable levels of performance.    Electronic health record (EHR) repositories today provide an opportunity to test various theories and develop new computational solutions to various clinical problems. The objective of this project is to investigate methods for using the data in such repositories to assist in the development of alerting systems. The project goals include the building of an evidence-driven framework for the evaluation and optimization of alerting systems with the help of past data. The framework will be able to provide early feedback and future performance estimates of an alerting system before it is deployed, which is anticipated to decrease the expert effort required to design such a system and lead to a shorter alerting system design cycle. The evidence-driven framework will be tested and evaluated on multiple clinical conditions and compared to the performance of alerting rules currently deployed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). The project investigators consist of a multidisciplinary team with expertise in rule-based alerting in the hospital setting, clinical pharmacy, laboratory medicine, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, and knowledge based systems.           Project Narrative: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors by sending computer-based reminders and alerts to clinicians.

"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,8055880,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2011,328942,-0.005479305433003927
"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION: Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained. Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost. The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both casecontrol and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our study will be compared to reported findings for validation.  Project Narrative According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.",An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records,8110041,R01CA141307,"['Affect', 'American Cancer Society', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cost', 'prevent']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,252298,-0.0023178751527217854
"Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The large and growing size of the healthcare system makes it imperative to understand what is happening to us, the recipients of healthcare, to be able to efficiently conduct research to improve healthcare delivery and to improve the state of biomedicine by advancing its science. i2b2, ""Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside"" seeks to provide this instrumentation using the informational by products of healthcare and the biological materials accumulated through the delivery of healthcare. This complements existing efforts to create prospective cohort studies or trials outside the delivery of routine healthcare. In the first round of i2b2, we demonstrated that we could identify known adverse events and phenotypically select and then genotype patients for genetic association at approximately 1/10* of the price and less than l/10 of the time usually entailed to develop such populations for study. The challenge we have set ourselves for the next methodological challenge in i2b2 is the development of Virtual Cohort Studies (VCS) encompassing the population of a healthcare system as study subjects and asking questions of comparative effectiveness, unforeseen adverse events and identification of clinically relevant subpopulations including both clinical and genome-scale measures. We will be comparing the results of the VCS to those of carefully planned and executed cohort studies such as the Framingham Heart Study. VCS will require multiple methodological advances and tools development including in the disciplines of natural language processing, temporal reasoning, predictive modeling, biostatistics and machine learning. VCS methods will be tested by two driving biology projects, the first studying a collection of autoimmune diseases and the second type 2 diabetes. In both projects, VCS methods will be applied to investigate the components of cardiovascular risk from the genetic to the epigenetic and including the full range of clinical history including medications exposure. A systems/integrative approach will be taken to identify commonalities in these risk profiles across these disparate disease domains. VCS methods will be shared with i2b2 user community under open source governance while i2b2 user community contributions are folded into the i2b2 toolkit. Public Health Relevance: The i2b2 model of using existing clinical data for high throughput, cost effective, and timely research promises to rapidly leverage our nation's ability to better understand the existing disease burden and how best to achieve cost-effective clinical effectiveness, including new drug targets, new uses of existing drugs and improved management of existing disease.",Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2),8144250,U54LM008748,[' '],NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U54,2011,2657626,0.011618783563566111
"Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        	Epidemiologic analyses of health care data can provide critical evidence on the effectiveness and safety of therapeutics. This is particularly vital during the transition from the point of regulatory approval through the early marketing of new drugs, a time when physicians, regulators and payers are all struggling with incomplete data. Health plans pay for these drugs without knowing how their effectiveness and safety compares with established alternatives, as new compounds are tested against placebos rather than active agents, and tested only in selected patients. Non-randomized studies in large healthcare databases can provide fast and less costly evidence on drug effects. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a small number of investigator-specified confounders often fail and may produce biased results.     We propose and have preliminary evidence that employing modern medical informatics algorithms that structure and search databases to empirically identify thousands of new covariates. These will then enter established propensity score-based models and so make far more effective use of the information contained in health care databases and electronic medical records (EMRs), resulting in more valid causal interpretations of treatment effects. We will:    - Develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims and EMR databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. The performance of these approaches will be evaluated in 6 example studies encompassing recent drug safety and comparative effectiveness problems, and will be implemented in multiple large claims databases supplemented by such data as lab values and EMR information in subgroups.    -- Develop novel methods for confounding adjustment based on textual information found in EMRs.    -- Expand the newly developed mining algorithms into a framework that integrates distributed database networks with uneven information content, similar to the Sentinel Network recently initiated by FDA.                            This project is likely to produce groundbreaking results at the interface of medicine, biomedical informatics, and epidemiologic methods. After completion of this project a library of documented and validated algorithms will be available to significantly improve confounder control in a range of healthcare databases. The theoretical foundation and the ready-to-use algorithms will likely lead to a fundamental shift in how databases contribute to the fast and accurate assessment of newly-marketed medications.            Large healthcare databases are used to assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a limited number of investigator-specific covariates often fail to produce unbiased results. We will develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims data and electronic medical records databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. This will result in improved causal inference on the comparative safety and effectiveness of newly marketed medications that is both less susceptible to investigator omissions and faster than conventional approaches.",Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects,8143550,R01LM010213,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Distributed Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly woman', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Head', 'Health Planning', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Scoring Method', 'Sentinel', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'data mining', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lectures', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'routine care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2011,389385,0.01234558978460019
"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,8136907,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2011,247887,-0.004497677983540655

"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.           PROGRAM NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies.

"Automated creation of clinical progress notes with machine learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical encounters require the creation of an enormous amount of documentation. This documentation is tedious, time-consuming, and, in practice, is usually created hours after the encounter has occurred. The requirement to create this documentation places a tremendous burden on the time of clinical staff, and due to pressing workloads, can lead to incorrect recall and clinical data errors. The project intends to prove that progress note portion of this documentation process can be automated by novel application of recent advances in machine learning. A software system will be built with Support Vector Machine theory at its core. The software system can learn from existing clinical progress notes, and then apply those learned method by auto-generating the subjective/analytical portions of the note. The project will also examine learnings from individual physician notes compared to collections of multiple physician notes in order to built a superior model. The project's impact on the quality, and cost, of care should be dramatic. Reductions in documentation error rates and increases in physician productivity equate to an incredible array of quantitative benefits. Qualitatively, the project should make providing healthcare a more enjoyable experience for all involved, given the reduction of administrative time on the part of the highly skilled clinical staff.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinical encounter documentation provides the detailed patient health data which enables all care providers to have an accurate picture of the patient's clinical activities.

"Natural Language Processing to Study Epidemiology of Statin Side Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-101: Informatics for post-marketing surveillance. The overall goal of this study is to develop a generalizable framework for studying medication side effects recorded in narrative medical documents. We will implement and test this system on the example of epidemiologic characterization of side effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (a.k.a. statins). Statins are the most commonly used class of medications for treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the U.S. In randomized clinical trials statins are associated only with a slight increase in adverse reactions and no increase in discontinuation of treatment compared to placebo. However, in clinical practice the rates of side effects and discontinuation appear significantly higher and represent a major barrier to a critical, potentially lifesaving therapy. For example, myalgias are reported to be relatively rare in clinical trials but are thought to be more common in clinical practice. Additionally, a number of other statin-associated complaints reported anecdotally but not well elucidated in clinical trials include depression, irritability, and memory loss among others. Most of these have been poorly epidemiologically characterized and their prevalence and risk factors remain unknown. Structured electronic medical record (EMR) and administrative data have been used to study medication side effects. However, structured data have important limitations. They may not contain temporal or causative information necessary to link particular problems to medications and may not be sufficiently granular to identify specific adverse reactions. Narrative EMR data, such as provider notes, can provide documentation of causative links between medication and adverse events at high levels of granularity. Natural language processing (NLP) is an emerging technology that enables computational abstraction of information from narrative medical documents. In prior work we have successfully applied natural language processing to abstract medication information from narrative provider notes, including medication intensification, medication non-adherence and medication discontinuation. We will leverage these tools and the extensive EMR infrastructure at Partners HealthCare to develop and test a natural language processing system to study medication side effects. We will validate this system on the example of studying epidemiology of adverse reactions to statins. The findings of this project will lay the foundation for an open-source system that can be used for post-marketing surveillance of medication side effects using narrative EMR data.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Frequency and risk factors for side effects of statins (medications used to treat high cholesterol) in everyday medical practice (as opposed to research studies) are not known.

"Multi-source clinical Question Answering system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   / Abstract (Limit: 1 page) Our proposal addresses the following challenge area: 06-LM-101* Intelligent Search Tool for Answering Clinical Questions. Develop new computational approaches to information retrieval that would allow a clinician or clinical researcher to pose a single query that would result in search of multiple data sources to produce a coherent response that highlights key relevant information which may signal new insights for clinical research or patient care. Information that could help a clinician diagnose or manage a health condition, or help a clinical researcher explore the significance of issues that arise during a clinical trial, is scattered across many different types of resources, such as paper or electronic charts, trial protocols, published biomedical articles, or best-practice guidelines for care. Develop artificial intelligence and information retrieval approaches that allow a clinician or researcher confronting complex patient problems to pose a single query that will result in a search that appears to ""understand"" the question, a search that inspects multiple databases and brings findings together into a useful answer. Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab. The questions usually asked either require information highly specific to their patient, e.g. the patient's lab results or previous history, answered by the patient's health record, or a more general type of information usually answered through generally available information sources. QA systems enhance the results of search engines by providing a concise summary of relevant information along with source hits. PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) is the most ubiquitous biomedical search engine, however because it is a search engine the information retrieved is based on keyword searches and is not presented in a form for immediate consumption; the user has to drill down into the content of the webpages to find the facts/statements of interest. Moreover, the information that the clinician needs is likely to be of different types, for example a definition of a syndrome in combination with specific actions triggered by a particular diagnosis for a particular patient. Such information resides in different sources - encyclopedic and the EMR - and has to be dynamically accessed and presented to the user in an easily digestible format. We propose to develop a unified platform for clinical QA from multiple sources of clinical and biomedical narrative that implements semantic processing of the questions by fusing two existing technologies - the Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. The specific research questions we are aiming to answer are: ""How much effort is required to port a general semantic QA system to the clinical domain? How much additional domain-specific training is required? ""What is the accuracy of such a system? Question Answering in the clinical domain is an emerging area of research. The challenges in the field are mainly attributed to the number of components that require domain specific training along with strict system requirements in terms of high precision and recall complemented by an accessible and user-friendly presentation. Our approach to overcome them is to re-use components already in place as part of Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. Our approach is innovative in bringing together information from encyclopedic sources and the EMR to present it into a unified form to the clinician at the point of care or the investigator in the lab. The technology for that is based on semantic language processing which aims at ""understanding"" the meaning of the question and the narrative. Our proposed system holds the potential to impact quality of healthcare and translational research. Our approach is feasible because it uses content already in the EMR at the Mayo Clinic along with general medical knowledge from multiple readily-available resources. The proposed system will be built off mature and tested components allowing a fast and robust delivery cycle. Our unique integration of technologies together with sophisticated statistical machine learning algorithms applied to rich linguistic knowledge about events, contradictions, semantic structure, and question-types, will allow us to build a system which significantly extends the range of possible question types and responses available to clinicians, and seamlessly fuses these to generate a response. Our proposed work represents a high impact area that has the potential to improve healthcare delivery because it addresses needs that have been well-documented and studied (Ely et al., 2005). We aim to provide a unified multi-source solution for semantic retrieval, access and summarization of relevant information at the point of care or the lab. As such, the proposed cQA has the potential to play a vital and important decision- support role for the physician or the biomedical investigator.

"Detecting deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient [1]. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our preliminary studies provide support that such deviations often indicate clinically important events for which it is worthwhile to raise an alert. We propose an evaluation based on physician assessment of alerts that are generated from a retrospective set of intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in critical care by sending computer-based reminders and alerts to clinicians.

"Using medical records repositories to improve the alert system design    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Rapid and accurate alerting of concerning patient events and conditions remains an important problem in clinical practice. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge; hence such systems are typically built to cover only very specific conditions. In addition, it is difficult for an expert to foresee the performance of the deployed systems and their potential drawbacks, especially their false alarm rates. It is not uncommon that computer alerting systems are discarded or must undergo multiple costly modification cycles before they reach clinically acceptable levels of performance.    Electronic health record (EHR) repositories today provide an opportunity to test various theories and develop new computational solutions to various clinical problems. The objective of this project is to investigate methods for using the data in such repositories to assist in the development of alerting systems. The project goals include the building of an evidence-driven framework for the evaluation and optimization of alerting systems with the help of past data. The framework will be able to provide early feedback and future performance estimates of an alerting system before it is deployed, which is anticipated to decrease the expert effort required to design such a system and lead to a shorter alerting system design cycle. The evidence-driven framework will be tested and evaluated on multiple clinical conditions and compared to the performance of alerting rules currently deployed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). The project investigators consist of a multidisciplinary team with expertise in rule-based alerting in the hospital setting, clinical pharmacy, laboratory medicine, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, and knowledge based systems.           Project Narrative: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors by sending computer-based reminders and alerts to clinicians.

"Integrated discovery and hypothesis testing of new associations in rare diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare diseases are studied in isolated laboratories, forgotten by main stream pharmacological companies, and considered almost academic curiosities. Finding variables that correlate/cause rare diseases (a condition is rare when it affects less than 1 person per 2,000) is a difficult task. The low number of cases and the sparse nature of the reports make it difficult to obtain significant/meaningful statistical results. There are two ways to avoid these problems. The first is to integrate reported cases and associations to generate enough statistical power. The second way is to have an independent data set, big enough to cover rare cases. Each of the two methods has intrinsic problems. For instance, the search in the literature puts together different studies, each of them with their own biases in population, methodology and objectives. On the other hand, blind searches for associations in big databases introduce a large number of false positives due to multiple hypothesis testing.       These problems could be avoided by developing innovative methods that allow the integration of information and methodologies in the literature and longitudinal databases. To achieve this goal, we propose a team that combines expertise in natural language processing systems (Carol Friedman), electronic health records (George Hripcsak), statistics in combined databases and computational virology (Raul Rabadan). This team will generate an interdisciplinary approach to mine and integrate the literature and the dataset collected at Columbia/New York Presbyterian hospital. Identifying unusual correlations in rare diseases is the first step to understanding the origin of the diseases and to finding a cure for them. We hypothesize that we will develop effective methods aimed at improving our understanding of rare diseases by combining hypothesis testing and hypothesis discovery, and by integrating information from the literature and from the patient record to obtain increased statistical power.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"An NLP Approach to Generating Patient Record Summaries :  The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the manner in which physicians access, process and marshal medical information by providing them with an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to date summary of the information appearing in a patient record. At the point of patient care, physicians must often rapidly process a potentially overwhelming quantity of information pertaining to a patient. Failure to do so effectively may lead to provision of suboptimal care. Some electronic health record systems provide an automatically produced “cover sheet” geared to help physicians with a broad overview of a given patient, but the information is derived from the structured data fields in the patient record, ignoring the valuable narrative text entered by clinicians over time. We are building upon our prior work in summarization and natural language processing and leveraging our expertise in cognitive research studying information needs and decision making of clinicians to build a patient record summarizer that gathers information narrative (unstructured) as well as structured parts in the record. We focus on producing a summary for patients with kidney disease, as they often have a complex medical history with numerous conditions, procedures and medications. Providing a holistic, up-to-date summary of their chart would prove valuable to physicians in general and nephrologists in particular. The following three aims will be carried out: (1) conduct a formative study to determine how physicians prioritize and mentally represent relevant information when reviewing a patient chart; (2) create a set of automated methods to select salient pieces of information in the patient record and organize them into a coherent summary; and (3) evaluate the efficacy, efficiency and physician-user satisfaction associated with the use of the summarizer. A primary strength of this proposal is that we are addressing the problem of information overload, a bottleneck in the use of electronic health records, and evaluate the impact of our solution on clinicians’ actions and patients’ health outcomes. Furthermore, we propose to use novel natural language processing, knowledge-based and data mining methods to extract and organize salient information. Finally, we contribute to informatics research by extending the electronic health record functionalities to go beyond a simple documentation-entry system towards a useful reference and decision-making tool for physicians  Project Narrative We propose to design an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to-date summary of the information appearing in a patient record.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health.

"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION: Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained. Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost. The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both casecontrol and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our study will be compared to reported findings for validation. Narrative: According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of  cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is  one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language  processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from  existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related  epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.",An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records,7925776,R01CA141307,"['Affect', 'American Cancer Society', 'Breast', 'Cereals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cost', 'prevent']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,259993,-0.0023178751527217854

"Online Social Networking as an Alternative Information Source for Clinical Resear    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials and patient records have been the main information sources for clinical research. While well- designed clinical trials can produce high quality data, they are generally very expensive and time consuming. Prior studies have also shown that patients enrolled in clinical trials are not necessarily representative of the general patient population. Chart reviews, which rely on the patient records, avoid some of the drawbacks of the clinical trials approach. Although chart review studies are more labor intensive, new developments in structured data entry and natural language processing (NLP) are helping to automate the process. However, studies which use chart reviews are limited by the accuracy and completeness of the data in the records.       In the past decade, online social networks have grown exponentially. Some health-focused social network sites have attracted large numbers of users and begun accumulating large quantities of detailed clinical information. The PatientsLikeMe site, for instance, has about 3,200 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients worldwide, and includes about 5% of the ALS population in the US. Information gathered by online social networks is primarily intended for patients to share with each other. Such information has also begun to attract the attention of medical researchers.[3, 4]       Because using information from online social networks for medical research is a fairly new phenomenon, the value and limitation of this type of information source have not been systematically examined. To do so, we propose to conduct a comparison study of patient-contributed information from PatientsLikeMe and records from a large medical record data repository - the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) of the Partners Healthcare Systems. The proposed study will focus on ALS, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). The general goal is to explore how the medical record and online networking data differ, and if and how online networking data could complement the medical record data. The specific aims are:    1) Extract symptom and treatment information from the two different data sources.    2) Compare the prevalence of symptoms and treatments from the two information sources and analyze the difference.    3) Extract treatment response of prescription medications from PatientsLikeMe and analyze the confounding effect of the misunderstanding of medication indication.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network. This data source may complement and supplement the data from clinical trials and medical records, with a unique emphasis on patients' experience and perspectives.           The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network.

"Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The large and growing size of the healthcare system makes it imperative to understand what is happening to us, the recipients of healthcare, to be able to efficiently conduct research to improve healthcare delivery and to improve the state of biomedicine by advancing its science. i2b2, ""Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside"" seeks to provide this instrumentation using the informational by products of healthcare and the biological materials accumulated through the delivery of healthcare. This complements existing efforts to create prospective cohort studies or trials outside the delivery of routine healthcare. In the first round of i2b2, we demonstrated that we could identify known adverse events and phenotypically select and then genotype patients for genetic association at approximately 1/10* of the price and less than l/10 of the time usually entailed to develop such populations for study. The challenge we have set ourselves for the next methodological challenge in i2b2 is the development of Virtual Cohort Studies (VCS) encompassing the population of a healthcare system as study subjects and asking questions of comparative effectiveness, unforeseen adverse events and identification of clinically relevant subpopulations including both clinical and genome-scale measures. We will be comparing the results of the VCS to those of carefully planned and executed cohort studies such as the Framingham Heart Study. VCS will require multiple methodological advances and tools development including in the disciplines of natural language processing, temporal reasoning, predictive modeling, biostatistics and machine learning. VCS methods will be tested by two driving biology projects, the first studying a collection of autoimmune diseases and the second type 2 diabetes. In both projects, VCS methods will be applied to investigate the components of cardiovascular risk from the genetic to the epigenetic and including the full range of clinical history including medications exposure. A systems/integrative approach will be taken to identify commonalities in these risk profiles across these disparate disease domains. VCS methods will be shared with i2b2 user community under open source governance while i2b2 user community contributions are folded into the i2b2 toolkit. Public Health Relevance: The i2b2 model of using existing clinical data for high throughput, cost effective, and timely research promises to rapidly leverage our nation's ability to better understand the existing disease burden and how best to achieve cost-effective clinical effectiveness, including new drug targets, new uses of existing drugs and improved management of existing disease.",Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2),8012931,U54LM008748,[' '],NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U54,2010,3966606,0.011618783563566111
"Enhancing Clinical Effectiveness Research with Natural Language Processing of EMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To successfully use large linked clinical databases for comparative effectiveness research (CER) requires addressing some key informatics challenges associated with distributed, heterogeneous clinical data. Electronic networks of researchers are part of the solution because they can bridge the physical and organizational divides created by distinct health systems' individual electronic medical records (EMRs). In addition, informatics research has demonstrated the feasibility of automatically coding clinical text, enhancing the capacity to integrate both unstructured and non-standardized clinical data from EMRs. With this study, we propose to develop CER infrastructure, make broadly available the proven MediClass technology for automated classification of EMRs containing both coded data and text clinical notes, and demonstrate the potential of this infrastructure for addressing CER questions within the asthma and tobacco-using patient populations of 6 diverse health systems. Asthma and smoking each impose huge and modifiable burdens on the healthcare system, and multiple morbidities related to asthma and smoking have been targeted by the IOM and AHRQ as priority areas in efforts to improve the healthcare system through comparative effectiveness research. We propose to develop, deploy, operate and evaluate the CER HUB, an Internet-based platform for conducting CER, and to demonstrate its utility in studying clinical interventions in asthma and smoking. Researchers who register to use the HUB, beginning with the research team from the 6 participating study sites, will be able to use a secure website to configure and download MediClass applications addressing CER questions within their respective healthcare organizations, to contribute these IRB-approved, processed datasets back to a centralized data coordinating center to be pooled with data similarly processed from other healthcare organizations, and to use the pooled database to answer diverse comparative effectiveness questions of large, real-world populations. A central function of the CER HUB will be facilitating (through online, interactive tools) development of a shared library of MediClass knowledge modules that afford uniform, standardized coding of EMR data. This shared library of knowledge modules could permit researchers to assess effectiveness in multiple areas of healthcare and gain access to data otherwise locked away in text clinical notes. A goal of the CER HUB is to accelerate creation of standardized knowledge used to normalize heterogeneous EMR data as representations of clinical events for CER. During the project period we will conduct 2 studies using this infrastructure to address the effectiveness of interventions for asthmatics and tobacco users across the 6 participating health systems. As an ongoing resource, the HUB will provide a collaborative development platform for enhancing comparative effectiveness research in potentially any health care domain.      CER researchers can build software applications that will process their EMRs, creating standardized datasets permitting CER using a secure website to configure and download MediClass applications addressing CER questions within their respective healthcare organizations, to contribute these IRB-approved, processed datasets back to a centralized data coordinating center to be pooled with data similarly processed from other healthcare organizations, and to use the pooled database to answer diverse comparative effectiveness questions of large, real-world populations      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comparative effectiveness research (CER) requires that clinical data be in standard forms allowing multiple, large databases to be efficiently combined, and requires that all of the data be coded so that automated summarization of the data is possible. However, much of the clinical data necessary for CER is in the text clinical notes written by clinicians when caring for patients. We will build a centralized website where CER researchers can build software applications that will process their electronic medical records, including both the text and coded data, creating standardized datasets permitting comparative effectiveness research.

"Improving Outpatient Medication Lists Using Temporal Reasoning and Clinical Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate and complete medication lists are critical inputs to effective medication reconciliation to prevent medication prescribing and administration errors. Previous research aggregated structured medication data form multiple sources to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. Medications documented in clinical texts also need to be reconciled. However, most reconciliation methods currently have limited capability to process textual data and temporal information (e.g., dates, duration and status). Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and temporal reasoning to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists. Clinic notes and free-text ""comments"" fields in medication lists in an ambulatory electronic medical record system will be considered in the study. An NLP system and a temporal reasoning system will be adapted to automatically extract medication and associated temporal information from clinical texts and encode the medications using a controlled terminology. Multiple knowledge bases will be used to develop a mechanism to represent the timing of medication use, detect the changes (e.g., active or inactive), and then to organize medications into appropriate groups (e.g., by ingredient or by status). The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methods and tools in improving the process of medication   reconciliation will be assessed. Domain experts will serve as judges to assess the success of capturing, coding, and organizing the medications and temporal information and also to evaluate whether our methods are complementary to those currently used for medication management.           Accurate and complete medication information at the point of care is crucial for delivery of high-quality care and prevention of adverse events. Most previous studies aggregated structured medication data from EMR and CPOE (Computerized Physician Order Entry) systems to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. However, medications in non-structured narrative sources (such as clinic notes and free-text comments) must also be reconciled. Structured data presented in a standard, predictable form can be easily processed by a computer. By contrast, narrative data does not have a well-defined structure, so processing such data is very challenging. Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (any system that manipulates text) and temporal reasoning (e.g., identifying the timing of medication use) to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists.

"Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The medical record for a neuro-oncology patient is complex, consisting of typically a large number of both text and imaging data. It includes descriptions of prior observations, interpretations, and interventions which need to be integrated into decisions regarding current patient care. An appropriate review of a patient's medical record often requires that a physician review multiple clinical documents while mentally noting issues related to what the findings were, the chronology of events, spatial/temporal patterns of disease progression, the effects of interventions, and the possible causal lines of explanation of observed findings. Additionally, imaging data and imaging- derived conclusions are poorly integrated into patient care and management decisions. The physician also needs to filter out those pieces of information not related to the current clinical context of care. Given the time constraints, data complexity and data volume associated with chronic patient cases, an appropriate review of a patient's chart is in reality rarely performed. Additionally, the lack of tools for formalizing the representation of the accounts of current and prior cases impedes the development of clinical databases that can be ultimately used to learn patterns of disease.       This proposal addresses the development of a system for facilitating the review of clinical patient data intended to promote an orderly process of medical problem understanding and care. The specific aims of the proposal are summarized as follows: 1) Development of a backend tool to facilitate the structured representation of observations, events, and inferences stated within medical reports. 2) Development of an application interface for visualizing, navigating, and editing structured patient data. 3) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the application in the domain of neuro-oncology.       Relation to public health. If the goals of this proposal can be realized, neuro-oncologist should be able to more easily seek desired patient data and detect patterns of evidence as compared to the current mode of operation (HIS, RIS, PACS). The structuring tools should lead to improvements in the quality of clinical research databases.           Narrative Medical records for neuro-oncology patients are difficult to review due to volume and complexity of information. A novel system for partitioning data along the information axes of space, time, existence, and causality is proposed to improve navigation and assimilation of data within the medical record.",Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology,7877057,R01LM009961,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Assimilations', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Effectiveness', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Metric', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncologist', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'abstracting', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'physical state', 'satisfaction', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2010,771496,0.03504861522694502
"Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        	Epidemiologic analyses of health care data can provide critical evidence on the effectiveness and safety of therapeutics. This is particularly vital during the transition from the point of regulatory approval through the early marketing of new drugs, a time when physicians, regulators and payers are all struggling with incomplete data. Health plans pay for these drugs without knowing how their effectiveness and safety compares with established alternatives, as new compounds are tested against placebos rather than active agents, and tested only in selected patients. Non-randomized studies in large healthcare databases can provide fast and less costly evidence on drug effects. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a small number of investigator-specified confounders often fail and may produce biased results.     We propose and have preliminary evidence that employing modern medical informatics algorithms that structure and search databases to empirically identify thousands of new covariates. These will then enter established propensity score-based models and so make far more effective use of the information contained in health care databases and electronic medical records (EMRs), resulting in more valid causal interpretations of treatment effects. We will:    - Develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims and EMR databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. The performance of these approaches will be evaluated in 6 example studies encompassing recent drug safety and comparative effectiveness problems, and will be implemented in multiple large claims databases supplemented by such data as lab values and EMR information in subgroups.    -- Develop novel methods for confounding adjustment based on textual information found in EMRs.    -- Expand the newly developed mining algorithms into a framework that integrates distributed database networks with uneven information content, similar to the Sentinel Network recently initiated by FDA.                            This project is likely to produce groundbreaking results at the interface of medicine, biomedical informatics, and epidemiologic methods. After completion of this project a library of documented and validated algorithms will be available to significantly improve confounder control in a range of healthcare databases. The theoretical foundation and the ready-to-use algorithms will likely lead to a fundamental shift in how databases contribute to the fast and accurate assessment of newly-marketed medications.            Large healthcare databases are used to assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a limited number of investigator-specific covariates often fail to produce unbiased results. We will develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims data and electronic medical records databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. This will result in improved causal inference on the comparative safety and effectiveness of newly marketed medications that is both less susceptible to investigator omissions and faster than conventional approaches.",Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects,7940855,R01LM010213,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Distributed Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Head', 'Health Planning', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Scoring Method', 'Sentinel', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'data mining', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lectures', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'routine care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2010,417999,0.01234558978460019
"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,7941068,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2010,496075,-0.004497677983540655

"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.           PROGRAM NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance. We will evaluate the incremental benefit of structured data, narrative data, and temporally processed narrative data.           n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,7933293,R01LM006910,"['Address', 'Area', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Persons', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'satisfaction', 'syndromic surveillance']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,152617,0.003045811463893239
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7918614,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'natural language', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2009,185745,0.000973045645250029
"Natural Language Processing to Study Epidemiology of Statin Side Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-101: Informatics for post-marketing surveillance. The overall goal of this study is to develop a generalizable framework for studying medication side effects recorded in narrative medical documents. We will implement and test this system on the example of epidemiologic characterization of side effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (a.k.a. statins). Statins are the most commonly used class of medications for treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the U.S. In randomized clinical trials statins are associated only with a slight increase in adverse reactions and no increase in discontinuation of treatment compared to placebo. However, in clinical practice the rates of side effects and discontinuation appear significantly higher and represent a major barrier to a critical, potentially lifesaving therapy. For example, myalgias are reported to be relatively rare in clinical trials but are thought to be more common in clinical practice. Additionally, a number of other statin-associated complaints reported anecdotally but not well elucidated in clinical trials include depression, irritability, and memory loss among others. Most of these have been poorly epidemiologically characterized and their prevalence and risk factors remain unknown. Structured electronic medical record (EMR) and administrative data have been used to study medication side effects. However, structured data have important limitations. They may not contain temporal or causative information necessary to link particular problems to medications and may not be sufficiently granular to identify specific adverse reactions. Narrative EMR data, such as provider notes, can provide documentation of causative links between medication and adverse events at high levels of granularity. Natural language processing (NLP) is an emerging technology that enables computational abstraction of information from narrative medical documents. In prior work we have successfully applied natural language processing to abstract medication information from narrative provider notes, including medication intensification, medication non-adherence and medication discontinuation. We will leverage these tools and the extensive EMR infrastructure at Partners HealthCare to develop and test a natural language processing system to study medication side effects. We will validate this system on the example of studying epidemiology of adverse reactions to statins. The findings of this project will lay the foundation for an open-source system that can be used for post-marketing surveillance of medication side effects using narrative EMR data.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Frequency and risk factors for side effects of statins (medications used to treat high cholesterol) in everyday medical practice (as opposed to research studies) are not known.

"Multi-source clinical Question Answering system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   / Abstract (Limit: 1 page) Our proposal addresses the following challenge area: 06-LM-101* Intelligent Search Tool for Answering Clinical Questions. Develop new computational approaches to information retrieval that would allow a clinician or clinical researcher to pose a single query that would result in search of multiple data sources to produce a coherent response that highlights key relevant information which may signal new insights for clinical research or patient care. Information that could help a clinician diagnose or manage a health condition, or help a clinical researcher explore the significance of issues that arise during a clinical trial, is scattered across many different types of resources, such as paper or electronic charts, trial protocols, published biomedical articles, or best-practice guidelines for care. Develop artificial intelligence and information retrieval approaches that allow a clinician or researcher confronting complex patient problems to pose a single query that will result in a search that appears to ""understand"" the question, a search that inspects multiple databases and brings findings together into a useful answer. Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab. The questions usually asked either require information highly specific to their patient, e.g. the patient's lab results or previous history, answered by the patient's health record, or a more general type of information usually answered through generally available information sources. QA systems enhance the results of search engines by providing a concise summary of relevant information along with source hits. PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) is the most ubiquitous biomedical search engine, however because it is a search engine the information retrieved is based on keyword searches and is not presented in a form for immediate consumption; the user has to drill down into the content of the webpages to find the facts/statements of interest. Moreover, the information that the clinician needs is likely to be of different types, for example a definition of a syndrome in combination with specific actions triggered by a particular diagnosis for a particular patient. Such information resides in different sources - encyclopedic and the EMR - and has to be dynamically accessed and presented to the user in an easily digestible format. We propose to develop a unified platform for clinical QA from multiple sources of clinical and biomedical narrative that implements semantic processing of the questions by fusing two existing technologies - the Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. The specific research questions we are aiming to answer are: ""How much effort is required to port a general semantic QA system to the clinical domain? How much additional domain-specific training is required? ""What is the accuracy of such a system? Question Answering in the clinical domain is an emerging area of research. The challenges in the field are mainly attributed to the number of components that require domain specific training along with strict system requirements in terms of high precision and recall complemented by an accessible and user-friendly presentation. Our approach to overcome them is to re-use components already in place as part of Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. Our approach is innovative in bringing together information from encyclopedic sources and the EMR to present it into a unified form to the clinician at the point of care or the investigator in the lab. The technology for that is based on semantic language processing which aims at ""understanding"" the meaning of the question and the narrative. Our proposed system holds the potential to impact quality of healthcare and translational research. Our approach is feasible because it uses content already in the EMR at the Mayo Clinic along with general medical knowledge from multiple readily-available resources. The proposed system will be built off mature and tested components allowing a fast and robust delivery cycle. Our unique integration of technologies together with sophisticated statistical machine learning algorithms applied to rich linguistic knowledge about events, contradictions, semantic structure, and question-types, will allow us to build a system which significantly extends the range of possible question types and responses available to clinicians, and seamlessly fuses these to generate a response. Our proposed work represents a high impact area that has the potential to improve healthcare delivery because it addresses needs that have been well-documented and studied (Ely et al., 2005). We aim to provide a unified multi-source solution for semantic retrieval, access and summarization of relevant information at the point of care or the lab. As such, the proposed cQA has the potential to play a vital and important decision- support role for the physician or the biomedical investigator. (max 2-3 sentences) Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab.

"Detecting deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient [1]. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our preliminary studies provide support that such deviations often indicate clinically important events for which it is worthwhile to raise an alert. We propose an evaluation based on physician assessment of alerts that are generated from a retrospective set of intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases.

"Using medical records repositories to improve the alert system design    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Rapid and accurate alerting of concerning patient events and conditions remains an important problem in clinical practice. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge; hence such systems are typically built to cover only very specific conditions. In addition, it is difficult for an expert to foresee the performance of the deployed systems and their potential drawbacks, especially their false alarm rates. It is not uncommon that computer alerting systems are discarded or must undergo multiple costly modification cycles before they reach clinically acceptable levels of performance.    Electronic health record (EHR) repositories today provide an opportunity to test various theories and develop new computational solutions to various clinical problems. The objective of this project is to investigate methods for using the data in such repositories to assist in the development of alerting systems. The project goals include the building of an evidence-driven framework for the evaluation and optimization of alerting systems with the help of past data. The framework will be able to provide early feedback and future performance estimates of an alerting system before it is deployed, which is anticipated to decrease the expert effort required to design such a system and lead to a shorter alerting system design cycle. The evidence-driven framework will be tested and evaluated on multiple clinical conditions and compared to the performance of alerting rules currently deployed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). The project investigators consist of a multidisciplinary team with expertise in rule-based alerting in the hospital setting, clinical pharmacy, laboratory medicine, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, and knowledge based systems.           Project Narrative: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors by sending computer-based reminders and alerts to clinicians.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"An NLP Approach to Generating Patient Record Summaries :  The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the manner in which physicians access, process and marshal medical information by providing them with an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to date summary of the information appearing in a patient record. At the point of patient care, physicians must often rapidly process a potentially overwhelming quantity of information pertaining to a patient. Failure to do so effectively may lead to provision of suboptimal care. Some electronic health record systems provide an automatically produced “cover sheet” geared to help physicians with a broad overview of a given patient, but the information is derived from the structured data fields in the patient record, ignoring the valuable narrative text entered by clinicians over time. We are building upon our prior work in summarization and natural language processing and leveraging our expertise in cognitive research studying information needs and decision making of clinicians to build a patient record summarizer that gathers information narrative (unstructured) as well as structured parts in the record. We focus on producing a summary for patients with kidney disease, as they often have a complex medical history with numerous conditions, procedures and medications. Providing a holistic, up-to-date summary of their chart would prove valuable to physicians in general and nephrologists in particular. The following three aims will be carried out: (1) conduct a formative study to determine how physicians prioritize and mentally represent relevant information when reviewing a patient chart; (2) create a set of automated methods to select salient pieces of information in the patient record and organize them into a coherent summary; and (3) evaluate the efficacy, efficiency and physician-user satisfaction associated with the use of the summarizer. A primary strength of this proposal is that we are addressing the problem of information overload, a bottleneck in the use of electronic health records, and evaluate the impact of our solution on clinicians’ actions and patients’ health outcomes. Furthermore, we propose to use novel natural language processing, knowledge-based and data mining methods to extract and organize salient information. Finally, we contribute to informatics research by extending the electronic health record functionalities to go beyond a simple documentation-entry system towards a useful reference and decision-making tool for physicians  Project Narrative We propose to design an automatically generated, comprehensive, and up-to-date summary of the information appearing in a patient record.

"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians.

"Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have shown that the readability of the health information provided to consumers does not match their general reading levels (Rudd, Moeykens et al. 2000). Even with the efforts of healthcare providers and writers to make materials more readable, today most patient-oriented Web sites, pamphlets, drug-labels, and discharge instructions still require the consumer to have a tenth grade reading level or higher (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer et al. 2004). Not infrequently, however, consumer reading levels are as low as fourth grade. To address this problem, we propose developing a computer-based method for providing texts of appropriate readability to a consumer. Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive impact on reader comprehension. We will use as a test bed for our system a general internal medicine clinic and its diabetes patients. We will provide self-care materials to these patients. Relevance to public health: The proposed development of a readability assessment instrument and ""Plain English"" tool will help translating complex health materials into reader-appropriate texts. It has the potential of making the vast amount of available information in the health domain more accessible to the lay public.              n/a",Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts,7672256,R01DK075837,"['Address', 'Beds', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Labeling', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exercise', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health education', 'Home environment', 'Instruction', 'Internal Medicine', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Control', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Patients', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Smog', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computer program', 'computerized', 'fourth grade', 'improved', 'instrument', 'literacy', 'ninth grade', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'programs', 'tenth grade', 'tool', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2009,398216,-0.004651476983983982
"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Integrated discovery and hypothesis testing of new associations in rare diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare diseases are studied in isolated laboratories, forgotten by main stream pharmacological companies, and considered almost academic curiosities. Finding variables that correlate/cause rare diseases (a condition is rare when it affects less than 1 person per 2,000) is a difficult task. The low number of cases and the sparse nature of the reports make it difficult to obtain significant/meaningful statistical results. There are two ways to avoid these problems. The first is to integrate reported cases and associations to generate enough statistical power. The second way is to have an independent data set, big enough to cover rare cases. Each of the two methods has intrinsic problems. For instance, the search in the literature puts together different studies, each of them with their own biases in population, methodology and objectives. On the other hand, blind searches for associations in big databases introduce a large number of false positives due to multiple hypothesis testing.       These problems could be avoided by developing innovative methods that allow the integration of information and methodologies in the literature and longitudinal databases. To achieve this goal, we propose a team that combines expertise in natural language processing systems (Carol Friedman), electronic health records (George Hripcsak), statistics in combined databases and computational virology (Raul Rabadan). This team will generate an interdisciplinary approach to mine and integrate the literature and the dataset collected at Columbia/New York Presbyterian hospital. Identifying unusual correlations in rare diseases is the first step to understanding the origin of the diseases and to finding a cure for them. We hypothesize that we will develop effective methods aimed at improving our understanding of rare diseases by combining hypothesis testing and hypothesis discovery, and by integrating information from the literature and from the patient record to obtain increased statistical power. This will involve using natural language processing and statistical methods to mine both the literature and the electronic health record (EHR).           Project Narrative We will test reported associations in rare diseases and discover new ones by integrating information from the literature and from Electronic Health Records in hospitals.",Integrated discovery and hypothesis testing of new associations in rare diseases,7727710,R01LM010140,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Informatics', 'Information Theory', 'Kaposi Sarcoma', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Rare Diseases', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'blind', 'data mining', 'forgetting', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'longitudinal database', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'repository', 'research study', 'statistics', 'text searching', 'tool', 'virology', 'web site']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,533007,-0.014931433037415232
"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records    DESCRIPTION: Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained. Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost. The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both casecontrol and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our study will be compared to reported findings for validation.      Narrative: According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various types of cancer in the world during 2007. It is very important to identify risk factors of   cancers and to determine optimal treatments of cancers, and epidemiological study is   one of the methods to achieve it. This proposed study will use natural language   processing technologies to automatically extract fine-grained cancer information from   existing patient electronic medical records and use it to conduct cancer related   epidemiological studies, thus accelerating knowledge accumulation of cancer research.      SPECIAL REVIEW NOTE: In order to conform to the scientific objectives outlined in the program announcement RFA-GM-09-008, EUREKA applications submitted to the NCI were initially evaluated by a group of reviewers representing diverse scientific interests.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,7653874,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,357875,-0.005479305433003927

"Improving Public Health Grey Literature Access for the Public Health Workforce    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed project is to provide the public health (PH) workforce with improved access to high quality, relevant PH grey literature reports in order to positively impact the planning, conducting, and evaluating of PH interventions. The project will consist of two components: 1) continuation of user-focused technical system development, and 2) deployment and evaluation of this system's impact on the tasks of the PH workforce in county health departments.      The system will automatically harvest web-based grey literature reports (utilizing rules trained on input from PH professionals) and then produce rich summaries of PH grey literature reports using the model of essential elements of PH intervention reports validated by PH specialists (Turner et al, In Press). After developing a user interface that capitalizes on both natural language querying and the display of search results in a structured, model-based summary, the system will be introduced into several county health departments and evaluated to determine its impact on information flows and uses.      The project will include intrinsic evaluations of: 1) the appropriateness of the grey literature reports harvested by the system; 2) the quality and sufficiency of summaries representing the full reports based on the PH intervention model and; 3) retrieval results for users' queries using metrics of precision and recall. Extrinsic evaluation will be done in PH departments participating in the New York Academy of Medicine's ongoing study of the relationship between information and effectiveness. The research will provide baseline measures. We will evaluate: 1) the ease and frequency of use, perceptions of currency, accuracy, and completeness of retrieved reports by county PH personnel, and; 2) impact of the system's usage on information flows and uses based on internal outcome measures within the county health departments.

"Online Social Networking as an Alternative Information Source for Clinical Resear    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials and patient records have been the main information sources for clinical research. While well- designed clinical trials can produce high quality data, they are generally very expensive and time consuming. Prior studies have also shown that patients enrolled in clinical trials are not necessarily representative of the general patient population. Chart reviews, which rely on the patient records, avoid some of the drawbacks of the clinical trials approach. Although chart review studies are more labor intensive, new developments in structured data entry and natural language processing (NLP) are helping to automate the process. However, studies which use chart reviews are limited by the accuracy and completeness of the data in the records.       In the past decade, online social networks have grown exponentially. Some health-focused social network sites have attracted large numbers of users and begun accumulating large quantities of detailed clinical information. The PatientsLikeMe site, for instance, has about 3,200 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients worldwide, and includes about 5% of the ALS population in the US. Information gathered by online social networks is primarily intended for patients to share with each other. Such information has also begun to attract the attention of medical researchers.[3, 4]       Because using information from online social networks for medical research is a fairly new phenomenon, the value and limitation of this type of information source have not been systematically examined. To do so, we propose to conduct a comparison study of patient-contributed information from PatientsLikeMe and records from a large medical record data repository - the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) of the Partners Healthcare Systems. The proposed study will focus on ALS, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). The general goal is to explore how the medical record and online networking data differ, and if and how online networking data could complement the medical record data. The specific aims are:    1) Extract symptom and treatment information from the two different data sources.    2) Compare the prevalence of symptoms and treatments from the two information sources and analyze the difference.    3) Extract treatment response of prescription medications from PatientsLikeMe and analyze the confounding effect of the misunderstanding of medication indication.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network. This data source may complement and supplement the data from clinical trials and medical records, with a unique emphasis on patients' experience and perspectives.           The proposed project will investigate an emerging data source for clinical research: online social network.

"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.           Relevance The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application.

"Early Warning Method and Technologies for Improving Cancer Care and Targeted Inte    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substantial evidence gathered over the last 50 years shows that adherence poses a crucial barrier to effective treatment and survival for cancer and other chronic diseases. At least one in five cancer patients do not adhere to treatment regimen, with much higher disease-specific rates. This non-adherence, or deviation from the recommended and expected clinical path, can dramatically increase costs of care, hospitalizations, adverse outcomes and the chance of preventable death. What causes non-adherence to treatment regimens is currently not rigorously understood. Current adherence research methods largely rely on survey instruments that have limited scale and scope, provide lagging information that inhibits timely intervention, and offer little actionable information to help patients to adhere to their care regimens. Further, the nature and timing of intervention to improve adherence have not been researched in depth. With continuous changes in cancer treatment, newer proactive approaches and methods for surveillance of patient adherence and targeted interventions are needed. In this project, we examine the feasibility and validity of a novel approach that uses a computational model to glean fine-grained attributes of cancer patients from standard electronic medical records. Our preliminary work has shown that electronic records to contain free-form text describing patient sentiment, vitals, medical condition, side effects, social history and family status written by physicians, nurses, medical assistants, and other staff during every visit encounter. With the steady adoption of electronic medical records by clinicians across the US (currently 29% and rising at 12% per year), clinical notes found in electronic records offer a tantalizing source of insight into patient adherence and behavior. Current adherence research has not tapped this rich source of data, even though many disciplines including biomedical informatics have employed natural language processing and text-mining techniques to glean patterns in semi- structured biomedical data. We aim to employ similar but novel, scalable computational models to glean a rich set of risk factors for patient non-adherence from 1 million patient encounter records, corresponding to 24,050 patients that span a 10 year time-horizon. Our objectives are to estimate the risk of a patient's ability to adhere to a prescribed regimen and enable targeted and timely interventions by using computational analysis of unstructured and structured fields in standard clinical documentation.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We aim to show the feasibility of an early warning system that detects and estimates a cancer patient's risk of non-adherence to treatment regimens by analyzing unstructured text in standard medical records. This technology has tremendous relevance for improved quality of care, proactive management of chronic diseases and patient safety.                        Project Narrative We aim to show the feasibility of an early warning system that detects and estimates a cancer patient's risk of non-adherence to treatment regimens by analyzing unstructured text in standard medical records.

"Improving Outpatient Medication Lists Using Temporal Reasoning and Clinical Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate and complete medication lists are critical inputs to effective medication reconciliation to prevent medication prescribing and administration errors. Previous research aggregated structured medication data form multiple sources to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. Medications documented in clinical texts also need to be reconciled. However, most reconciliation methods currently have limited capability to process textual data and temporal information (e.g., dates, duration and status). Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and temporal reasoning to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists. Clinic notes and free-text ""comments"" fields in medication lists in an ambulatory electronic medical record system will be considered in the study. An NLP system and a temporal reasoning system will be adapted to automatically extract medication and associated temporal information from clinical texts and encode the medications using a controlled terminology. Multiple knowledge bases will be used to develop a mechanism to represent the timing of medication use, detect the changes (e.g., active or inactive), and then to organize medications into appropriate groups (e.g., by ingredient or by status). The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methods and tools in improving the process of medication   reconciliation will be assessed. Domain experts will serve as judges to assess the success of capturing, coding, and organizing the medications and temporal information and also to evaluate whether our methods are complementary to those currently used for medication management.           Accurate and complete medication information at the point of care is crucial for delivery of high-quality care and prevention of adverse events. Most previous studies aggregated structured medication data from EMR and CPOE (Computerized Physician Order Entry) systems to generate and maintain a reconciled medication list. However, medications in non-structured narrative sources (such as clinic notes and free-text comments) must also be reconciled. Structured data presented in a standard, predictable form can be easily processed by a computer. By contrast, narrative data does not have a well-defined structure, so processing such data is very challenging. Our goal is to pilot and test methodologies and applications in the fields of natural language processing (any system that manipulates text) and temporal reasoning (e.g., identifying the timing of medication use) to facilitate the use of electronic clinical texts in order to improve the ""correctness"" and ""completeness"" of medication lists.

"Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The medical record for a neuro-oncology patient is complex, consisting of typically a large number of both text and imaging data. It includes descriptions of prior observations, interpretations, and interventions which need to be integrated into decisions regarding current patient care. An appropriate review of a patient's medical record often requires that a physician review multiple clinical documents while mentally noting issues related to what the findings were, the chronology of events, spatial/temporal patterns of disease progression, the effects of interventions, and the possible causal lines of explanation of observed findings. Additionally, imaging data and imaging- derived conclusions are poorly integrated into patient care and management decisions. The physician also needs to filter out those pieces of information not related to the current clinical context of care. Given the time constraints, data complexity and data volume associated with chronic patient cases, an appropriate review of a patient's chart is in reality rarely performed. Additionally, the lack of tools for formalizing the representation of the accounts of current and prior cases impedes the development of clinical databases that can be ultimately used to learn patterns of disease.       This proposal addresses the development of a system for facilitating the review of clinical patient data intended to promote an orderly process of medical problem understanding and care. The specific aims of the proposal are summarized as follows: 1) Development of a backend tool to facilitate the structured representation of observations, events, and inferences stated within medical reports. 2) Development of an application interface for visualizing, navigating, and editing structured patient data. 3) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the application in the domain of neuro-oncology.       Relation to public health. If the goals of this proposal can be realized, neuro-oncologist should be able to more easily seek desired patient data and detect patterns of evidence as compared to the current mode of operation (HIS, RIS, PACS). The structuring tools should lead to improvements in the quality of clinical research databases.           Narrative Medical records for neuro-oncology patients are difficult to review due to volume and complexity of information.

"Analyzing Complex Healthcare Data to Determine Causality of Observed Drug Effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        	Epidemiologic analyses of health care data can provide critical evidence on the effectiveness and safety of therapeutics. This is particularly vital during the transition from the point of regulatory approval through the early marketing of new drugs, a time when physicians, regulators and payers are all struggling with incomplete data. Health plans pay for these drugs without knowing how their effectiveness and safety compares with established alternatives, as new compounds are tested against placebos rather than active agents, and tested only in selected patients. Non-randomized studies in large healthcare databases can provide fast and less costly evidence on drug effects. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a small number of investigator-specified confounders often fail and may produce biased results.     We propose and have preliminary evidence that employing modern medical informatics algorithms that structure and search databases to empirically identify thousands of new covariates. These will then enter established propensity score-based models and so make far more effective use of the information contained in health care databases and electronic medical records (EMRs), resulting in more valid causal interpretations of treatment effects. We will:    - Develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims and EMR databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders. The performance of these approaches will be evaluated in 6 example studies encompassing recent drug safety and comparative effectiveness problems, and will be implemented in multiple large claims databases supplemented by such data as lab values and EMR information in subgroups.    -- Develop novel methods for confounding adjustment based on textual information found in EMRs.    -- Expand the newly developed mining algorithms into a framework that integrates distributed database networks with uneven information content, similar to the Sentinel Network recently initiated by FDA.                            This project is likely to produce groundbreaking results at the interface of medicine, biomedical informatics, and epidemiologic methods. After completion of this project a library of documented and validated algorithms will be available to significantly improve confounder control in a range of healthcare databases. The theoretical foundation and the ready-to-use algorithms will likely lead to a fundamental shift in how databases contribute to the fast and accurate assessment of newly-marketed medications.            Large healthcare databases are used to assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs. However, conventional adjustment methods that rely on a limited number of investigator-specific covariates often fail to produce unbiased results. We will develop algorithms that make greater use of information contained in longitudinal claims data and electronic medical records databases by empirically identifying thousands of potential confounders.

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,7761795,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2009,447671,-0.004497677983540655
"Toward Individually-tailored Medicine: Probabilistic Models of Cerebral Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding, both from incidental discovery on imaging studies and on autopsy; it is estimated that anywhere from 1-6% of the American population will develop this problem. Unfortunately, while our ability to detect ICAs has grown, our fundamental understanding of this disease entity remains lacking and significant debate continues in regards to its treatment. Given the high degree of mortality and comorbidity associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, it is imperative that new insights and approaches be developed to inform medical decision making involving ICAs. Thus, the objective of this proposal is the creation of an informatics infrastructure to help elucidate the genesis, progression, and treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Building from our efforts from the previous R01, a set of technical developments is outlined to transform the array of information routinely collected from clinical as- sessment of ICA patients into a Bayesian belief network (BBN) that models the disease. First, we evolve the concept of a phenomenon-centric data model (PCDM) as the basis for (temporally) organizing clinically-derived observations, enabling the model to be associated with processing pipelines that can identify and transform targeted variables from the content of clinical data sources. Through these pipelines, specific values in free- text reports (radiology, surgery, pathology, discharge summaries) and imaging studies will be automatically extracted into a scientific-quality database. Second, the PCDM schema for ICAs is mapped to a Bayesian belief network: the linkage between the PCDM and BBN allows automatic updating of the network and its progressive refinement from a growing dataset. The BBN's topology will be determined by clinical experts and conditional probabilities computed from the extracted clinical data. A basic graphical user interface (GUI) will permit users to interact with the BBN, aiding in medical decision making tasks. The GUI will allow a clinician to pose questions from either a set of common clinical queries or to create new queries: loading a patient's medical record into this application will automatically populate BBN variables with extracted information (i.e., from the pipelines). Each technical component of this proposal will be evaluated in a laboratory setting. In addition, the BBN will be tested for its predictive capabilities and compared to other statistical models to assess its potential in guiding ICA treatment. This proposal leverages a clinical collaboration with the UCLA Division of Interventional Neuroradiology, a leader in ICA research and treatment. A combined dataset of 2,000 retrospective and prospective subjects will be used to create the ICA database and BBN. Data collection will encompass a comprehensive set of variables including clinical presentation, imaging assessment (morphology, hemodynamics), histopathology, gene expression, treatment, and outcomes. We will additionally leverage the NIH/NINDS Human Genetic DNA and Cell Line Repository for additional ICA-related data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies. The associated mortality rate and comorbidity resultant from ruptured ICAs are extreme: subarachnoid hemorrhage causes 50% of individuals to die within one month of rupture, and more than one third of survivors develop major neurological deficits. Hence, the focus of this re- search is the creation of a comprehensive research database for ICA patients, using the spectrum of data routinely acquired in the diagnosis and treatment of the problem; from this database, a new probabilistic model of ICAs will be created, providing new insights into the disease and its optimal treatment for a given individual.           PROGRAM NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms (ICAs) are an increasingly common finding on routine computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) neuro-imaging studies.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance.

"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7675157,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'day', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2008,354823,0.000973045645250029
"Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Linguastat, Inc. proposes to develop a means to automate the process of monitoring and identifying companies engaged in false advertising and deceptive practices in the marketing of drugs, dietary supplements, and/or food products. By leveraging state of the art approaches in computational linguistics such as Information Extraction and Natural Language Processing, it should be feasible, with some adaptation, to use this technology to: 1) automatically and continuously monitor the websites, TV transcripts, press releases and other electronic marketing text communications of tens of thousands of companies for various claims and product information 2) automatically ""red-flag"" instances in which claims have a high likelihood of potential harm to consumers, according to FDA priorities 3) automatically identify and extract the companies, products and claims embedded in electronic product information and electronic promotional materials to create a database easily searchable by the FDA and 4) automatically capture web-based or other electronic content for human review and store it as ""evidence."" Such automated technology would enable the FDA to significantly stretch its limited human resource to more effectively and comprehensively identify noncompliant product information, detect deceptive ads and other illegal practices, successfully prosecute offenders, and prevent harm to American consumers. For this Phase I SBIR project we propose to assess the feasibility of automated claims monitoring in three steps: In the first step, we will train information extraction and natural language processing algorithms to extract product marketing claims from text. In the second, step we will apply data mining and rules-based algorithms to assess which claims are likely to be non-compliant and merit further attention by FDA staff. In the third step, we will design and build a database of product claims that allows analysts to search, organize, and prioritize product claims based on the type of claim (e.g. what ailments does the product claim to treat), the type of product, and the likelihood of non- compliance. This technology will enable regulators and consumers to better monitor and detect cases of false, misleading, or deceptive advertising and product information. By enabling more effective enforcement of FDA regulations and giving consumers tools to make better buying decisions, the public health can be better protected by minimizing the impact of products that cause harm, give false hope, or entice consumers to forgo conventional remedies.          n/a",Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA,7677599,R43FD003406,[' '],FDA,"LINGUASTAT, INC.",R43,2008,20000,-0.013184858283477463
"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7502749,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Numbers', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'mecarzole', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2008,352226,-0.007112068200038941
"Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have shown that the readability of the health information provided to consumers does not match their general reading levels (Rudd, Moeykens et al. 2000). Even with the efforts of healthcare providers and writers to make materials more readable, today most patient-oriented Web sites, pamphlets, drug-labels, and discharge instructions still require the consumer to have a tenth grade reading level or higher (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer et al. 2004). Not infrequently, however, consumer reading levels are as low as fourth grade. To address this problem, we propose developing a computer-based method for providing texts of appropriate readability to a consumer. Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive impact on reader comprehension.

"Evidence based anomaly detection in clinical databases.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medical errors and their timely identification remain an important problem in clinical practice. Electronic medical record repositories and electronic data processing offer an opportunity to identify such errors in time to prevent them or at least attenuate their harm.  Typical computer-based error detection methods rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that is incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. Alerting that is based on knowledge is generally reliable; however, it is time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge, and as a consequence such systems are relatively narrow in their scope.  We propose to develop and evaluate a data-based approach for detecting clinical outliers (anomalies) that is complementary to knowledge-based approaches. This new approach is based on comparing clinical actions, such as medications given and labs ordered, taken for the current patient to those actions taken for similar patients in the recent past, as recorded in a clinical database. If a clinical action for the current patient is highly unusual, then a cautionary alert is raised along with an explanation for why the action appears to be unusual. Key advantages of the new technique are that it works with minimal prior knowledge, and it may detect anomalies for which no rules have yet been written. Thus, this data-driven approach to clinical anomaly detection is expected to complement knowledge-based alerting methods. We propose to implement a data-driven anomaly detection method, and then evaluate it in a laboratory setting using retrospective data for the cohort of surgical cardiac patients.  The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in rule-based alerting in a hospital setting, clinical pharmacy, laboratory medicine, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories.          n/a",Evidence based anomaly detection in clinical databases.,7385073,R21LM009102,"['Anticoagulants', 'Arts', 'Attenuated', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Flushing', 'General Population', 'Healthcare', 'Heparin', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources Management', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Practice Management', 'Procedures', 'Range', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prophylactic', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2008,193536,0.020356392240344783
"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Improving Public Health Grey Literature Access for the Public Health Workforce    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed project is to provide the public health (PH) workforce with improved access to high quality, relevant PH grey literature reports in order to positively impact the planning, conducting, and evaluating of PH interventions. The project will consist of two components: 1) continuation of user-focused technical system development, and 2) deployment and evaluation of this system's impact on the tasks of the PH workforce in county health departments.      The system will automatically harvest web-based grey literature reports (utilizing rules trained on input from PH professionals) and then produce rich summaries of PH grey literature reports using the model of essential elements of PH intervention reports validated by PH specialists (Turner et al, In Press). After developing a user interface that capitalizes on both natural language querying and the display of search results in a structured, model-based summary, the system will be introduced into several county health departments and evaluated to determine its impact on information flows and uses.      The project will include intrinsic evaluations of: 1) the appropriateness of the grey literature reports harvested by the system; 2) the quality and sufficiency of summaries representing the full reports based on the PH intervention model and; 3) retrieval results for users' queries using metrics of precision and recall. Extrinsic evaluation will be done in PH departments participating in the New York Academy of Medicine's ongoing study of the relationship between information and effectiveness. The research will provide baseline measures. We will evaluate: 1) the ease and frequency of use, perceptions of currency, accuracy, and completeness of retrieved reports by county PH personnel, and; 2) impact of the system's usage on information flows and uses based on internal outcome measures within the county health departments.      The work proposed here shares both the missions of public health and the National Library of Medicine   through the design of an information system that exploits natural language processing technology to   efficiently collect and provide access to quality public health grey literature for the public health workforce.         n/a",Improving Public Health Grey Literature Access for the Public Health Workforce,7414601,G08LM008983,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Basic Science', 'Collection', 'Computer Systems Development', 'County', 'Digital Libraries', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Improve Access', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Life', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metric', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome Measure', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Today', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Update', 'Wood material', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'tool']",NLM,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,G08,2008,142400,-0.0005369733098015771
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance. We will evaluate the incremental benefit of structured data, narrative data, and temporally processed narrative data.           n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,7288319,R01LM006910,"['Address', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Persons', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'satisfaction', 'syndromic surveillance']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,345833,0.003045811463893239
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7217497,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'day', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,361696,0.000973045645250029
"Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Linguastat, Inc. proposes to develop a means to automate the process of monitoring and identifying companies engaged in false advertising and deceptive practices in the marketing of drugs, dietary supplements, and/or food products. By leveraging state of the art approaches in computational linguistics such as Information Extraction and Natural Language Processing, it should be feasible, with some adaptation, to use this technology to: 1) automatically and continuously monitor the websites, TV transcripts, press releases and other electronic marketing text communications of tens of thousands of companies for various claims and product information 2) automatically ""red-flag"" instances in which claims have a high likelihood of potential harm to consumers, according to FDA priorities 3) automatically identify and extract the companies, products and claims embedded in electronic product information and electronic promotional materials to create a database easily searchable by the FDA and 4) automatically capture web-based or other electronic content for human review and store it as ""evidence."" Such automated technology would enable the FDA to significantly stretch its limited human resource to more effectively and comprehensively identify noncompliant product information, detect deceptive ads and other illegal practices, successfully prosecute offenders, and prevent harm to American consumers. For this Phase I SBIR project we propose to assess the feasibility of automated claims monitoring in three steps: In the first step, we will train information extraction and natural language processing algorithms to extract product marketing claims from text. In the second, step we will apply data mining and rules-based algorithms to assess which claims are likely to be non-compliant and merit further attention by FDA staff. In the third step, we will design and build a database of product claims that allows analysts to search, organize, and prioritize product claims based on the type of claim (e.g. what ailments does the product claim to treat), the type of product, and the likelihood of non- compliance. This technology will enable regulators and consumers to better monitor and detect cases of false, misleading, or deceptive advertising and product information. By enabling more effective enforcement of FDA regulations and giving consumers tools to make better buying decisions, the public health can be better protected by minimizing the impact of products that cause harm, give false hope, or entice consumers to forgo conventional remedies.          n/a",Using Natural Language Processing to Monitor Product Claims Compliance for FDA,7326883,R43FD003406,[' '],FDA,"LINGUASTAT, INC.",R43,2007,99773,-0.013184858283477463
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7380099,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Numbers', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'mecarzole', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2007,383550,-0.007112068200038941
"Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have shown that the readability of the health information provided to consumers does not match their general reading levels (Rudd, Moeykens et al. 2000). Even with the efforts of healthcare providers and writers to make materials more readable, today most patient-oriented Web sites, pamphlets, drug-labels, and discharge instructions still require the consumer to have a tenth grade reading level or higher (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer et al. 2004). Not infrequently, however, consumer reading levels are as low as fourth grade. To address this problem, we propose developing a computer-based method for providing texts of appropriate readability to a consumer. Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive impact on reader comprehension. We will use as a test bed for our system a general internal medicine clinic and its diabetes patients. We will provide self-care materials to these patients. Relevance to public health: The proposed development of a readability assessment instrument and ""Plain English"" tool will help translating complex health materials into reader-appropriate texts.

"The Use of Mathematic Algorithms in the Prevention of Improper Medical Payments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to create software that uses mathematical algorithms to detect medical billing coding errors prior to payment. The well-publicized failure of current healthcare cost containment technologies to prevent improper payments in both the commercial healthcare market and the federal Medicare program highlights the urgent need for a new approach to the growing problem of out of control medical costs. A recent federal study by the GAO estimated that improper payments by Medicare alone were in excess of 21 billion dollars, a truly staggering 48.1 percent of all improper payments by federal programs. Like SPAM, whose dynamic nature makes static or post hoc remedies ineffective, effective cost containment in one area often merely leads to the creation of new areas of abuse. Clearly, the ideal solution is a system that can evaluate the fairness of payments before they are made, and that can respond to dynamic patterns of abuse. The first step in creating such a system is the creation of robust method for sorting bills for appropriate rule-based analysis on the basis of the type of bill. Currently neither Medicare nor major insurers are capable of making this classification reliably except through the use of inefficient, static rules and the use of manual sorting--a costly and inefficient approach to assuring timely payment to hospitals and medical providers. We propose a novel method for using mathematical algorithms that utilize machine-learning (ML) methods to address the problem of medical bill categorization, the first step in coding error detection. Specifically, we propose the evaluation of a variety of genetic algorithms that are well adapted to the problems of large, dynamic datasets and can be ""trained"" using real world correctly coded datasets in healthcare claims. This work is particularly timely due to recent Medicare contracting reform. Using more than 50 contractors and carriers, bill classification is largely determined by the carrier's contract. Centralizing this process to only four payment centers will require the classification system we propose. [This research is directed toward the development of software applications that will detect billing errors and perform proper edits to payment of medical bills. Current anticipated changes and reforms in the Medicare system will require these systems, which do not currently exist in the public or private sector.]             n/a",The Use of Mathematic Algorithms in the Prevention of Improper Medical Payments,7316071,R43LM009190,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Contractor', 'Contracts', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Fraud', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Industry', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Private Sector', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'college', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'mathematical algorithm', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'payment', 'prevent', 'programs', 'size', 'software development', 'stem', 'success']",NLM,"QMEDTRIX SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2007,92482,0.02756171948825313
"Evidence based anomaly detection in clinical databases.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medical errors and their timely identification remain an important problem in clinical practice. Electronic medical record repositories and electronic data processing offer an opportunity to identify such errors in time to prevent them or at least attenuate their harm.  Typical computer-based error detection methods rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that is incorporated into the monitoring and alerting systems. Alerting that is based on knowledge is generally reliable; however, it is time-consuming and costly to extract and codify such knowledge, and as a consequence such systems are relatively narrow in their scope.  We propose to develop and evaluate a data-based approach for detecting clinical outliers (anomalies) that is complementary to knowledge-based approaches. This new approach is based on comparing clinical actions, such as medications given and labs ordered, taken for the current patient to those actions taken for similar patients in the recent past, as recorded in a clinical database. If a clinical action for the current patient is highly unusual, then a cautionary alert is raised along with an explanation for why the action appears to be unusual. Key advantages of the new technique are that it works with minimal prior knowledge, and it may detect anomalies for which no rules have yet been written. Thus, this data-driven approach to clinical anomaly detection is expected to complement knowledge-based alerting methods. We propose to implement a data-driven anomaly detection method, and then evaluate it in a laboratory setting using retrospective data for the cohort of surgical cardiac patients.  The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in rule-based alerting in a hospital setting, clinical pharmacy, laboratory medicine, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories.          n/a",Evidence based anomaly detection in clinical databases.,7197167,R21LM009102,"['Anticoagulants', 'Arts', 'Attenuated', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Flushing', 'General Population', 'Healthcare', 'Heparin', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources Management', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Practice Management', 'Procedures', 'Range', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prophylactic', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2007,161562,0.020356392240344783
"Automated Detection of Medical Errors DESCRIPTION:    The long-term goal of this proposal is to use the electronic medical record, including narrative text, to understand and encode the process of care for individual patients in order to improve patient safety.   Achieving this goal has the potential to help detect adverse events, and to differentiate medical errors from appropriately tailored care. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows: 1) To understand and encode the process of care for individual patients using data in the electronic medical record, including narrative text.   2) To use a more detailed understanding of patients' processes of care to improve automated adverse event detection. 3) To match processes of care for individual patients against accepted care pathways in order to identify discrepancies. We will capitalize on three core technologies that are in active use by clinicians and researchers in our busy clinical setting: 1) a Web-based clinical information system and its associated clinical data repository (WebCIS), 2) a full medical language parser (MedLEE), and 3) a semi-structured, electronic physician documentation system built by the applicant specifically to support this project (eNote).   Methods will include evaluating the performance (sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value) of our system, DETER+MINE (DETecting ERrors Mining Narrative Electronically), to model the care process and detect adverse events and pathway deviations. We will utilize explicit process criteria and manual, retrospective chart review as a gold standard.   This research is intended to provide proof of concept that combining natural language processing of clinical narrative with traditional sources of coded data is required for effective screening with automated defection systems. This approach has the potential to impact significantly on our ability to detect and investigate medical errors, adverse medical events, and pathway deviations by reducing reliance on costly and slow manual chart reviews. n/a",Automated Detection of Medical Errors,7282343,K22LM008805,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Applications Grants', 'Caring', 'Causations', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Language', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Negligence', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Range', 'Recommendation', 'Reliance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source Code', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States', 'base', 'computerized', 'concept', 'experience', 'improved', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K22,2007,135000,0.034886586567499246

The project will develop tools and algorithms to detect the patient symptoms, physical exam signs, test results, and medical diagnoses that may indicate drug-induced injury. n/a",TIME:(Tools for Inpatient Monitoring using Evidence)for Safe & AppropriateTesting,7347232,R01LM007995,"['Abnormal Laboratory Test Result', 'Accreditation', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Admission activity', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Appendix', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Chest Pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Condition', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Diuretics', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Utilization', 'Drug toxicity', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Glucose Intolerance', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hormones', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hydralazine', 'Image', 'Inappropriate ADH Syndrome', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Lower Extremity', 'Lupus', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Methotrexate', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myopathy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Physical Examination', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procainamide', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Purpose', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rofecoxib', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Toxic effect', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'base', 'care systems', 'concept', 'healthy volunteer', 'impression', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'post-market', 'programs', 'telithromycin', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MED CTR,R01,2007,55295,-0.007555940024712103
"Improving Public Health Grey Literature Access for the Public Health Workforce    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed project is to provide the public health (PH) workforce with improved access to high quality, relevant PH grey literature reports in order to positively impact the planning, conducting, and evaluating of PH interventions. The project will consist of two components: 1) continuation of user-focused technical system development, and 2) deployment and evaluation of this system's impact on the tasks of the PH workforce in county health departments.      The system will automatically harvest web-based grey literature reports (utilizing rules trained on input from PH professionals) and then produce rich summaries of PH grey literature reports using the model of essential elements of PH intervention reports validated by PH specialists (Turner et al, In Press). After developing a user interface that capitalizes on both natural language querying and the display of search results in a structured, model-based summary, the system will be introduced into several county health departments and evaluated to determine its impact on information flows and uses.      The project will include intrinsic evaluations of: 1) the appropriateness of the grey literature reports harvested by the system; 2) the quality and sufficiency of summaries representing the full reports based on the PH intervention model and; 3) retrieval results for users' queries using metrics of precision and recall.

"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,7249382,R01EB000362,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Geographic Locations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Information Management', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Link', 'Management Information Systems', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Metric', 'Multimedia', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Series', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'United States', 'Urology', 'Visit', 'base', 'concept', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'peer', 'point of care', 'portability', 'research clinical testing', 'urologic', 'usability']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2007,517331,0.02514263511684836
"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,7272822,R01EB002247,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Body of uterus', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Condition', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Oncologist', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Slice', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teleconsultations', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Upper arm', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'health care quality', 'image registration', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'size', 'telehealth']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2007,394864,-0.0029329304846929154
"Biosurveillance Utilizing SNOMED-CT Based Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%. This proposal deals with practical issues that lead the way toward interoperable data. The fruits of this research will assist our national initiatives to pave the way toward a safe and effective BioSecure biosurveillance solution. n/a",Biosurveillance Utilizing SNOMED-CT Based Natural Language Processing,7790142,R01PH000022,[' '],PHPPO,MOUNT SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2007,677278,0.003937082531126541
"Natural Language Processing for Respiratory Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator in biomedical informatics research. She will dedicate her career to developing and evaluating methodologies for improving the processes and outcomes of healthcare using data locked in textual documents. This career development award will provide her with initial support for achieving her career goals.      The applicant has three goals for her career development over the next three years. First, she will compare the performance of different machine learning techniques at detecting patients with a respiratory syndrome. The proposed research will expand the state-of-the-art syndromic surveillance capabilities by integrating findings, symptoms, and diseases described in textual medical records. The product of the first research goal will be a model for respiratory syndromic case detection for monitoring natural and bioterrorism induced respiratory outbreaks. Second, she will apply existing methods and develop new techniques for extracting clinical conditions required for respiratory case detection from emergency department notes, contributing new knowledge to the medical language processing field using sentence and report level models that account for uncertainty, negation, and temporal occurrence. The product of the second goal will be a better understanding of the information required for accurate detection of respiratory related conditions from text and useful tools for automatically extracting that information. Third, she will teach, promote, and facilitate the use of natural language processing in the biomedical informatics field. The product of the third goal will be a graduate class surveying medical language processing methodology and applications and development of general tools sets for researchers who need encoded data from textual patient records.        The proposed research will focus on:   Aim 1. Development and evaluation of a respiratory case detection model;   Aim 2. Integration of existing natural language processing tools and development of new methodologies for extracting clinical conditions needed for respiratory case detection from textual records; and   Aim 3.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ongoing goal of our project, ""Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,"" is to develop and apply methods to exploit electronic medical record data for decision support, with an emphasis on narrative data. Since the inception of our project as an R29 in 1994, we have been developing methods for preparing raw electronic medical record data, applying and evaluating natural language processing, developing data mining techniques including machine learning, and putting the results to use for clinical care and research.       In this competing continuation, we propose to address the temporal information in the electronic medical record and to apply natural language processing and temporal processing to the task of syndromic surveillance in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).       We have begun work on a temporal processing system. It extracts temporal assertions stated in narrative reports, uses the MedLEE natural language processor to parse the non-temporal information, infers implicit temporal assertions based on a knowledge base, and produces the information in the form of a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem. The latter can be used to answer questions about the time of events and the temporal relation between pairs of events. We propose to complete the system, expand the knowledge base, speed computation, address the uncertainty of temporal assertions, incorporate temporal information from structured data, and evaluate the system.       NYC DOHMH has a mature syndromic surveillance system that watches over almost eight million persons, and it has as-yet unexploited data sources in the form of narrative and structured electronic medical records. We propose to apply natural language processing and our proposed temporal processing to convert the data to a form appropriate for surveillance. We will evaluate the incremental benefit of structured data, narrative data, and temporally processed narrative data.           n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,7147611,R01LM006910,"['artificial intelligence', 'classification', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'health care facility information system', 'human data', 'information system analysis', 'method development', 'vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,372106,0.003045811463893239
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7101997,R01LM008799,"['clinical research', 'human', 'language', 'memory disorders', 'model', 'physicians', 'training', 'voice']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,372499,0.000973045645250029
"Automated Detection of Medical Errors DESCRIPTION:    The long-term goal of this proposal is to use the electronic medical record, including narrative text, to understand and encode the process of care for individual patients in order to improve patient safety.   Achieving this goal has the potential to help detect adverse events, and to differentiate medical errors from appropriately tailored care. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows: 1) To understand and encode the process of care for individual patients using data in the electronic medical record, including narrative text.   2) To use a more detailed understanding of patients' processes of care to improve automated adverse event detection. 3) To match processes of care for individual patients against accepted care pathways in order to identify discrepancies. We will capitalize on three core technologies that are in active use by clinicians and researchers in our busy clinical setting: 1) a Web-based clinical information system and its associated clinical data repository (WebCIS), 2) a full medical language parser (MedLEE), and 3) a semi-structured, electronic physician documentation system built by the applicant specifically to support this project (eNote).   Methods will include evaluating the performance (sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value) of our system, DETER+MINE (DETecting ERrors Mining Narrative Electronically), to model the care process and detect adverse events and pathway deviations. We will utilize explicit process criteria and manual, retrospective chart review as a gold standard.   This research is intended to provide proof of concept that combining natural language processing of clinical narrative with traditional sources of coded data is required for effective screening with automated defection systems. This approach has the potential to impact significantly on our ability to detect and investigate medical errors, adverse medical events, and pathway deviations by reducing reliance on costly and slow manual chart reviews. n/a",Automated Detection of Medical Errors,7124706,K22LM008805,"['automated medical record system', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'health care quality', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'information retrieval', 'medical records', 'method development', 'patient care management', 'patient safety /medical error']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K22,2006,135000,0.034886586567499246

"Biosurveillance/SNOMED-CT Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%. This proposal deals with practical issues that lead the way toward interoperable data. The fruits of this research will assist our national initiatives to pave the way toward a safe and effective BioSecure biosurveillance solution.  n/a",Biosurveillance/SNOMED-CT Natural Language Processing,7098649,R01PH000022,"['abstracting', 'artificial intelligence', 'biohazard detection', 'bioterrorism /chemical warfare', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'disease outbreaks', 'early diagnosis', 'environmental health', 'human data', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'model design /development', 'public health', 'rapid diagnosis', 'vocabulary development for information system']",PHPPO,MAYO CLINIC,R01,2005,514616,0.003994930317925686
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     With the advent of improved clinical information system products (e.g., ambulatory systems, order entry  systems), improved data entry technologies (e.g., speech recognition, text processing techniques), and  further adoption of data interchange standards, more institutions are generating electronic medical records, and these records will expand in breadth, depth, and degree of coding in the future. The records are used mainly for individual patient care, but exploiting the records for clinical research and quality functions has lagged behind. Major challenges include the wide range of complex data and missing and inaccurate data.      We propose to continue our work to develop and test methods to mine a clinical data repository. A  special emphasis will be to exploit the vast amount of information in the repository (latent associations and knowledge) and to use computer intensive techniques and advances in data representation and manipulation to better interpret what is in the database and to overcome the challenges of complex, missing, and inaccurate data. We hypothesize that data mining techniques can be applied to a repository to generate accurate clinical interpretations. We further hypothesize that associations latent in a clinically rich repository can be used to improve the classification of cases in that repository.      We aim to develop methods to prepare data for mining; to characterize the information in the clinical data repository; to develop similarity measures based on manipulation of natural language processor output and on information retrieval techniques; to apply nearest neighbor technique and case-based reasoning to improve classification; to develop a statistically based method to improve classification of cases with incomplete or inaccurate data; and to apply our methods to real clinical research questions and carry out additional data mining research.      The researchers in the Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia University are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (data mining, statistics, health data organization, health knowledge representation, natural language processing), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data. n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,6892934,R01LM006910,"['artificial intelligence', 'classification', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'health care facility information system', 'human data', 'information system analysis', 'method development', 'vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,384538,-0.0007565019972751614
"Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Data Sources DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Electronic medical record systems (EMR) contain a wealth of clinical data that is invaluable for biomedical research, but because there are no satisfactory methods to build coherent specialized knowledge bases, which represent the information in free text medical records, data mining and clinical discovery are held back. Medical Reporting Solutions, Inc. has developed advanced technology, which we propose to extend, refine, and test for constructing specialized semantic knowledge bases. These knowledge bases will encode the clinical information in medical reports, and enable automated natural language processing systems for extracting clinical knowledge.      Our research and development uses methods in corpus linguistics and sentential logic to represent the knowledge in free-text medical reports in an efficient, codeable manner. We have created tools to map sentences in a medical domain to unique codeable propositions. Our method for creating knowledge ontologies makes it easy for biomedical researchers to get semantic information at the appropriate level of detail. The knowledge base and mapping tables allow us to analyze medical reports in near real-time. One knowledge base, under development, is derived from hundreds of thousands of reports in the radiology domain, and we intend to analyze other medical domains using the methods we have pioneered.      Our phase one project plan includes further improving our knowledge editing tools, substantially enlarging our semantic knowledge base to cover over 60-70% of the radiology domain, and extensively test our knowledge representation schema against actual radiology reports. We plan to make the knowledge base freely accessible to the biomedical research community, while providing commercial services to codify free text reports found in EMRs. n/a",Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Data Sources,6988908,R43LM008974,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information retrieval']",NLM,"LOGICAL SEMANTICS, INC.",R43,2005,100000,-0.010887888160050025
"Automated Detection of Medical Errors DESCRIPTION:    The long-term goal of this proposal is to use the electronic medical record, including narrative text, to understand and encode the process of care for individual patients in order to improve patient safety.   Achieving this goal has the potential to help detect adverse events, and to differentiate medical errors from appropriately tailored care. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows: 1) To understand and encode the process of care for individual patients using data in the electronic medical record, including narrative text.   2) To use a more detailed understanding of patients' processes of care to improve automated adverse event detection. 3) To match processes of care for individual patients against accepted care pathways in order to identify discrepancies. We will capitalize on three core technologies that are in active use by clinicians and researchers in our busy clinical setting: 1) a Web-based clinical information system and its associated clinical data repository (WebCIS), 2) a full medical language parser (MedLEE), and 3) a semi-structured, electronic physician documentation system built by the applicant specifically to support this project (eNote).   Methods will include evaluating the performance (sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value) of our system, DETER+MINE (DETecting ERrors Mining Narrative Electronically), to model the care process and detect adverse events and pathway deviations. We will utilize explicit process criteria and manual, retrospective chart review as a gold standard.   This research is intended to provide proof of concept that combining natural language processing of clinical narrative with traditional sources of coded data is required for effective screening with automated defection systems. This approach has the potential to impact significantly on our ability to detect and investigate medical errors, adverse medical events, and pathway deviations by reducing reliance on costly and slow manual chart reviews. n/a",Automated Detection of Medical Errors,6958394,K22LM008805,"['automated medical record system', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'health care quality', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'information retrieval', 'medical records', 'method development', 'patient care management', 'patient safety /medical error']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K22,2005,134800,0.034886586567499246
"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,6948251,R01EB002247,"['anatomy', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer data analysis', 'computer graphics /printing', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'health care quality', 'health care referral /consultation', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'musculoskeletal disorder', 'nervous system disorder', 'statistics /biometry', 'telemedicine']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2005,399327,-0.0029329304846929154
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center.

"Natural Language Processing for Respiratory Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator in biomedical informatics research. She will dedicate her career to developing and evaluating methodologies for improving the processes and outcomes of healthcare using data locked in textual documents. This career development award will provide her with initial support for achieving her career goals.      The applicant has three goals for her career development over the next three years. First, she will compare the performance of different machine learning techniques at detecting patients with a respiratory syndrome. The proposed research will expand the state-of-the-art syndromic surveillance capabilities by integrating findings, symptoms, and diseases described in textual medical records.

"Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets Privacy is a fundamental right and needs to be protected.  For health care related d information, there are regulations for disclosure.  These regulations were motivated by the public's concern of breaches of confidentiality that might result in discrimination.  The recent progress in electronic medical record technology, the Internet, and the genetic revolution, together with media reports on violations of privacy have generated increasing interest in this topic.  A common belief is that sensitive information is more easily available with the use of networked computers. Since total lack of disclosure is not realistic, current regulations require that the ""minimal amount"" of information be given to a certain party.  A thorough study on what constitutes ""minimal"" for particular types of applications and a ""usefulness index"" is lacking.  An exact quantification of the potential for privacy breach in de-identified or anonymized databases is also lacking.  Definition and quantification of these indices is important for decision-making.  As we demonstrate, de-identified data sets can still be used for inference and therefore may disclose sensitive information.  The use of machine learning methods to verify the remaining functional dependencies in a de- identified data set leads to better understanding of the possible inferences.  Anonymization techniques based on logic, statistics, database theory, and machine learning methods can help in the protection of privacy. We will formally define and study anonymity in databases, from a theoretical and a practical standpoint.  We will develop and implement algorithms to anonymize data sets that will be in accordance with the balance of anonymity and ""usefulness"" of the disclosed data sets.  We will also develop and implement algorithms to verify the anonymity of a given data set and indicate the type of records that are at highest risk for a privacy attack.

"Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Narrative information is vital to health care, because it enables physicians to synthesize the raw facts and provide a context and interpretation for them.  Electronic medical record systems contain a wealth of clinical data, but typically lack the clinical narrative found in paper records, e.g., the patient history and progress notes.  Numerous barriers prevent the timely acquisition of narrative data, and most computer systems are unable to use such information productively.  Current approaches offer a tradeoff, capture of rich clinical data that lacks structure (using transcription services or speech technology), versus entry of structured data that lacks flexibility and expressiveness (using template systems).  Natural language processing can integrate these approaches by allowing physicians full freedom of expression while producing structured documents that preserve the richness and enable further computer processing.   This proposal seeks to capture and structure narrative in the online medical record in order to improve entry time, completeness, information content and consistency of clinical documentation.  The specific aims of this proposal are:  1) Maintain the continuity of the medical record; a lengthy medical record requires significant time to review and digest.  Many facts from past narratives remain true in the present or persist with minor changes.  By automatically bringing these facts forward into the current narrative, the system can reduce the time to enter the document, and improve the completeness of documentation by maintaining continuity of what is known about a patient; 2) Integrate the medical record:  Electronic medical records contain a vast amount of data.  However, most of these data are raw facts.  By helping the physician to connect, interpret and summarize these facts, the system can improve the usefulness of the information in the record, and reduce the time to enter documents by performing some syntheses automatically; and 3) Harmonize the medical record; the multidisciplinary nature of health care creates the potential for the differing perspectives and interpretations in the medical record, and even contradictions.  By bringing possible discrepancies to the attention of the physician, the system can help resolve the inconsistencies.     n/a",Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record,6802698,R01LM007268,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'information systems', 'medical records', 'online computer', 'primary care physician', 'vocabulary']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,437194,0.050825260056767296

"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3). Scenario-based proxies provide up-to-date access to relevant medical information. Relaxation broadens queries to medical information when exact matches are not found. Software toolkits and user models enable user-, and domain-, and task-specific customizations. The hardware independent architecture will facilitate access to the system across different platforms and software subsystems. Together, they form a unique infrastructure that provides broad and intelligently customized access to well-defined structured data and up-to-date literature. This, in addition to patient-specific relevant data, expert opinion, and similar cases with known outcome, will promote the evidence-based practice of medicine.

Although a formal cost-effectiveness study is not proposed, the foundation is laid for these measurements when these PACs technologies mature. These measurements will be facilitated by recording resource utilization, determining of imaging-based episodes of care, and counter- specific information related to a chief complaint.  n/a",PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE,6717704,P01EB000216,"['automated medical record system', 'health care facility information system', 'radiology', 'telemedicine']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P01,2004,1723576,0.014711785771748531

The               proliferation of online information and the diversity of interfaces to data          collections has led to a medical information gap between medical researchers         and the accessibility of medical literature databases.  Users who need access        to such information must visit a variety of sources, which can be both               excessively time consuming and potentially dangerous if the information is           needed for treatment decisions.  In addition, information generated by using         existing search engines is often too general or inaccurate.  Particularly            frustrating is that simple queries can result in an excessive number of              documents retrieved - too many to search through to determine which are and          which are not relevant.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     With the advent of improved clinical information system products (e.g., ambulatory systems, order entry  systems), improved data entry technologies (e.g., speech recognition, text processing techniques), and  further adoption of data interchange standards, more institutions are generating electronic medical records, and these records will expand in breadth, depth, and degree of coding in the future. The records are used mainly for individual patient care, but exploiting the records for clinical research and quality functions has lagged behind. Major challenges include the wide range of complex data and missing and inaccurate data.      We propose to continue our work to develop and test methods to mine a clinical data repository. A  special emphasis will be to exploit the vast amount of information in the repository (latent associations and knowledge) and to use computer intensive techniques and advances in data representation and manipulation to better interpret what is in the database and to overcome the challenges of complex, missing, and inaccurate data. We hypothesize that data mining techniques can be applied to a repository to generate accurate clinical interpretations. We further hypothesize that associations latent in a clinically rich repository can be used to improve the classification of cases in that repository.      We aim to develop methods to prepare data for mining; to characterize the information in the clinical data repository; to develop similarity measures based on manipulation of natural language processor output and on information retrieval techniques; to apply nearest neighbor technique and case-based reasoning to improve classification; to develop a statistically based method to improve classification of cases with incomplete or inaccurate data; and to apply our methods to real clinical research questions and carry out additional data mining research.      The researchers in the Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia University are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (data mining, statistics, health data organization, health knowledge representation, natural language processing), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data. n/a",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,6630735,R01LM006910,"['artificial intelligence', ' classification', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information system analysis', ' method development', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,377617,-0.0007565019972751614
"Mining Complex Clinical Data for Patient Safety Research Medical errors hurt patients, cost money, and undermine the health care system. The first step to reducing errors is detecting them, for what cannot be detected cannot be managed. A number of approaches have been applied to medical error detection, including mandatory event reporting, voluntary near-miss reporting, chart review, and automated surveillance using information systems. Automated surveillance promises large-scale detection, minimal labor, and, potentially, detection in real time to prevent or recover from errors. Unfortunately, large amounts of important clinical information lie locked in narrative reports, unavailable to automated decision support systems. A number of tools have emerged from medical informatics and computer science- natural language processing, visualization tools, and machine learning- as well as methods for understanding cognitive processes. We hypothesize that the electronic medical record contains information useful for detecting errors and that natural language processing and other tools will allow us to retrieve the information. We will assemble a team skilled in natural language processing, data mining, terminology, patient safety research, and health care. We will use a clinical repository with ten years of data on two million patients. It includes administrative, laboratory, and pharmacy coded information as well as a wide range of narrative reports including discharge summaries, operative reports, outpatient notes, autopsy reports, resident signout notes, nursing notes, and reports from numerous ancillary services (radiology, pathology, etc.). We will apply a proven natural language processor called MedLEE to code the information and measure the accuracy of automated queries to detect and characterize errors. We will target several areas: explicit error reporting in the medical record, NYPORTS mandatory event reporting, clinical conflicts in record, and other sources of error information. We will use a systems approach to errors and cognitive analysis to uncover cues to improve error detection. We will incorporate the system into the hospital's current event surveillance program and assess the impact on error detection. We will adhere to strict privacy policies and security procedures. This project represents a unique opportunity to apply the most advanced medical language processing system to a large, comprehensive clinical repository to advance patient safety research.  n/a",Mining Complex Clinical Data for Patient Safety Research,6657426,R18HS011806,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' health service demonstration project', ' human data', ' iatrogenic disease', ' patient care', ' patient safety /medical error']",AHRQ,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R18,2003,369494,0.02345060668424049
"INTELLIGENT CRITIQUING OF CLINICAL-GUIDELINE APPLICATION Clinical guidelines are a powerful method for standardization and uniform improvement of the quality of medical care.  In the proposed research project, which we call Asgaard/DeGel, we will design and implement software solutions that support the design, application, and, in particular, quality assessment of the application of clinical guidelines by care providers.  Our long-term objectives include provision of a standardized computational framework for specification, application, and runtime as well as retrospective quality assessment of clinical-guidelines. We will provide these solutions by using a novel framework for specification and interpretation of clinical guidelines.  The new framework encodes explicitly both the therapeutic actions indicated by the guideline and the intermediate clinical process and outcome goals of the guideline designers, which we refer to as intentions.  Intentions are represented as temporal patterns of care-provider actions or patient states to be maintained, achieved or avoided, using results from our previous work on interpretation and summarization of time-oriented clinical data.  Intentions include both the intermediate and overall process pattern (care provider actions) to follow and the expected intermediate and final outcome pattern (patient states). The tasks that we are focusing on include (1) design-time tasks, such as specification, validation, and verification of the guideline, and (2) runtime tasks such as automated support to application of the guideline, recognition of care providers' intentions from their actions, and real-time as well as retrospective critiquing and quality assessment of care providers' application of he guideline, given the guideline and its intentions, the patient's medical record, and the analysis of the care provider's perceived intentions. In our previous work, we have designed a formal, machine-interpretable language, called Asbru, to represent and to annotate guidelines based on our framework, and implemented a small prototype interpreter for it.  We will implement a full interpreter for the Asbru language and a set of software tools for specification, validation, and verification of Asbru guidelines.  We will also design and implement a set of computational methods for runtime (during application) and retrospective quality assessment of clinical guideline application, both for individual patients and for populations of patients, using our intention-based model. We will rigorously test, validate, and evaluate our methodologies using collaborators in clinical areas such as oncology, hypertension, and endocrinology.    n/a",INTELLIGENT CRITIQUING OF CLINICAL-GUIDELINE APPLICATION,6637556,R01LM006806,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' experimental designs', ' health care quality', ' health services research tag', ' human data', ' medical records', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2003,279167,0.014217349878755621
"Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets Privacy is a fundamental right and needs to be protected.  For health care related d information, there are regulations for disclosure.  These regulations were motivated by the public's concern of breaches of confidentiality that might result in discrimination.  The recent progress in electronic medical record technology, the Internet, and the genetic revolution, together with media reports on violations of privacy have generated increasing interest in this topic.  A common belief is that sensitive information is more easily available with the use of networked computers. Since total lack of disclosure is not realistic, current regulations require that the ""minimal amount"" of information be given to a certain party.  A thorough study on what constitutes ""minimal"" for particular types of applications and a ""usefulness index"" is lacking.  An exact quantification of the potential for privacy breach in de-identified or anonymized databases is also lacking.  Definition and quantification of these indices is important for decision-making.  As we demonstrate, de-identified data sets can still be used for inference and therefore may disclose sensitive information.  The use of machine learning methods to verify the remaining functional dependencies in a de- identified data set leads to better understanding of the possible inferences.  Anonymization techniques based on logic, statistics, database theory, and machine learning methods can help in the protection of privacy. We will formally define and study anonymity in databases, from a theoretical and a practical standpoint.  We will develop and implement algorithms to anonymize data sets that will be in accordance with the balance of anonymity and ""usefulness"" of the disclosed data sets.  We will also develop and implement algorithms to verify the anonymity of a given data set and indicate the type of records that are at highest risk for a privacy attack.

"Novel Methods for Automated Key Image Selection    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Significant new knowledge about human behavior and the brain has come to light in recent years, due in part to rapid technical developments in imaging. As the role of imaging becomes increasingly important in neurosciences, effective methods for managing and retrieving images will become even more critical; without such advances, further progress will be hindered. The goal of this proposal is the automated summarization of large imaging sets. Image summarization proffers a method to compress imaging studies by selecting only pertinent image slices that objectively document a patient's condition; as such, its applications include multimedia electronic medical records, telemedicine, and teaching files. In Phase I, development is focused on a customizable brain atlas used for registering patient imaging studies in order to select key images. This phase addresses selection of images from ""normal"" studies and studies with only subtle morphological changes, as typical of most patients with psychiatric disorders. Automatic techniques for customizing the atlas to imaging study acquisition parameters are developed, in addition to registration methods for mapping the atlas to the patient's original study. Building from this initial work, Phase II expands to encompass selection of images from ""abnormal"" studies that exhibit gross morphological changes through principle component analysis, further customization of the atlas for different age groups (e.g., pediatric), and incorporation of structured data entry (SDE) and natural language processing (NLP) of medical reports to help guide automatic selection of key images. The resultant product will be a fully automated software system that can select relevant images from any imaging study. Initial evaluation in Phase I will examine the performance of the contrast customizable atlas and summarization/relevant slice selection, as compared to human experts.         n/a",Novel Methods for Automated Key Image Selection,6583176,R43MH065764,"['archives', ' biomedical automation', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' human data', ' image processing', ' method development']",NIMH,MEDAXIS CORPORATION,R43,2003,93365,-0.012269784353850718
"Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Narrative information is vital to health care, because it enables physicians to synthesize the raw facts and provide a context and interpretation for them.  Electronic medical record systems contain a wealth of clinical data, but typically lack the clinical narrative found in paper records, e.g., the patient history and progress notes.  Numerous barriers prevent the timely acquisition of narrative data, and most computer systems are unable to use such information productively.  Current approaches offer a tradeoff, capture of rich clinical data that lacks structure (using transcription services or speech technology), versus entry of structured data that lacks flexibility and expressiveness (using template systems).  Natural language processing can integrate these approaches by allowing physicians full freedom of expression while producing structured documents that preserve the richness and enable further computer processing.   This proposal seeks to capture and structure narrative in the online medical record in order to improve entry time, completeness, information content and consistency of clinical documentation.  The specific aims of this proposal are:  1) Maintain the continuity of the medical record; a lengthy medical record requires significant time to review and digest.  Many facts from past narratives remain true in the present or persist with minor changes.  By automatically bringing these facts forward into the current narrative, the system can reduce the time to enter the document, and improve the completeness of documentation by maintaining continuity of what is known about a patient; 2) Integrate the medical record:  Electronic medical records contain a vast amount of data.  However, most of these data are raw facts.  By helping the physician to connect, interpret and summarize these facts, the system can improve the usefulness of the information in the record, and reduce the time to enter documents by performing some syntheses automatically; and 3) Harmonize the medical record; the multidisciplinary nature of health care creates the potential for the differing perspectives and interpretations in the medical record, and even contradictions.  By bringing possible discrepancies to the attention of the physician, the system can help resolve the inconsistencies.     n/a",Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record,6665504,R01LM007268,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' information systems', ' medical records', ' online computer', ' primary care physician', ' vocabulary']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,424735,0.050825260056767296
"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,6725819,R01EB002247,"['anatomy', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer data analysis', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' health care quality', ' health care referral /consultation', ' human data', ' image enhancement', ' image processing', ' magnetic resonance imaging', ' musculoskeletal disorder', ' nervous system disorder', ' statistics /biometry', ' telemedicine']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2003,383268,-0.0029329304846929154
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6678913,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' informatics', ' information display', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' medical records', ' outcomes research', ' patient care management', ' performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2003,572597,0.02514263511684836
"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3). Scenario-based proxies provide up-to-date access to relevant medical information. Relaxation broadens queries to medical information when exact matches are not found.

"DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES A real-time clinical repository contains a wealth of detailed information useful for clinical care, research, and administration.  In their raw form, however, the data are difficult to use there is too much volume, too much detail, missing values, and inaccuracies. Clinicians, researchers, and administrators require higher level interpretations that address their questions. For example, a clinician may need to know whether a patient is at sufficient risk for having active tuberculosis to warrant respiratory isolation. The answer to the question may be spread around the clinical repository in chest radiographs, laboratory tests, medication histories, vital signs, and physician's notes. Translating from these raw data to the interpretation (at risk or not) is a difficult and laborious task. The hypothesis of this proposal is that data mining techniques can be applied to a real-time clinical repository to discover knowledge and generate accurate clinical interpretations, and that these interpretations can be automated. The project differs from earlier machine learning studies in its emphasis on a real clinical repository and the use of natural language processing to supply coded clinical data. The specific aims are: (l) Select clinical domains--Several clinical domains with interesting, non-trivial clinical problems will be selected. Problems for which a gold standard answer can or has been assembled for a retrospective cohort will be chosen. (2) Prepare raw clinical data for mining--The raw data from a clinical repository will be transformed into a structure that facilitates data mining. The data will be flattened, pivoted, summarized, and mapped as needed for the domains. Narrative data will be coded using the MedLEE natural language processor. The preparation process will be automated. (3) Use data mining algorithms to discover knowledge- Several data mining algorithms will be applied to the selected clinical domains. Algorithms will include decision tree generation, rule discovery, neural networks, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and composite algorithms (for variable reduction). The algorithms will be trained on a training set for each domain, and their predictive accuracy will be measured and compared to each other and to expert-written rules. The performance of human experts writing rules using manual data mining visualization techniques (which does not require an explicit training set) will also be measured. (4) Study the dependence of data mining on the training set--The performance of data mining algorithms depends on the data used the train them. The sensitivity of the algorithms to noise (inaccurate data), missing data, and training set size will be measured. (5) Use the discovered knowledge to generate real-time interpretations-- The output of the algorithms (decision tree, rules, neural network equation, or logistic regression equation, but not nearest neighbor) along with the necessary data preparation steps will be encoded in Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules. They will be run against the clinical repository to verify that the interpretation can be automated in real time. (6) Disseminate the methods and results--The methods and results will be disseminated via publications and a Web site, and tools will be made available.  n/a",DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES,6538211,R01LM006910,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information dissemination', ' information system analysis', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2002,403006,0.006231933670207616

Particularly            frustrating is that simple queries can result in an excessive number of              documents retrieved - too many to search through to determine which are and          which are not relevant.

"INFORMATICS TOOLS & MEDICAL PERINATAL KNOWLEDGE BUILDING DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  This proposed study will         replicate and extend methodology used in earlier studies and will use            extensive clinical data repositories, informatics tools, and expert              practitioners for perinatal medical knowledge building.                                                                                                           Clinical Data Repository:  Duke University's Medical Center (DUMC) TMR (The      Medical Record) data repository will be used for this study, and contains        45,922 electronic medical records for both low and high-risk pregnant women      (and their infants) who have received prenatal care at DUMC, and its             affiliated regional clinics, between 1/1/86 and 12/3l/95.  Each patient's        electronic data is used for clinical patient care and contains a potential       4000 variables per record.  This volume of data requires new approaches for      data analysis and medical decision support, since human information              processing limitations become quickly overloaded by both an individual           patient s data and the aggregate information collected for the perinatal         patient population.                                                                                                                                               lnformatics Tools:  Informatics techniques for knowledge acquisition and         data mining will use machine learning programs, statistical analysis, and        domain expert input to articulate relationships between the data and             perinatal patent outcomes.  The goal is to provide decision support for          perinatal care providers to accurately identify patients at risk and assist      them with modifiable preterm birth ask factors.  An expert system will use       data-generated and verified knowledge bases to test its predictive validity      when new patient cases are induced to the expert system.  Earlier studies        found 53-90% predictive accuracies for an expert system prototype, as            compared to 17-38% accuracies, reported in the literature, using current         manual techniques.  Mapping the expert system's knowledge base terms to          medical library resources will be explored for additional decision support.

"Mining Complex Clinical Data for Patient Safety Research Medical errors hurt patients, cost money, and undermine the health care system. The first step to reducing errors is detecting them, for what cannot be detected cannot be managed. A number of approaches have been applied to medical error detection, including mandatory event reporting, voluntary near-miss reporting, chart review, and automated surveillance using information systems. Automated surveillance promises large-scale detection, minimal labor, and, potentially, detection in real time to prevent or recover from errors. Unfortunately, large amounts of important clinical information lie locked in narrative reports, unavailable to automated decision support systems. A number of tools have emerged from medical informatics and computer science- natural language processing, visualization tools, and machine learning- as well as methods for understanding cognitive processes. We hypothesize that the electronic medical record contains information useful for detecting errors and that natural language processing and other tools will allow us to retrieve the information. We will assemble a team skilled in natural language processing, data mining, terminology, patient safety research, and health care. We will use a clinical repository with ten years of data on two million patients. It includes administrative, laboratory, and pharmacy coded information as well as a wide range of narrative reports including discharge summaries, operative reports, outpatient notes, autopsy reports, resident signout notes, nursing notes, and reports from numerous ancillary services (radiology, pathology, etc.). We will apply a proven natural language processor called MedLEE to code the information and measure the accuracy of automated queries to detect and characterize errors. We will target several areas: explicit error reporting in the medical record, NYPORTS mandatory event reporting, clinical conflicts in record, and other sources of error information. We will use a systems approach to errors and cognitive analysis to uncover cues to improve error detection. We will incorporate the system into the hospital's current event surveillance program and assess the impact on error detection. We will adhere to strict privacy policies and security procedures. This project represents a unique opportunity to apply the most advanced medical language processing system to a large, comprehensive clinical repository to advance patient safety research.  n/a",Mining Complex Clinical Data for Patient Safety Research,6528316,R18HS011806,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' health service demonstration project', ' human data', ' iatrogenic disease', ' patient care', ' patient safety /medical error']",AHRQ,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R18,2002,360015,0.02345060668424049
"INTELLIGENT CRITIQUING OF CLINICAL-GUIDELINE APPLICATION Clinical guidelines are a powerful method for standardization and uniform improvement of the quality of medical care.  In the proposed research project, which we call Asgaard/DeGel, we will design and implement software solutions that support the design, application, and, in particular, quality assessment of the application of clinical guidelines by care providers.  Our long-term objectives include provision of a standardized computational framework for specification, application, and runtime as well as retrospective quality assessment of clinical-guidelines. We will provide these solutions by using a novel framework for specification and interpretation of clinical guidelines.  The new framework encodes explicitly both the therapeutic actions indicated by the guideline and the intermediate clinical process and outcome goals of the guideline designers, which we refer to as intentions.  Intentions are represented as temporal patterns of care-provider actions or patient states to be maintained, achieved or avoided, using results from our previous work on interpretation and summarization of time-oriented clinical data.  Intentions include both the intermediate and overall process pattern (care provider actions) to follow and the expected intermediate and final outcome pattern (patient states). The tasks that we are focusing on include (1) design-time tasks, such as specification, validation, and verification of the guideline, and (2) runtime tasks such as automated support to application of the guideline, recognition of care providers' intentions from their actions, and real-time as well as retrospective critiquing and quality assessment of care providers' application of he guideline, given the guideline and its intentions, the patient's medical record, and the analysis of the care provider's perceived intentions. In our previous work, we have designed a formal, machine-interpretable language, called Asbru, to represent and to annotate guidelines based on our framework, and implemented a small prototype interpreter for it.  We will implement a full interpreter for the Asbru language and a set of software tools for specification, validation, and verification of Asbru guidelines.  We will also design and implement a set of computational methods for runtime (during application) and retrospective quality assessment of clinical guideline application, both for individual patients and for populations of patients, using our intention-based model. We will rigorously test, validate, and evaluate our methodologies using collaborators in clinical areas such as oncology, hypertension, and endocrinology.    n/a",INTELLIGENT CRITIQUING OF CLINICAL-GUIDELINE APPLICATION,6530776,R01LM006806,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' experimental designs', ' health care quality', ' health services research tag', ' human data', ' medical records', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2002,322761,0.014217349878755621

"Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets Privacy is a fundamental right and needs to be protected.  For health care related d information, there are regulations for disclosure.  These regulations were motivated by the public's concern of breaches of confidentiality that might result in discrimination.  The recent progress in electronic medical record technology, the Internet, and the genetic revolution, together with media reports on violations of privacy have generated increasing interest in this topic.  A common belief is that sensitive information is more easily available with the use of networked computers. Since total lack of disclosure is not realistic, current regulations require that the ""minimal amount"" of information be given to a certain party.  A thorough study on what constitutes ""minimal"" for particular types of applications and a ""usefulness index"" is lacking.  An exact quantification of the potential for privacy breach in de-identified or anonymized databases is also lacking.  Definition and quantification of these indices is important for decision-making.  As we demonstrate, de-identified data sets can still be used for inference and therefore may disclose sensitive information.  The use of machine learning methods to verify the remaining functional dependencies in a de- identified data set leads to better understanding of the possible inferences.  Anonymization techniques based on logic, statistics, database theory, and machine learning methods can help in the protection of privacy. We will formally define and study anonymity in databases, from a theoretical and a practical standpoint.  We will develop and implement algorithms to anonymize data sets that will be in accordance with the balance of anonymity and ""usefulness"" of the disclosed data sets.  We will also develop and implement algorithms to verify the anonymity of a given data set and indicate the type of records that are at highest risk for a privacy attack.  We will make our methods and documented tools freely available to researchers via the WWW. n/a",Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets,6421732,R01LM007273,"['Internet', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' decision making', ' health care facility information system', ' health care policy', ' human data', ' human rights', ' information dissemination', ' information retrieval', ' mathematical model', ' medical records', ' model design /development', ' patient oriented research', ' statistics /biometry']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2002,384388,0.01752390125728039
"Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Narrative information is vital to health care, because it enables physicians to synthesize the raw facts and provide a context and interpretation for them.  Electronic medical record systems contain a wealth of clinical data, but typically lack the clinical narrative found in paper records, e.g., the patient history and progress notes.  Numerous barriers prevent the timely acquisition of narrative data, and most computer systems are unable to use such information productively.  Current approaches offer a tradeoff, capture of rich clinical data that lacks structure (using transcription services or speech technology), versus entry of structured data that lacks flexibility and expressiveness (using template systems).  Natural language processing can integrate these approaches by allowing physicians full freedom of expression while producing structured documents that preserve the richness and enable further computer processing.   This proposal seeks to capture and structure narrative in the online medical record in order to improve entry time, completeness, information content and consistency of clinical documentation.  The specific aims of this proposal are:  1) Maintain the continuity of the medical record; a lengthy medical record requires significant time to review and digest.  Many facts from past narratives remain true in the present or persist with minor changes.  By automatically bringing these facts forward into the current narrative, the system can reduce the time to enter the document, and improve the completeness of documentation by maintaining continuity of what is known about a patient; 2) Integrate the medical record:  Electronic medical records contain a vast amount of data.  However, most of these data are raw facts.  By helping the physician to connect, interpret and summarize these facts, the system can improve the usefulness of the information in the record, and reduce the time to enter documents by performing some syntheses automatically; and 3) Harmonize the medical record; the multidisciplinary nature of health care creates the potential for the differing perspectives and interpretations in the medical record, and even contradictions.  By bringing possible discrepancies to the attention of the physician, the system can help resolve the inconsistencies.     n/a",Using Narrative Data to Enrich the Online Medical Record,6535939,R01LM007268,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' information systems', ' medical records', ' online computer', ' primary care physician', ' vocabulary']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2002,395391,0.050825260056767296
"Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems The high cost of data entry is a critical issue that has challenged the evolution of computerized patient record systems. Development of dynamic language models is proposed for significantly improving the cost performance of medical transcription systems. The innovative use of speech recognition, computer telephony integration, and the Internet is proposed for the management and transcription of physician dictation. Results of Phase I research demonstrate significant cost savings to healthcare organizations. Our goal in Phase II is to apply multiple dynamic language models to both improve accuracy and the robustness of the system. We propose to create a physician specific mapping of historical transcriptions to their spoken counterparts. We then propose to explore different methodologies for building language models for specific physician work-type combinations using a database of processed historical transcriptions based on dictations from over 1,500 physicians. In addition, the output of the recognition system will be processed by a natural language processing engine to transform it into a formatted, styled draft transcription for review and editing by a transcriptionist. Our unique approach integrates seamlessly into a physician's workflow and does not require the alteration of physician work patterns. We expect this research and development will result in a commercially viable transcription system that significantly reduces costs associated with medical transcription. eScription has obtained three paying pilot customers with whom we are working closely with to develop this system. These customers have/will provide eScription with textual data, audio data, and medical transcriptionists who will test the final system. All have expressed a keen interest in becoming corporate partners for Phase III. Two are currently using our prototype system in their production environments today. We are submitting this grant request to partially cover the cost of constructing and testing the system. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: eScription focuses on alleviating significant healthcare cost pressures associated with transcription of medical dictation. We apply new technologies such as speech recognition, computer telephony and Internet communications, which are not commonly used for medical transcription. We will directly sell our software products and services to Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and to Transcription Services Companies.  n/a",Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems,6528412,R44LM006930,"['computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' language', ' medical records', ' speech recognition', ' telemedicine', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,"ESCRIPTION, INC.",R44,2002,325555,-0.016655024395379504
"PACS INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT-BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE The broad, tong-term objective of this Program Project Grant is to develop an effective imaging-based information and health care delivery system to support clinical practice, research, and education. The specific aims of the grant are to: (1) evolve PACS into an effective infrastructure that promotes the objectification of subjective patient clinical symptoms, (2) develop methods for improving the characterization of medical data through structured data collection, natural language processing of medical reports (NLP) and parametric summarization for medical images, (3) provide flexible, patient -specific presentation methods of medical images, timelines, and structured medical data. The objectification, intelligent access, and flexible presentation of medical data provide better information, which will facilitate the evidence-based practice of medicine and enhance research and evaluation. Five integrated projects employ novel techniques to address specific elements of the system. Intelligently selected imaging protocols are used to objectify patient symptoms. Well-defined information units capture and structure diverse forms of data, whether directly or indirectly through NP for text of parametric summarization for images. Patient medical records are correlated with medical literature by content. Timelines organize the data into a format that allow medical events, their dependencies, and conditional trends to be easily visualized (Project 3). Scenario-based proxies provide up-to-date access to relevant medical information. Relaxation broadens queries to medical information when exact matches are not found. Software toolkits and user models enable user-, and domain-, and task-specific customizations. The hardware independent architecture will facilitate access to the system across different platforms and software subsystems. Together, they form a unique infrastructure that provides broad and intelligently customized access to well-defined structured data and up-to-date literature. This, in addition to patient-specific relevant data, expert opinion, and similar cases with known outcome, will promote the evidence-based practice of medicine.

"DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES A real-time clinical repository contains a wealth of detailed information useful for clinical care, research, and administration.  In their raw form, however, the data are difficult to use there is too much volume, too much detail, missing values, and inaccuracies. Clinicians, researchers, and administrators require higher level interpretations that address their questions. For example, a clinician may need to know whether a patient is at sufficient risk for having active tuberculosis to warrant respiratory isolation. The answer to the question may be spread around the clinical repository in chest radiographs, laboratory tests, medication histories, vital signs, and physician's notes. Translating from these raw data to the interpretation (at risk or not) is a difficult and laborious task. The hypothesis of this proposal is that data mining techniques can be applied to a real-time clinical repository to discover knowledge and generate accurate clinical interpretations, and that these interpretations can be automated. The project differs from earlier machine learning studies in its emphasis on a real clinical repository and the use of natural language processing to supply coded clinical data. The specific aims are: (l) Select clinical domains--Several clinical domains with interesting, non-trivial clinical problems will be selected. Problems for which a gold standard answer can or has been assembled for a retrospective cohort will be chosen. (2) Prepare raw clinical data for mining--The raw data from a clinical repository will be transformed into a structure that facilitates data mining. The data will be flattened, pivoted, summarized, and mapped as needed for the domains. Narrative data will be coded using the MedLEE natural language processor. The preparation process will be automated. (3) Use data mining algorithms to discover knowledge- Several data mining algorithms will be applied to the selected clinical domains. Algorithms will include decision tree generation, rule discovery, neural networks, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and composite algorithms (for variable reduction). The algorithms will be trained on a training set for each domain, and their predictive accuracy will be measured and compared to each other and to expert-written rules. The performance of human experts writing rules using manual data mining visualization techniques (which does not require an explicit training set) will also be measured. (4) Study the dependence of data mining on the training set--The performance of data mining algorithms depends on the data used the train them. The sensitivity of the algorithms to noise (inaccurate data), missing data, and training set size will be measured. (5) Use the discovered knowledge to generate real-time interpretations-- The output of the algorithms (decision tree, rules, neural network equation, or logistic regression equation, but not nearest neighbor) along with the necessary data preparation steps will be encoded in Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules. They will be run against the clinical repository to verify that the interpretation can be automated in real time. (6) Disseminate the methods and results--The methods and results will be disseminated via publications and a Web site, and tools will be made available.  n/a",DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES,6391286,R01LM006910,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information dissemination', ' information system analysis', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2001,396315,0.006231933670207616
"UMLS ENHANCED DYNAMIC AGENTS TO MANAGE MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                             With the explosion of medical information accessible via the Internet, there         is a growing need for development of better access to the online medical             literature databases through user-friendly systems and interface.  The               proliferation of online information and the diversity of interfaces to data          collections has led to a medical information gap between medical researchers         and the accessibility of medical literature databases.  Users who need access        to such information must visit a variety of sources, which can be both               excessively time consuming and potentially dangerous if the information is           needed for treatment decisions.  In addition, information generated by using         existing search engines is often too general or inaccurate.  Particularly            frustrating is that simple queries can result in an excessive number of              documents retrieved - too many to search through to determine which are and          which are not relevant.

"Mining Complex Clinical Data for Patient Safety Research Medical errors hurt patients, cost money, and undermine the health care system. The first step to reducing errors is detecting them, for what cannot be detected cannot be managed. A number of approaches have been applied to medical error detection, including mandatory event reporting, voluntary near-miss reporting, chart review, and automated surveillance using information systems. Automated surveillance promises large-scale detection, minimal labor, and, potentially, detection in real time to prevent or recover from errors. Unfortunately, large amounts of important clinical information lie locked in narrative reports, unavailable to automated decision support systems. A number of tools have emerged from medical informatics and computer science- natural language processing, visualization tools, and machine learning- as well as methods for understanding cognitive processes. We hypothesize that the electronic medical record contains information useful for detecting errors and that natural language processing and other tools will allow us to retrieve the information. We will assemble a team skilled in natural language processing, data mining, terminology, patient safety research, and health care. We will use a clinical repository with ten years of data on two million patients. It includes administrative, laboratory, and pharmacy coded information as well as a wide range of narrative reports including discharge summaries, operative reports, outpatient notes, autopsy reports, resident signout notes, nursing notes, and reports from numerous ancillary services (radiology, pathology, etc.). We will apply a proven natural language processor called MedLEE to code the information and measure the accuracy of automated queries to detect and characterize errors. We will target several areas: explicit error reporting in the medical record, NYPORTS mandatory event reporting, clinical conflicts in record, and other sources of error information. We will use a systems approach to errors and cognitive analysis to uncover cues to improve error detection. We will incorporate the system into the hospital's current event surveillance program and assess the impact on error detection. We will adhere to strict privacy policies and security procedures. This project represents a unique opportunity to apply the most advanced medical language processing system to a large, comprehensive clinical repository to advance patient safety research.  n/a",Mining Complex Clinical Data for Patient Safety Research,6448720,R18HS011806,"['automated medical record system', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' health service demonstration project', ' human data', ' iatrogenic disease', ' patient care', ' patient safety /medical error']",AHRQ,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R18,2001,356099,0.02345060668424049
"LATENT SEMANTIC INDEXING IN SUPPORT OF DATA RETRIEVAL We propose to extend the successful work we have achieved with                   statistically based indexing and retrieval systems, by incorporating             semantic structures which accommodate the modifying attributes of clinical       conCepts.

"Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems The high cost of data entry is a critical issue that has challenged the evolution of computerized patient record systems. Development of dynamic language models is proposed for significantly improving the cost performance of medical transcription systems. The innovative use of speech recognition, computer telephony integration, and the Internet is proposed for the management and transcription of physician dictation. Results of Phase I research demonstrate significant cost savings to healthcare organizations. Our goal in Phase II is to apply multiple dynamic language models to both improve accuracy and the robustness of the system. We propose to create a physician specific mapping of historical transcriptions to their spoken counterparts. We then propose to explore different methodologies for building language models for specific physician work-type combinations using a database of processed historical transcriptions based on dictations from over 1,500 physicians. In addition, the output of the recognition system will be processed by a natural language processing engine to transform it into a formatted, styled draft transcription for review and editing by a transcriptionist. Our unique approach integrates seamlessly into a physician's workflow and does not require the alteration of physician work patterns. We expect this research and development will result in a commercially viable transcription system that significantly reduces costs associated with medical transcription. eScription has obtained three paying pilot customers with whom we are working closely with to develop this system. These customers have/will provide eScription with textual data, audio data, and medical transcriptionists who will test the final system. All have expressed a keen interest in becoming corporate partners for Phase III. Two are currently using our prototype system in their production environments today. We are submitting this grant request to partially cover the cost of constructing and testing the system. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: eScription focuses on alleviating significant healthcare cost pressures associated with transcription of medical dictation. We apply new technologies such as speech recognition, computer telephony and Internet communications, which are not commonly used for medical transcription. We will directly sell our software products and services to Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and to Transcription Services Companies.  n/a",Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems,6404288,R44LM006930,"['computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' language', ' medical records', ' speech recognition', ' telemedicine', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,"ESCRIPTION, INC.",R44,2001,673495,-0.016655024395379504
"INFORMATION PROCESSING IN MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE This application is a request for support of the July 2001 meeting on Information Processing in Medical Imaging (IPMI'01) to be held on the campus of the University of California, Davis. During 16 previous meetings, this biennial workshop-style conference has traditionally concentrated on the latest advancements in the acquisition, processing, analysis, display, and perception of medical images.

"DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES A real-time clinical repository contains a wealth of detailed information useful for clinical care, research, and administration.  In their raw form, however, the data are difficult to use there is too much volume, too much detail, missing values, and inaccuracies. Clinicians, researchers, and administrators require higher level interpretations that address their questions. For example, a clinician may need to know whether a patient is at sufficient risk for having active tuberculosis to warrant respiratory isolation. The answer to the question may be spread around the clinical repository in chest radiographs, laboratory tests, medication histories, vital signs, and physician's notes. Translating from these raw data to the interpretation (at risk or not) is a difficult and laborious task. The hypothesis of this proposal is that data mining techniques can be applied to a real-time clinical repository to discover knowledge and generate accurate clinical interpretations, and that these interpretations can be automated. The project differs from earlier machine learning studies in its emphasis on a real clinical repository and the use of natural language processing to supply coded clinical data. The specific aims are: (l) Select clinical domains--Several clinical domains with interesting, non-trivial clinical problems will be selected. Problems for which a gold standard answer can or has been assembled for a retrospective cohort will be chosen. (2) Prepare raw clinical data for mining--The raw data from a clinical repository will be transformed into a structure that facilitates data mining. The data will be flattened, pivoted, summarized, and mapped as needed for the domains. Narrative data will be coded using the MedLEE natural language processor. The preparation process will be automated. (3) Use data mining algorithms to discover knowledge- Several data mining algorithms will be applied to the selected clinical domains. Algorithms will include decision tree generation, rule discovery, neural networks, nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and composite algorithms (for variable reduction). The algorithms will be trained on a training set for each domain, and their predictive accuracy will be measured and compared to each other and to expert-written rules. The performance of human experts writing rules using manual data mining visualization techniques (which does not require an explicit training set) will also be measured. (4) Study the dependence of data mining on the training set--The performance of data mining algorithms depends on the data used the train them. The sensitivity of the algorithms to noise (inaccurate data), missing data, and training set size will be measured. (5) Use the discovered knowledge to generate real-time interpretations-- The output of the algorithms (decision tree, rules, neural network equation, or logistic regression equation, but not nearest neighbor) along with the necessary data preparation steps will be encoded in Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules. They will be run against the clinical repository to verify that the interpretation can be automated in real time. (6) Disseminate the methods and results--The methods and results will be disseminated via publications and a Web site, and tools will be made available.  n/a",DISCOVERING AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN CLINICAL DATABASES,6031325,R01LM006910,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' health care facility information system', ' human data', ' information dissemination', ' information system analysis', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2000,433383,0.006231933670207616
"IMIA WG6 CONFERENCE The basic science of representing patient events, findings, interventions, and outcomes in a semantically consistent and logically reproducible way is medical concept representation.  It embodies principles of linguistics, logic, computer science, cognition, biology and clinical medicine to undertake this highly multidisciplinary activity.

"KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR STRUCTURED CARDIOVASCULAR REPORTING Healthcare has lagged behind other industries in automating the storage and retrieval of information. While billing, blood testing, and other services are widely computerized, the bulk of patient clinical information is not. The central barrier to coding clinically useful data - patient historical, test, and procedural results - is the absence of effective knowledge frameworks for entry and review of clinical data. For this reason, sofiware for storage and retrieval of patient data remains suboptimal. This project focuses on methods for recording a specific subset of patient data: results of cardiovascular tests, Although only a subset of clinical knowledge, cardiovascular procedure reporting is typical of the larger problem of how knowledge is handled. Moreover, there is an unmet market demand for cardiology reportrng tools. In Phase I we will develop a methodology for creating and maintaining the knowledge bases needed for structured entry of cardiovascular data. We will apply and hone this methodology by creating two important knowledge bases: echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. Together with the methodology we use, these two developments will dovetail into a larger Phase II  project of systematically addressing knowledge-representation and structured data entry for cardiology. Beyond Phase II  we will apply our methodology to other branches of medicine. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: This research will provide a means to optimize structured recording of patient test results in a computer-searchable format improving the process of procedural reporting, and facilitating implementation of an electronic medical record.  n/a",KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR STRUCTURED CARDIOVASCULAR REPORTING,6141030,R43HL062806,"['artificial intelligence', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' data management', ' echocardiography', ' heart catheterization', ' human data', ' informatics']",NHLBI,"CYBERPULSE, LLC",R43,2000,107000,0.008922074089970207

"DECISION ANALYTIC SUPPORT FOR CLINICAL GUIDELINES DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  In the rapidly changing          health care environment the increasing prominence of managed care has            prompted a greater reliance on formal clinical guidelines to suppose             clinical decisions.  Guidelines have been advocated with increasing              frequency to reduce inappropriate care, control geographic variations in         practice patterns and make more effective use of health care resources.          However, guidelines often have little impact on clinical practice because        physicians are unaware of them, lack confidence in them because the              justification for their recommendations is not clear or because they are         inaccessible at the time of patient care or difficult to apply.  Guidelines      also quickly become out of date as new research data becomes available.                                                                                           In order to enhance the quality and usefulness of clinical guidelines, the       general goal of this project is to develop, deploy and evaluate interactive      computer based guidelines, supported by an integrated decision theoretic         model and a linked knowledge base.  This arrangement will use patient            characteristics to tailor guideline advice to the individual patient.  The       integrated decision model will provide recommendations for situations not        addressed by the guideline and also will help to justify guideline               recommendations by calculating the effectiveness and costs of various            strategies.  The proposed system also contains links to a knowledge base         containing the sources of data used in the guideline and the model, so that      physicians using the system can examine the studies supporting the guideline     recommendations.  Natural language explanations, generated automatically         based on the structure of the decision model and the guideline will justify      the recommendations.  A query capability will enable physicians to look up       specific data from the knowledge base.  The linked knowledge based also          ensures that the supported decision model and guideline will be updated          automatically as new research data is published.                                                                                                                  The computer system will be used to implement an interactive version of the      Guidelines for Medical Treatment for Stroke Prevention, developed by the         American College of Physicians.  The system will be bench tested using a         series of cases abstracted from the General Medicine practice at the Robert      Wood Johnson Medical School.  Faculty and house staff internists will serve      as research subjects to perform a field trial of the system.  This will          include the extent of previous compliance with the guideline, pre and            post-testing of medical knowledge pertinent to the guideline, and the degree     to which the computer-based guideline changes behavior compared to the           traditional guideline format.  A decision theoretic measure of potential         benefit will be calculated by comparing decision model evaluations of            physicians' unaided choices with those recommended by the guideline system.       n/a",DECISION ANALYTIC SUPPORT FOR CLINICAL GUIDELINES,6185218,R01LM006321,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' human data', ' human subject', ' information systems', ' medical records', ' physicians', ' questionnaires', ' stroke']",NLM,UNIV OF MED/DENT NJ-R W JOHNSON MED SCH,R01,2000,248558,0.012682858947840976

"Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques Project Summary/Abstract: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting over eight million Americans, of whom 100,000 a year suffer major amputation. Current guidelines dictate medical treatment and aggressive risk factor modification for all PAD patients, whether symptomatic or not, with revascularization attempts for patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) or lifestyle-limiting claudication. Despite strongly-worded standards of care, variability in PAD outcomes persists. Prior research has demonstrated that some demographic factors such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status are associated with worse PAD care and outcomes even when controlling for comorbidities. It is unknown what specific patient, provider, and healthcare system factors lead to these disparities. Efforts to understand which patients will suffer worse outcomes and disease progression have been hampered by contemporary outcomes research techniques. The majority of PAD outcomes research relies on administrative claims databases, procedural registries, or single center retrospective reviews. While each of these methods has some advantages, none offer the combination of patient- and disease-specific data, information about care provision on a provider and health-system level, and outcomes across a range of possible locations. Furthermore, use of any of these methods at the scale necessary to draw powerful conclusions is prohibitively time- and resource-intensive. The overall objective of this research is to use a novel natural language processing model to build a combined EHR/CMS database and to use that database to predict which PAD patients are at highest risk of poor outcomes with improved power and precision. This proposal contains plans for collaboration with Duke Forge, who bring expertise in natural language processing and machine learning in order to efficiently identify PAD patients within our EHR and efficiently abstract information about them. Once identified, these patients can be linked to their CMS outcomes, allowing for assessment of how patient-, physician-, and healthcare-specific factors affect PAD outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that natural language processing powered by machine learning will permit efficient identification of patients with PAD, thereby facilitating higher-powered and higher-quality investigation into disparities in PAD outcomes. This research will pave the way for future interventions targeting sources of outcome inequality, possibly including access to care, physician adherence to national guidelines, and patient preferences or health literacy. Project Narrative: Peripheral arterial disease affects more than eight million Americans, with over one hundred thousand amputations performed yearly. Despite the prevalence and morbidity of this disease, there is a lack of knowledge about which patients will require amputation, multiple surgeries or hospitalizations, or suffer cardiovascular- related death. This proposal uses natural language processing to improve on current research methodology in order to account for patient-specific, physician-specific, and system-specific factors in peripheral arterial disease care and outcomes.",Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques,10066805,F32HL151181,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Inequality', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Technics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'claudication', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,82476,-0.01574470922114275

"A framework to stratify patient cohorts for clinical management PROJECT SUMMARY  Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have limited functionality to find patients that can benefit by particular interventions. Hence, clinicians are unable to proactively reach-out to these patients, leading to an ever-widening evidence-care gap. The goal of this proposal is to improve healthcare delivery. The objective is to develop a data-framework for accurately finding patients that can benefits from large/population scale interventions. We will investigate two dimensions for improving the patient search—increasing the resolution of the search (aim 1) and increasing the quality of the data that the search is performed on (aim 2). In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that a rule-based model of the relevant clinical guideline, will find patients with higher accuracy than the conventional queries. The rational is that the rule-based approach will allow complex groupings of the eligibility criteria and will thereby provide a higher resolution of search than conventional query. In aim 2 we will investigate whether machine learning (ML) can improve the accuracy of patient data and contribute to the accuracy of search results obtained through the conventional query and the guideline rule-base. In addition to the above aims, in aim 3 we will automate deployment of the rule-base and ML models and minimize the manual effort for developing ML models. This proposal builds on the lipid management program at Brigham and Women's hospital (BWH). Our work will be focused on finding patients for lipid- management; however, our methodology and tooling will be generalizable to other medical areas and institutions. The study team includes national experts in cardiology, machine learning, health information technology (HIT) and open-source software development. We will create an open-source software platform (i2b2-ML) by extending the popular `Informatics for Integration Biology and the Bedside' (i2b2) platform that we have developed and supported over the past 10 years and that is used by over 200 medical centers. I2b2-ML will extend i2b2's proven ability to characterize patient cohorts for research into the clinical realm. Our study will yield methodology for accurately finding patients that can benefit by clinical intervention and will thereby enable cost-effectiveness of population programs. It will directly help scale the lipid management program at BWH to benefit a wider patient population. Our detailed characterization of the gaps in lipid management at a large healthcare system will potentially inform improvements in the lipid management guideline. The methodology and tooling developed in this project will be disseminated in open-source for potential incorporation in the clinical data infrastructure at other institutions, which will facilitate implementation of population-scale clinical programs across the nation. In addition, the resultant infrastructure will serve as a platform for development of artificial intelligence-based applications to improve clinical care. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact on health care delivery so that more patients will get the optimal care. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose developing Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), a well-established, open source, platform that is currently used at over 200 hospitals and medical centers to use machine learning for identifying patient groups receiving suboptimal care. The proposed work will enable healthcare institutions across the United States to proactively reach-out to these patients, for delivering the appropriate clinical intervention.

"An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to combine expertise and approaches from biomedical engineering and critical care medicine to design a universal system to acquire, record and transmit physiological signals from bedside monitored patients. Patient monitors generate over a million datapoints of information per hour, however, only a tiny fraction of those data are transmitted or recorded. In order to improve data exchange in healthcare, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was published in 2014. However, it has yet to make a significant impact on Medical Device Integration (MDI), which is the process of automating the flow of clinical data from bedside medical devices, such as patient monitors, to external systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Also, MDI is a complex task because data from these devices are high-frequency and high- volume and because most devices use proprietary protocols and outdated interfaces such as serial cables. Hospitals and researchers have therefore been left with few options except to use expensive and vendor-specific MDI solutions to access these data or to use manual data entry into the patient EMR, which leads to data entry errors, late entry of data, and lost time for clinical care. Manual data entry only captures a tiny fraction of the available data, and with increased research interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, there is a growing need for a standardized way to access the vast amounts of data from bedside devices. This project will develop a vendor-neutral software-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) that acquires and records data from bedside devices across a hospital network and makes live data available to 3rd party systems using a FHIR application programming interface (API). The proposed proof-of-concept will consist of three elements: [i] a transmitter which encrypts and transmits patient signals across the network, [ii] an aggregator which receives, translates and records the signals to a central location, and [iii] a FHIR Server with API for allowing external systems to access live data as FHIR resources. This proposal seeks to create a novel design that will overcome a critical barrier in healthcare, medicine and research. The proposed MDDS will be valuable to hospitals, clinicians, researchers and app developers because it makes data accessible which were previously only available to clinicians at the bedside in real-time. Narrative MediCollector’s proposed vendor-neutral medical device data system (MDDS) will be a valuable research tool to access, acquire and record high-frequency bedside patient monitor data for facilitating clinical research in hospitals. In addition, it will make live patient monitor data accessible to external systems through an HL7 FHIR application programming interface (API), thereby improving interoperability in hospitals and opening the doors to the integration of live data into external systems, such as smartphone apps and artificial intelligence algorithms, which can improve clinical workflow and healthcare in general.",An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment,10140938,R43EB030890,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Boston', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Information Systems', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Patients&apos', ' Rooms', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Sum', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vendor', 'Ventilator', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'design', 'encryption', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'point of care', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIBIB,"MEDICOLLECTOR, LLC",R43,2020,210642,0.02611147213070457
"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction. Aim 4 is to evaluate our similarity framework for predicting 1) the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in general EHR patient population and 2) the risk of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The project focus on developing a novel data science pipeline which includes a clinical data processing pipeline to format comprehensive patient health determinants from a variety of sources of clinical, genomic, socioenvironmental data, and a clinical-outcome-prediction framework that optimally fuses relevant patient health determinants to define patient similarity for improved clinical risk predictions.",Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction,9870948,R01LM013061,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'feature selection', 'health data', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'vector']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,420434,-0.024254830787207343
"Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care Summary: Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care  A future vision of clinical decision support must transcend constraints in scalability, maintainability, and adaptability. The shortage of 100,000 physicians by 2030 reflects unmet (and unlimited) demand for the scarcest healthcare resource, clinical expertise. Over 25 million in the US alone have deficient access to medical specialty care, with delays contributing to 20% higher mortality. There is no quality without access.  Our goal is to develop a radically different paradigm for outpatient specialty consultations by inductively learning clinical workups embedded in clinical data. We focus on predicting the concrete clinical orders for medications and diagnostic tests that result from specialty consultations. This can power a tier of fully automated guides that will enable clinicians to initiate care that would otherwise await in-person specialty visits, opening access for more patients.  The major scientific barriers are advances in data science and decision support methods for collating clinical knowledge, with continuous improvement through clinical experience, crowdsourcing, and machine learning. Our innovative approach is inspired by collaborative filtering algorithms that power “Customers like you also bought this...” recommender systems with the scalability to answer unlimited queries, maintainability through statistical learning, and adaptability to respond to evolving clinical practices.  Our team uniquely combines expertise in clinical medicine, electronic medical records, clinical decision support, statistics and machine learning to enhance medical specialty consultations through aims that seek to: (1) Develop methods to generate clinical decision support by predicting the clinical orders that will result from Endocrinology and Hematology specialty consultations; (2) Evaluate and iteratively design clinical collaborative filtering prototypes based on clinical user input on usability and acceptability; and (3) Determine which consult clinical order patterns are associated with better results through reinforcement learning and causal inference frameworks. Completion of these aims will yield a sustained, powerful impact on clinical information retrieval and knowledge discovery for synthesizing clinical practices from real-world data. By addressing grand challenges in clinical decision support, adoption of these methods will fulfill a vision that empowers clinicians to practice to the top of their license, making healthcare more scalable in reach, responsiveness, and reproducibility Project Narrative There can be no quality without access, and over 25 million in the US alone have deficient access to the scarcest healthcare resource: Human medical expertise. Building on methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed research will automatically learn practice patterns from electronic medical records. Distributing predictable practices of medical specialty consultations can then enable healthcare systems to achieve broader patient access to timely and consistent care.",Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care,10265158,R56LM013365,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Electronic Mail', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hematology', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hyperthyroidism', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Retrieval', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Specialist', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'data streams', 'design', 'experience', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized decision', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2020,394250,0.017807376362337257
"Automated Knowledge Engineering Methods to Improve Consumers' Comprehension of their Health Records PROJECT SUMMARY  Today, more patients can access their health records online than ever before. However, clinical acronyms hinder patients' comprehension of their records and decrease the benefits of transparency. An automated system for expanding clinical acronyms should have major clinical significance and far-reaching consequences for improving patient-provider communication, shared decision-making, and health outcomes. Existing systems have limited power to expand clinical acronyms, primarily due to the lack of comprehensiveness (or generali- zability) of existing acronym sense inventories. Because developing comprehensive sense inventories is difficult, existing knowledge engineering methods have primarily focused on developing institution-specific sense inventories. Institution-specific sense inventories may not be generalizable to other geographical regions and medical specialties. Furthermore, developing an institution-specific sense inventory at every US healthcare organization is not feasible, especially without automated methods which currently do not exist.  I developed advanced knowledge engineering methods to overcome these limitations through the use of fully automated techniques to generalize existing sense inventories from different geographical regions and medical specialties. My methods leverage the extensive resources already devoted to developing institution- specific sense inventories in the U.S., and may help generalize existing sense inventories to institutions without the resources to develop them. Although promising, challenges remain with the optimization and evaluation of these methods. The objective of the proposed project is to use knowledge engineering to improve patients' comprehension of their health records, focusing specifically on clinical acronyms. In Aim 1, I will develop new knowledge engineering methods to facilitate the automated integration of sense inventories, using literature- based quality heuristics and a Siamese neural network to establish synonymy. I will evaluate these methods using multiple metrics to assess redundancy, quality, and coverage in two test corpora with over 17 million clinical notes. In Aim 2, I will evaluate whether the knowledge engineering methods improve comprehension of doctors' notes in 60 hospitalized patients with advanced heart failure. With success, I will create novel, automated knowledge engineering methods that can be directly applied to improve patient care. This research is in support of my mentored doctoral training at Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) under Drs. David Vawdrey, George Hripcsak, Carol Friedman, Suzanne Bakken, and Chunhua Weng, and will include coursework on deep learning, oral presentations at major annual conferences, and career development planning, among other activities. DBMI is frequently recognized as one of the oldest and best programs of its kind in the world, and provides an exception training environment for my development into an independent and productive academic investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical acronyms make it difficult for patients to understand their medical records, decreasing the benefits of transparency. This project applies advanced knowledge engineering methods and machine learning to generate comprehensive acronym sense inventories used to aid consumers' comprehension of their health records.

"Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities In the United States (US), an estimated 20 million adults have been diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD). A major challenge for patients is to identify the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes. Patients receive care in outpatient and inpatient facilities yet quality metrics at the level of these individual facilities are not publicly available.  In the era of digital data, the Internet and peer-to-peer resources are often the first place where individuals look to find information about healthcare resources. Online reviews on sites like Google and Yelp provide narratives about healthcare facilities and assign easily interpretable star ratings ranging from one to five stars. These reviews of healthcare facilities provide information about patient experience, structure (e.g. physical education) facility, organizational characteristics, payment methods), process (e.g. diagnosis, treatment, patient and outcomes (e.g. knowledge, health-related quality of life morbidity, mortality).  Prior work has demonstrated that online ratings of hospitals correlate with ratings from the national Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Little work however has evaluated the utility of unvalidated, spontaneously generated, but widely accessible online reviews of SUD treatment facilities. These reviews could fill a niche with providing patients and their family members with useful information about the questions and experiences that are most important to them. Or these reviews could be limited and provide misinformation or only biased perspectives. To date, less is known about the potential value or usefulness of this emerging data source.  For this proposal we aim to study online reviews of SUD treatment facilities in the US to identify the areas of care that are reported as most important to patients and family members. For Aim 1, we will first extract approximately 50,000 online reviews of SUD treatment facilities and code them for themes using qualitative methodologies that involve manual coding and big data analytics using machine learning and natural language processing. We hypothesize that these online narratives will include qualitative data about patient experience and the type and quality of care (e.g. evidence-based treatments) provided at SUD treatment facilities. For Aim 2, we will then assess how star ratings differentiate facilities relative to structure and process measures reported in the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services.  Overall, emerging online data resources have the potential to provide new information about a critically vulnerable population affected by the opioid and more broadly the SUD crisis. Our project seeks to rigorously study these new patient-centric data sources viewed by millions of individuals for the purposes of better understanding the needs of patients and family members. These efforts can lay the groundwork for future work in developing measures of quality for a critically important healthcare resource, SUD treatment facilities. Narrative We aim to evaluate narratives and star ratings from online reviews to assess how this consumer generated, data can inform our understanding of care delivery for substance use disorder (SUD). Identifying the themes and measures of quality revealed in these reviews and how they relate to traditional measures of quality could inform future development of patient centric performance measures and ratings for SUD treatment facilities.",Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities,9956035,R21DA050761,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Addiction', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physical Education', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'data resource', 'digital', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'payment', 'peer', 'satisfaction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'urgent care', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2020,243000,-0.0011371682254204835
"Developing scalable algorithms to incorporate unstructured electronic health records for causal inference based on real-world data Project Summary/Abstract The routine operation of the US Healthcare system produces an abundance of electronically-stored data that captures the care of patients as it is provided in settings outside of controlled research environments. The potential for utilizing these data to inform future treatment choices and improve patient care and outcomes of all patients in the very system that generates the data is widely acknowledged. Given these key properties of the routine-care data and the abundance of electronic healthcare databases covering millions of patients, it is critical to strengthen the rigor of analyses of such data. Our group has previously developed an analytic approach to reduce bias when analyzing routine-care databases, which has proven effective in more than 50 empirical research studies across a range of topics and data sources. However, this approach currently cannot incorporate free-text information that is recorded in electronic health records, such as clinical notes and reports. This limitation has left a large amount of rich patient information underutilized for clinical research. We thus aim to adapt and refine a set of established computerized natural language processing algorithms that can identify and extract useful information from the clinical notes and reports in electronic health records and incorporate them into our validated analytical approach for balancing background risks of different comparison groups, a key step to ensure fair evaluation when comparing different therapeutic options. To test this newly integrated and augmented approach, we will implement and adapt it in simulation studies where we can evaluate and improve the performance of these new analytic methods in a controlled but realistic fashion. In addition, we will assess the performance of our new approach in 8 practical studies comparing medical or surgical treatments that are highly relevant to patients. To ensure highest level of data completeness and quality, we have linked multiple healthcare utilization (claims) databases, spanning from 2007 to 2016, with 3 electronic health records systems, including one each in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Texas. This data will allow testing of our newly integrated approach in a variety of care delivery systems and data environments, which will be very informative for the application of our products in the real-world settings. Narrative The project will yield a highly flexible and effective analytical method for reducing confounding bias in studies that utilize routine-care data to compare effects of medical or surgical treatments. This method will enable researchers to leverage a large amount of patient information recorded in the clinical notes and reports that are contained within electronic health records to adjust for differences in background risks of different comparison groups. Our proposal can improve the quality of evidence based on electronic healthcare data generated in the routine-care settings to better inform patient care and optimal prescribing.",Developing scalable algorithms to incorporate unstructured electronic health records for causal inference based on real-world data,9970594,R01LM013204,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Empirical Research', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Influentials', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'North Carolina', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'health care service utilization', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'routine care', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'sound', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'unstructured data']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,469927,-0.019056394439558606
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,10003227,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'feature selection', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,506170,0.008844368144573341
"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed project aims to make healthcare safer through collection of patient-centered outcomes as the input data to support a safety and improvement model of the Learning Health System (LHS). The project will accomplish these aims by leveraging existing machine learning methods to classify free text documents, such as clinician notes, for the presence or absence of specific events of interest. The project shares this focus with two long-term objectives. The first broad project goal is to collect important data to address knowledge gaps in the incidence and clinical epidemiology of 5 serious pediatric inpatient healthcare acquired conditions (HACs). These 5 HACs are: peripheral IV infiltrates, venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), pressure injuries, patient falls, and incidents involving harm to providers. The second goal is to evaluate a novel approach to routine patient safety event surveillance that is scalable, transferrable, adaptable to other conditions and settings, and with low cost of sustainable ongoing operation. The project has two specific aims to achieve these goals:  Aim 1: Implement enhanced surveillance for 5 pediatric HACs. Compare characteristics  of previously and newly identified cases. Describe high-risk populations.  Aim 2: Estimate completeness of existing systems. Evaluate effects of enhanced  surveillance on quality improvement activities; incidence of HACs; and cost to operate  system, including staff time and resources. The project team has developed a machine learning interface implemented in open license Windows software. The team has a lengthy track record making these methods accessible to clinicians and lay users in research, clinical operations, quality improvement, and injury prevention settings. The current project proposes an innovative application of these technologies, methods, and tools to the important problem of patient safety surveillance. An expected outcome of this project will be substantial advance in knowledge for each of the 5 pediatric HACs proposed for enhanced surveillance. Results will be reported in terms of existing data completeness and clinical epidemiology. Findings will directly address concerns over limitations of existing data sources and thereby drive patient safety improvement activities. An additional expected outcome will be the rigorous evaluation of a novel approach to patient safety surveillance. This will include analysis of the costs and benefits of enhanced surveillance with machine learning versus current approaches, and the cost-effectiveness of the approach compared to reliance on existing data, and external validation at a partner community hospital. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project addresses important challenges to reduce common sources of harm in pediatric healthcare, namely the “Healthcare-Acquired Conditions (HACs)” monitored by the National Solutions for Patient Safety quality improvement initiative. It uses a new approach to identify previously unreported safety events that affect hospitalized pediatric patients. The findings from these studies will identify high-risk patient populations and new approaches for quality improvement to reduce the frequency of these events of harm among hospitalized children.",Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes,10003310,R01HS026246,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,390145,0.011311544410960118
"Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic cigarettes were developed in China in the early 2000s and first introduced to the US market in 2007. Once established in the US, the product experienced explosive growth, with the number of electronic cigarette users doubling every year between 2008 and 2012. In 2012, it was estimated that 75% of US adults had heard of electronic cigarettes, and 8% had tried them. While electronic cigarettes have been studied over the last sev- eral years, no scientific consensus has emerged regarding either the safety of electronic cigarettes, or their po- tential as a smoking cessation aid. With this proposal, we will investigate how electronic cigarette use is documented in the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record, focusing specifically on the relationship between electronic cigarette use and com- bustible tobacco use, with the goal of understanding both how electronic cigarette use is documented in the context of the United States’ only nationwide health system, and how electronic cigarette related information can be reliably extracted from narrative clinical text using fully automated Natural Language Processing meth- ods. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research focuses on the use of Natural Language Processing methods to automatically extract mentions of electronic cigarette use from the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record. The research will provide insight into important, currently unresolved questions regarding how clinicians record electronic cigarette use in the context of a nationwide health system, and whether patients report the use of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid or use the devices in conjunction with combustible tobacco.",Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR,9852435,R03DA047577,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Professional Organizations', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Smoking', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'authority', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic hookah', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'smoking cessation', 'structured data', 'success', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'vape pens']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2020,76250,-0.024978717987530694
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career.

"Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool Existing methods for surveillance of patient harm in the ED setting are inadequate, without any meaningful change in decades. Trigger tools, popularized by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Global Trigger Tool, have been developed for multiple clinical areas and are used across the world, outperform traditional approaches for surveillance of adverse events. These tools use a two-tiered review process where a nurse screens records for triggers (predefined findings that make the presence of an AE more likely) and reviews records with triggers for AEs, discarding those without triggers. We developed a consensus-based ED trigger tool (EDTT) using a multicenter, transdisciplinary modified Delphi approach, subsequently pilot testing this in a multicenter fashion with encouraging results. This was followed by a recently completed, AHRQ-funded single center study to automate, refine and validate this tool. This study demonstrated that the EDTT is a high-yield and efficient instrument for identifying adverse events in the ED. The present study will evaluate the refined, automated EDTT), in a multicenter study. We will evaluate the EDTT’s generalizability and robustness at three sites with large emergency departments, with a planned in-depth review of 9,000 ED admissions. We will use natural language processing of electronic medical record narratives and machine learning to improve the EDTT efficiency in trigger detection and AE discovery. We will establish the basis for a wider use and prepare for scalability and usability of the tool, creating standardized, streamlined and free online training materials, and by evaluating the tool in a real-world manner consistent with intended use. Project Narrative Commonly used approaches in Emergency Departments to detect adverse events are low yield and have not changed in decades, providing inadequate surveillance for patient harm. The need for improved methodology is critical, given the evolving role of the emergency department in the health care system. Trigger tools, developed for use in many healthcare settings across the world, detect all-cause harm, helping direct resources by identifying areas of risk and allowing an assessment of the effectiveness of quality improvement efforts over time. Trigger tools involve screening of records by a nurse for triggers (findings that make an adverse event more likely) and a review of only records with triggers searching for adverse events. Any events identified undergo confirmatory physician review. We developed a trigger tool for the ED, applying rigorous methods to identify predictive triggers, to computerize the screen for triggers eliminating manual review and improving record selection to enhance yield and efficiency. This tool demonstrates superior performance for detecting adverse events. We will now test this tool in a multicenter project to evaluate its broad application, confirming its utility and to continue to improve its yield and efficiency in adverse event detection by applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques.",Multicenter Study of the Emergency Department Trigger Tool,10098792,R01HS027811,[' '],AHRQ,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,398528,0.009280204790912518

"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9926311,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,348620,0.026033147594214857
"Collaborative Research: Statistical algorithms for anomaly detection and patterns recognition in patient care and safety event reports Medical errors have been shown to be the third leading cause of death in the United States. The Institute of Medicine and several state legislatures have recommended the use of patient safety event reporting systems (PSRS) to better understand and improve safety hazards. Numerous healthcare providers have adopted these systems, which provide a framework for healthcare provlder staff to report patient safety events. Public databases like MAUDE and VAERS have also been created to collect and trend safety events across healthcare systems. A patient safety event (PSE) report generally consists of both structured and unstructured data elements. Structured data are pre-defined, fixed fields that solicit specific information about the event. The unstructured data fields generally include a free text field where the reporter can enter a text description of the event. The text descriptions are often a rich data source in that the reporter ls not constrained to limited categories or selection options and is able to freely descrlbe the details of the event. The goal of this project is to develop novel statistical methods to analyze unstructured text like patient safety event reports arising in healthcare, which can lead to significant improvements to patient safety and enable timely intervention strategies. We address three problems: (a) Building realistic and meaningful baseline models for near misses, and detecting systematic deterioration of adverse outcomes relative to such baselines; (b) Understanding critical factors that lead to near misses & quantifying severity of outcomes; and (c) ldentifylng document groups of interest. We will use novel statistical approaches that combine Natural Language Processing with Statistical Process Monitoring, Statistical Networks Analysis, and Spatio-temporal Modeling to build a generalizable toolbox that can address these issues in healthcare. An important advantage of our research team is the involvement of healthcare domain experts and access to frontline staff, and we will leverage this strength to develop our algorithms. A key feature of our work is the generalizability of our methods, which will be applicable to biomedical documents arising across a remarkable variety of areas, such as patient safety and equipment malfunction reports, electronic health records, adverse drug or vaccine reports, etc. We will also release open source software via R packages & GitHub, which will enable healthcare staff and researchers to execute our methods on their datasets. Estimates of preventable adverse events in healthcare are staggering, despite the frequently cited Institute of Medicine (IOM) report that first brought attention to the problem over ten years ago. Identifying temporal trends and patterns in the data is particularly important to improving patient safety and patient care. Using our algorithms to effectively analyze documents from reporting systems has the potential to dramatically improve the safety and quality of care by exposing possible weaknesses in the care process.",Collaborative Research: Statistical algorithms for anomaly detection and patterns recognition in patient care and safety event reports,10211805,R01LM013309,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment Malfunction', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interest Group', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Report (document)', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'hazard', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'spatiotemporal', 'structured data', 'trend', 'unstructured data']",NLM,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2020,278731,0.01739732940858268
"Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events The frequency of diagnostic errors in emergency departments (ED) is largely unknown but likely to be significant. There is a compelling need to create measurement methods that provide diagnostic safety data to clinicians and leaders who in turn can act upon these data to prevent diagnostic harm. Electronic trigger (e- trigger) tools mine vast amounts of clinical and administrative data to identify signals for likely adverse events and have demonstrated capability to identify diagnostic errors. Such tools are more efficient and effective than other methods and can reduce the number of records requiring human review to those at highest risk of harm.  In prior work, we used rules-based e-trigger algorithms to identify patterns of care suggestive of missed or delayed diagnoses in primary care and inpatient settings. For instance, a clinic visit followed several days later by an unplanned hospitalization could be indicative of potential problems with the diagnostic process at the clinic visit. We also proposed a knowledge discovery framework, the Safer Dx Trigger Tools Framework, to enable health care organizations (HCOs) to develop and implement e-trigger tools to measure diagnostic errors using comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) data. Review and analysis of these cases can uncover safety concerns and provide information on diagnostic process breakdowns and related contributory factors, which in turn could generate learning and feedback for improvement purposes.  Sophisticated techniques from machine learning (ML) and data science could help inform ‘second generation’ e-trigger algorithms that better identify diagnostic errors and/or harm than rules-based e-triggers that require substantial manual effort and chart reviews. In contrast to rules-based systems, ML techniques could help learn from examples and accurately retrieve charts with diagnostic error without the need for “hand crafting” of an e-trigger. We will apply e-triggers to comprehensive EHRs that contain longitudinal patient care data (progress notes, tests, referrals) that provide an extensive picture of patients’ diagnostic journeys. Using national VA data, including data from 9 million veterans, and data from Geisinger health system, a pioneer HCO that serves approximately 3 million patients, we propose the following aims: Aim 1 – To develop, refine, test, and apply Safer Dx e-triggers to enable detection, measurement, and learning from diagnostic errors in diverse emergency department (ED) settings. We will calculate the frequency of diagnostic errors in the ED based on these e-triggers and describe the burden of preventable diagnostic harm. Aim 2 - To explore machine learning techniques that yield robust, accurate models to predict diagnostic errors using EHR-enriched data derived from expert-labeled patient records containing diagnostic errors (from Aim 1).  To our knowledge this is the first ML application in diagnostic error measurement, which could help scale up expert-driven e-trigger development and refinement. Newly developed e-triggers can be pilot tested and implemented at other HCOs, enabling them to create actionable safety-related insights from digital data. Narrative The process of making a diagnosis in emergency departments can be vulnerable to error. To study the risks involved, we will develop strategies to better identify electronic medical records of patients who may have had a diagnostic error in their care. We will test the use of human-derived rule-based algorithms and data-driven machine learning methods that can more accurately and efficiently identify these medical records than other currently available methods used in measurement of patient safety.",Application of a Machine Learning to Enhance e-Triggers to Detect and Learn from Diagnostic Safety Events,10018015,R01HS027363,[' '],AHRQ,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,498859,-0.004194929555654217
"Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices Judicious antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine is important because improper antimicrobial use can contribute to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens, which makes subsequent use of these drugs less effective in both human and veterinary medicine. There is very little on-the-ground information about veterinary clinicians’ antimicrobial use (AMU) practices in companion animal practice in the US. veterinary medicine. To improve our understanding of antimicrobial use in dogs and cats, we propose to create a nationwide digital surveillance system to collect critical AMU data using existing electronic practice information management systems (PIMS) in collaboration with veterinary industry partners. The system will automatically harvest AMU and patient data from digital PIMS. The proposed system will harvest data collected in routine veterinary examinations from existing PIMS systems and therefore will not require any additional effort from practitioners to participate in the program. Natural language processing, a machine learning method used to classify unstructured text, will be used to review electronic medical records to determine patients’ diagnosis. We aim to prototype the system in our native digital PIMS at North Carolina State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine Teaching hospital. We will then enroll additional private veterinary practices, including general practice, specialty hospitals, and emergency clinics, as sentinels and collect the same detailed PIMS data from a more representative set of clinics. Working closely with the sentinel clinics will provide a deep understanding of how our system operates in private clinics, and in the final stage we aim to expand the fully automated system to PIMS nationwide. The combination of sentinel clinics with the nationwide survey of clinics will create a powerful broad and deep surveillance system for antimicrobial use in veterinary clinics. A broad suite of AMU parameters will be estimated from this data, and the results reported to the FDA in an annual report. Additionally, we will share the data with other researchers through an web-based portal and GitHub repositories. This system will provide the critical data and analysis to understand veterinary AMU in the US. NARRATIVE Veterinarians play a central role in protecting animal and human health by preserving the efficacy of the antibiotics that their use for their patients. We have created a partnership among a public university, private veterinary hospitals, and a leading industry partner to collect information on how antibiotics are being used in cat and dog practices across the country with no disruption to the participating hospitals.

"Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 5-10% of hospitalized patients suffer significant clinical deterioration after admission, resulting in either transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) or a ""code"" event (i.e., cardiac or pulmonary arrest). Delayed identification of these events result in increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, existing prediction models result in multiple false alarms for every true positive alarm that they generate. In addition with every passing year, new monitoring systems are introduced that generate more false alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue which has been associated with patient deaths. The objective of this mentored career development proposal is to develop and assess novel computational algorithms that can predict the clinical deterioration of hospitalized patients earlier and more accurately than clinicians or conventional early warning systems, thereby allowing for timely intervention. Building upon our experience in the hematologic malignancy subpopulation of hospitalized patients, this new effort: 1) provides a foundation upon which to combine newer machine learning (ML) methods and clinical informatics to improve the capabilities of the model for an individual patient or specific subgroup; 2) assesses the impact and value of different variables from the electronic medical record (EMR) as part of the predictive model; and 3) broadens the evaluation of this approach to additional real-world patient populations, enabling insight into the translation of the models to clinical usage. The specific aims of this project are thus: Specific Aims Aim 1 To identify and extract model variables (features) from the EMR, evaluating different feature selection  methods to optimize different predictive criterion and their impact on ML algorithms. Aim 2 To develop an ML approach that handles multiple asynchronous data streams of longitudinal  information from the EMR, providing predictions on clinical deterioration in real-time. Aim 3 To explore clinician and rapid response team responses to early prediction of clinical deterioration. With successful completion of this proposal, the prediction model will be integrated into the EMR system. Future direction as part of a R01 proposal will involve external validation at other institutions and assessment of clinical impact on patient care. Relevance to Public Health Clinical deterioration in the hospital is often unexpected and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, with the CDC reporting 17.2 million hospital admissions through the emergency department in 2010 suggesting that approximately 1 million people annually are at risk of clinical deterioration during their hospitalization. Existing early warning systems have not been able to accurately predict these events without creating an overwhelming amount of additional false positive alarms, resulting in alarm fatigue and potential harm. Our project, utilizing machine learning techniques with the large amount of available clinical data, will serve to develop a predictive model that can predict clinical deterioration earlier with a higher positive predictive value than current algorithms/models which, when implemented, will be able to provide hospitalized patients with an additional safety net.",Prediction of Clinical Deterioration Using a Bayesian Belief System,9999034,K01LM012873,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Belief System', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'burnout', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'data streams', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'safety net', 'skills']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2020,205524,0.008456246845376115
"Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS Project Summary Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions to date. They are, however, pharmaceutical products that carry risks. Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine- preventable illnesses. The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains up to 30,000 reports per year over the past 25 years. VAERS reports include both structured data (e.g., vaccination date, first onset date, age, and gender) and unstructured narratives that often provide detailed clinical information about the clinical events and the temporal relationship of the series of event occurrences post vaccination. The structured data only provide one onsite date whereas temporal information of the sequence of events post vaccination is contained in the unstructured narratives. Current status –While structured data in the VAERS are widely used, the narratives are generally ignored because of the challenges inherent in working with unstructured data. Without these narratives, potentially valuable information is lost. Goals - In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Specifically, built upon the state-of-art ontology and natural language processing technologies, we will develop and validate a Temporal Information Modeling, Extraction and Reasoning system for Vaccine data (TIMER-V), which will automatically extract post-vaccination events and their temporal relationships from VAERS reports, semantically infer temporal relations, and integrate the exacted unstructured data with the structured data. Furthermore, we will provide and maintain a publicly available data access interface to query the new integrated data repository, which will facilitate vaccine safety research, casual inference, and other temporal related discovery. We will also develop and validate models to predict severe AEs using the co-occurrence or temporal patterns of the series of AEs post vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make use of the unstructured narratives in the VAERS reports to facilitate the temporal related discovery to a broad community of investigators in pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, vaccine safety research, among others. Project Narrative Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine-preventable illnesses. In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. Currently the FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) only includes one onsite date in its database. The textual narratives in the reports are generally ignored primarily due to their unstructured nature. These narratives, however, contain more detailed information about the series of events that happened after vaccination, which could be valuable for more informed clinical studies. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs.

"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records. By going beyond BMD, the fracture risk prediction tool developed by this work aims to significantly improve clinical fracture risk assessment and substantially impact the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture,9886227,R01AR074958,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomechanics', 'Blinded', 'Bone Density', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip Fractures', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive treatment', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'bone', 'bone strength', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'diagnostic screening', 'ductile', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fracture risk', 'high risk', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromuscular', 'older patient', 'patient health information', 'screening', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'standing height', 'theories', 'tool']",NIAMS,"O.

"Clinical Text Automatic De-Identification to Support Large Scale Data Reuse and Sharing The adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is growing at a fast pace in the U.S., and this growth results in very large quantities of patient clinical data becoming available in electronic format with tremendous potential but an equally large concern for patient confidentiality breaches. Secondary use of clinical data is essential to fulfill the potential for high quality healthcare, improved healthcare management, and effective clinical research. NIH expects that larger research projects share their research data in a way that protects the confidentiality of research subjects. De-identification of patient data has been proposed as a solution to both facilitate secondary use of clinical data and protect patient data confidentiality. The majority of clinical data found in the EHR is represented as narrative text clinical notes, and de-identification of clinical text is a tedious and costly manual endeavor. Automated approaches based on Natural Language Processing have been implemented and evaluated, allowing for higher accuracy and much faster de- identification than manual approaches. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to advance a text de-identification system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the research infrastructure at our implementation and testing site (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC), and ready for commercialization efforts. To accomplish this undertaking, we will focus on the following specific aims and related objectives, while continuing to prepare the commercialization of the integrated system, with detailed market analysis, commercial roadmap development, and modern media communication: 1) Enhance the text de-identification system performance, scalability, and quality to produce an enterprise-grade solution ready for deployment; 2) Enable use of structured data for enhanced text de-identification (when structured PII is available) and for complete patient records de-identification (i.e., records combining structured and unstructured data). This aim also includes implementing “one-way” pseudo-identifier cryptographic hashing to enable securely linking already de-identified patient records; 3) Integrate the text de-identification system with a research data capture and management system. This includes implementation of the de-identification system as a secure web service, with standards-based access and integration. This de-identification system has potential commercial applications in clinical research and in healthcare settings. It will improve access to richer, more detailed, and more accurate clinical data (in clinical text) for clinical researchers. It will ease research data sharing (as expected for larger NIH-funded research projects) and help healthcare organizations protect patient data confidentiality. Significant time-savings will also be offered, with a process at least 200-1000 times faster than manual de-identification. The adoption of Electronic Health Record systems is growing at a fast pace in the U.S., and this growth results in very large quantities of patient clinical data becoming available in electronic format, with tremendous potential, but also equally growing concern for patient confidentiality breaches. De-identification of patient data has been proposed as a solution to both facilitate secondary uses of clinical data and protect patient data confidentiality. This project will advance a text de-identification system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable and robust system allowing for complete patient records de-identification, integrated in the research infrastructure at our implementation and testing site and ready for commercialization efforts. It will improve access to richer, more detailed, and more accurate clinical data for clinical researchers, ease research data sharing and help healthcare organizations protect patient data confidentiality. !",Clinical Text Automatic De-Identification to Support Large Scale Data Reuse and Sharing,9908962,R42GM116479,"['Adoption', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communications Media', 'Confidentiality of Patient Information', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Funding', 'Growth', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Improve Access', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Data Privacy', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personally Identifiable Information', 'Phase', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Subjects', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Site', 'South Carolina', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'base', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cryptography', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'health care quality', 'health care service organization', 'health care settings', 'health management', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'prototype', 'software development', 'standard measure', 'structured data', 'systems research', 'unstructured data', 'web services']",NIGMS,"CLINACUITY,INC.",R42,2020,759330,-0.03315959184682816
"Improving Ethical Care for Patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) Most Americans do not have advance directives or appointed surrogates to guide their medical care in the event that they lose the capacity to make decisions for themselves. Healthcare teams are sometimes able to identify “default” surrogates, i.e., family or friends who can provide information about the patient's values, goals, preferences, and beliefs. However, a growing number of patients become decisionally incapacitated without any advance directives, appointed surrogates, or default surrogates, which leaves them vulnerable to receiving care that is unaligned with these tenets. Currently there is almost no data describing the prevalence of patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) or how clinical decisions are made for them. The proposed study will address this gap with two specific aims.  In Aim 1 we will determine (1a) what are the prevalence and characteristics of adults who are INEADS or at risk of becoming INEADS, and (1b) how clinical decisions are currently made for patients who are INEADS. For this aim we will retrospectively review electronic health records from an acute care database of ~40,000 hospitalizations and a home healthcare care database of ~89,000 community dwelling patients using a combination of structured data, natural language processing, and content analysis to answer the following questions: (i) What is the prevalence of patients who are currently INEADS and at risk of becoming INEADS in acute care and homecare settings; (ii) Who are the hospital and community personnel and policies involved, (iii) How do patient characteristics and diagnoses influence decisions, and (iv) What is the timeline for making decisions and how expeditiously are decisions reached?  In Aim 2 we will qualitatively explore the phenomenon of INEADS from clinical and patient perspectives. For this aim we will conduct: (1) focus groups with hospital- and community-based healthcare providers and hospital ethics boards, and (2) interviews with community-dwelling patients at risk of becoming INEADS. Sample questions to be explored include (i) What are the barriers and facilitators to formalizing and standardizing the clinical decision-making process for INEADS patients, and (ii) What are the barriers and facilitators to completing advance directives and designating surrogate decision makers among patients at risk of becoming INEADS?  The long-term goal of this project is to provide vulnerable INEADS patients with ethical care that is concordant with their goals and preferences. Knowledge gained from this pilot will inform (1) an intervention study to increase advance directive completion and surrogate designation among patients at risk of becoming INEADS, (2) the development, implementation, and evaluation of formalized decision-making processes for INEADS patients, and (3) the design, delivery, and testing of clinician education on best practices for caring for INEADS patients and patients at risk of becoming INEADS. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The majority of Americans do not have advance directives or healthcare proxies, and more adults are living independently without the support of family or friends. As a result, patients who lose the ability to make healthcare decisions for themselves may not have any voice in deciding what types of treatments they will receive. This study will investigate (1) how many patients in the hospital and community have no advance directives, surrogate decision makers, or ability to make decisions for themselves, and (2) how clinical teams make decisions for these patients.",Improving Ethical Care for Patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS),10038963,R21NR019319,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'Advocate', 'American', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Bioethics', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospital Ethics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Independent Living', 'Institutional Policy', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Team', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Update', 'Voice', 'Work', 'acute care', 'base', 'care preference', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'court', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'family support', 'high risk', 'improved', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prevent', 'programs', 'social', 'structured data', 'surrogate decision maker']",NINR,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2020,284481,0.0037759376198238763
"Collaborative Research: Statistical Algorithms for Anomaly Detection and Patterns Recognition in Patient Care and Safety Event Reports Project Summary Medical errors have been shown to be the third leading cause of death in the United States. The Institute of Medicine and several state legislatures have recommended the use of patient safety event reporting systems (PSRS) to better understand and improve safety hazards. A patient safety event (PSE) report generally consists of both structured and unstructured data elements. Structured data are pre-defined, fixed fields that solicit specific information about the event. The unstructured data fields generally include a free text field where the reporter can enter a text description of the event. The text descriptions are often a rich data source in that the reporter is not constrained to limited categories or selection options and is able to freely describe the details of the event. The goal of this project is to develop novel statistical methods to analyze unstructured text like patient safety event reports arising in healthcare, which can lead to significant improvements to patient safety and enable timely intervention strategies. We address three problems: (a) Building realistic and meaningful baseline models for near misses, and detecting systematic deterioration of adverse outcomes relative to such baselines; (b) Understanding critical factors that lead to near misses & quantifying severity of outcomes; and (c) Identifying document groups of interest. We will use novel statistical approaches that combine Natural Language Processing with Statistical Process Monitoring, Statistical Networks Analysis, and Spatio-temporal Modeling to build a generalizable toolbox that can address these issues in healthcare. We will also release open source software via R packages & GitHub, which will enable healthcare staff and researchers to execute our methods on their datasets. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased patient volumes and increased patient acuity, leading to an excessive burden on many healthcare facilities across the United States. This greatly increases the risk of patient safety consequences arising from malfunctioning medical equipment or adverse reaction to medication. To ensure patient safety and the highest quality of healthcare during this crisis, we need a rapid response system to model and analyze COVID-specific safety issues at scale, and quickly disseminate the results to healthcare facilities, so that these risks can be mitigated at the point of care. In this supplement, we propose to do this by (a) mining public databases and EHRs to identify devices/medication being used for treating COVID and (b) applying our methods (based on NLP, SPC, and SPM) to understand risks associated with these items. This information will be disseminated nationally to all healthcare facilities so that it can be integrated into the EHR at the point of care to alert clinicians. Project Narrative Estimates of preventable adverse events in healthcare are staggering, and the risk is particularly high for COVID patients due to the rapidly increasing burden on healthcare facilities. Using our algorithms to identify temporal trends and analyze free text narratives from reporting systems can ensure the safety and quality of care for COVID patients by exposing and mitigating possible weaknesses in the care process.",Collaborative Research: Statistical Algorithms for Anomaly Detection and Patterns Recognition in Patient Care and Safety Event Reports,10254593,R01LM013309,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'English Language', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Equipment Malfunction', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interest Group', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Records', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Site', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'cluster computing', 'coronavirus disease', 'dosage', 'hazard', 'health care quality', 'health care service', 'health care service organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'point of care', 'response', 'service delivery', 'spatiotemporal', 'structured data', 'trend', 'unstructured data']",NLM,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2020,74963,0.002742589682172893
"Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK Abstract Thousands of medical researchers around the world use VTK —the Visualization Toolkit— an open-source, freely available software development toolkit providing advanced 3D interactive visualization, image processing and data analysis algorithms. They either use VTK directly in their in-house research applications or indirectly via one of the multitude of medical image analysis and bioinformatics applications that is built using VTK: Osirix, 3D Slicer, BioImageXD, MedINRIA, SCIRun, ParaView, and others. Furthermore, VTK also provides 3D visualizations for clinical applications such as BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system and Zimmer’s prosthesis design and evaluation platform. VTK has been downloaded many hundreds of thousands of times since its initial release in 1993. Considering its broad distribution and prevalent use, it can be argued that VTK has had a greater impact on medical research, and patient care, than any other open-source visualization package.  This proposal is in response to the multitude of requests we have been receiving from the VTK medical community. The aims are as follows:  1. Aim 1: Adaptive visualization framework: Produce an integrated framework that supports  visualization applications that balance server-side and client-side processing depending on data size,  analysis requirements, and the user platform (e.g., phone, tablet, or GPU-enabled desktop).  2. Aim 2: Integrated, interactive applications: Extend VTK to support a diversity of programming  paradigms ranging from C++ to JavaScript to Python and associated tools such as Jupyter Notebooks,  integrating with emerging technologies such as deep learning technologies.  3. Aim 3: Advanced rendering, including AR/VR: Target shader-based rendering systems and AR/VR  libraries that achieve high frame rates with minimal latency for ubiquitous applications that combine  low-cost, portable devices such as phones, ultrasound transducers, and other biometric sensors for  visually monitoring, guiding, and delivering advanced healthcare.  4. Aim 4: Infrastructure, Outreach, and Validation: Engage the VTK community and the proposed  External Advisory Board during the creation and assessment of the proposed work and corresponding  modern, digital documentation in the form of videos and interactive web-based content. Project Narrative The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software library for the interactive display and processing of medical images. It is being used in most major medical imaging research applications, e.g., 3D Slicer and Osirix, and in several commercial medical applications, e.g., BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system. VTK development began in 1993 and since then an extensive community of users and developers has grown around it. However, the rapid advancement of cloud computing, GPU hardware, deep learning algorithms, and VR/AR systems require corresponding advances in VTK so that the research and products that depend on VTK continue to deliver leading edge healthcare technologies. With the proposed updates, not only will existing applications continue to provide advanced healthcare, but new, innovative medical applications will also be inspired.",Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK,9910382,R01EB014955,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biometry', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Publications', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virtual and Augmented reality', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cloud based', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'digital', 'health care delivery', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'open source', 'outreach', 'point of care', 'portability', 'processing speed', 'real world application', 'response', 'sensor', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'synergism', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'trend', 'web services']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2020,510157,0.0017092731287371085
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9869048,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,595773,-0.015646714548010938
"Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes PROJECT SUMMARY The advent of surgery to treat congenital heart disease (CHD) in the second half of the 20th century shifted the care paradigm from palliation of disease fatal in infancy to management of lifelong chronic disease through adulthood. There are now more than 1.5 million adults with CHD living in the United States. These patients have a substantial burden of cardiovascular and other medical comorbidities, as well as markedly increased risk for adverse outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, and premature death. The emergence of this population requires new clinical care models as well as the development of novel research tools and infrastructures to address these patients' unique characteristics and healthcare needs. Adult CHD is characterized by substantial complexity, era-dependent heterogeneity in treatment strategies, and time-varying implications of lifelong disease. This burgeoning population is understudied, and the pathophysiology of the component diseases remains incompletely understood. Billing and other administrative codes available in the electronic medical record are neither sensitive nor specific for CHD diagnosis and do not adequately describe many other salient clinical features. As a result, structured data in large administrative databases are not well suited to studying adults with CHD, even when the goal is simply to identify a cohort of patients with a given diagnosis. This constitutes a major impediment to research efforts and is the primary barrier underlying the limited population-based research performed to date. Adult CHD investigation would benefit immensely from methods to establish harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets. While billing codes are inadequate, the information needed to accurately classify adults with CHD is already available in the electronic medical record in the form of clinical notes, comprised mainly of unstructured (“free”) text. Manual data extraction is laborious, resource intensive, and, therefore, not scalable. We propose to apply cutting-edge natural language processing approaches to unstructured text in the electronic medical record to develop computable classifiers for variables fundamental to the study of adults with CHD. We will use two unique institutional data resources at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital that are already populated with expert-adjudicated labels to train classifiers for key phenotypes that are poorly defined by administrative codes. These classifiers will be validated in an independent patient cohort at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and tested in new disease-specific risk prediction models. This work promises to accelerate CHD research by massively increasing the scale of the patient cohorts that can be studied and by establishing a foundation for improved evidence-based decision support for this underserved population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Administrative billing codes are inadequate to support research for adults with congenital heart disease, a growing but understudied population with a high burden of medical comorbidities. To advance high quality research towards much-needed innovations in clinical care for these patients, we plan to develop novel methods for the creation of harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets that will expand and enhance collaborative research efforts.",Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes,9946462,R01HL151604,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Heart Septal Defects', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Eisenmenger Complex', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Nomenclature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transposition of Great Vessels', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'administrative database', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'large-scale database', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliation', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,784220,0.012007942742435693
"CPS: AutoWean: Foundations of Autonomous Medical CPS for Mechanical Ventilation Weaning   While mechanical ventilators provide life-saving respiratory support, prolonged acute mechanical ventilation (PAMV) can lead to severe complications (e.g. , pneumonia) and increased healthcare costs - predicted to be over $32 billion in 2020 and accounting for over 10% of all hospital costs. Thus, mechanical ventilation needs to be discontinued as early as possible, often by using a process known as ""weaning"". However, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy, where estimated 170,000 preventable deaths per year in US intensive care units are a result of inappropriate ventilator weaning. Consequently, the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) lists improper ventilator settings as a Top 10 Health Technology Hazard in 2019.  Autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning exemplifies a medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) that requires collections of interconnected medical devices (e.g., ventilators and patient monitors) that are coordinated for treating a patient (i.e. , performing safe autonomous weaning). This proposal aims to develop fundamental advances in safe and effective data-driven context-aware human-in-the-loop control that will enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning . While closed-loop control and data-driven techniques (e.g., system identification and machine learning) have been applied to MCPS, assuring the safety and reliability of using data-driven components that adapt in-the-loop with a human operator remains a challenge. We will demonstrate the impact of our closed-loop design and analysis techniques in autonomous MCPS for mechanical ventilation weaning .  The proposed project directly aligns with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) through the research and development of new technologies to advance medical care through medical device interoperability and clinical decision support for enabling autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning. Also relevant to the NIBIB mission, achieving the aims of this project requires a multidisciplinary approach and complementary advances in computer science and clinical care. From the healthcare perspective, this project will offer evidence-based and personalized decision support to caregivers for better mechanical ventilation weaning. The long-term impact of autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning pain will lead to shorter hospital stays, reduce the economic burden of health care, and reduce the deadly side effects of inappropriate weaning. This project concerns development of technologies to quantify and enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning , where, currently, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy.

"Transforming Patient Safety Event Data into Actionable Insights through Advanced Analytics Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to develop an innovative algorithms and a software tool to reduce the burden of safety event report classification and analysis so that report data can be transformed to actionable insights. Making safety event data more actionable will support the proactive identification of safety hazards before patients are harmed. We will achieve our research objective through (1) the development of natural language processing algorithms to classify safety event reports into actionable medication error categories; (2) the development of prototype software that will automatically categorize and visualize safety event reports to support trend identification; and (3) the pilot testing of prototype software with hospital and patient safety organization safety analysts. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, including computer science, specifically regarding information retrieval and data classification. Our research team includes patient safety organizations and collaboration with the computer science department at Georgetown University. The proposal is directly aligned with AHRQ’s priority area of making health care safer. Contributions from this research will include an expansion of our understanding of natural language processing and its application to categorizing clinical text, advances in visual analytics, and the development of a software tool to support patient safety analysts. The outputs of this research will serve both healthcare organizations and patient safety organizations allowing them to more efficiently and effectively analyze safety report data. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health because it applies human factors and computer science to develop software to improve the analysis of patient safety event report data to reduce safety hazards and prevent patient harm. Patient safety event report data will be analyzed using natural language processing algorithms to more efficiently classify events into error categories. Based on these algorithms, prototype software will be developed, tested, and disseminated with the goal of automatic categorization and visualization of safety event reports to identify important safety hazards.",Transforming Patient Safety Event Data into Actionable Insights through Advanced Analytics,9962801,R01HS026481,[' '],AHRQ,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,398080,0.01977203926430208
"Maternal Morbidity and Mortality: Risk Factors, Early Detection and Personalized Intervention PROJECT ABSTRACT  In the U.S., from 2011 to 2014, 7,208 maternal fatalities, with the trend worsening year-on-year (CDC, 2016). In addition to the 700+ fatalities, at least 50,000 woman experienced life-threatening complications, annually. According to CDC (2019) for every fatality, 70 more women suffer avoidable, traumatic complications as a result of pregnancy.  Medstar Health Research Institute and Invaryant, Inc, propose the evaluation of a cardiac risk assessment tool for pregnant and postpartum women; this tool updates automatically directly from patient medical records; wearable devices; and patient surveys. Success implies disruptive improvement in women's health. Proposed research involves three key elements: technology, data, and social determinants of health (SDOH) using geospatial mapping of patient locations. Technology: Study technology shall be based on the Invaryant Health Platform (IHP), a technology that automatically ingests data, from medical records, wearable devices, and other sources using proprietary AI based interoperability technology called Mesh-Complex Method Exchange (Mesh-CMX). We propose using the IHP in conjunction with novel prototype-level technology, namely Healthy Outcomes for all Pregnancy Experiences-Cardiovascular-risk Assessment Technology (HOPE-CAT) and the Invaryant machine learning technologies to monitor the patient, based on signals, out-of-range “trip-wires”, and trends in the mother's health data that merit medical intervention. By extending the proof of concept into an early commercial version of the software, and integrating it to the IHP which will automatically update changes in the patient's medical record, we will provide an “early warning” system for mothers and their providers. Data: The study will be tested on patients' medical records using the MedStar's Analytics Platform (MAP), a registry of over 5 Million unique patients. The tool will subsequently have the potential to be leveraged to over 90 million medical records for the MedStar and Cerner hospital systems, distilled down to meet specific eligibility criteria including, gender, age, race, pregnancy and medical outcomes. A second phase of this project would take the findings from the retrospective study (this grant request) and use the technology within the Medstar hospital system, to validate the efficacy of the findings in a “real-world setting”. Using our proprietary AI technology, we will compare each mother's progress against a cohort of retrospective data to enhance diagnostics and provide real-time feedback to caregivers and patients. Geospatial mapping: Mapping the patient medical record and the health information to their social setting is vital for understanding the underlying social constructs that affect the health of mothers in different regions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medstar Health Research Institute and Invaryant, Inc. propose the evaluation of a cardiovascular risk assessment tool (HOPE-CAT) for pregnant and postpartum women utilizing technology, data, and social determinants of health (SDoH) with geospatial mapping. HOPE- CAT, in conjunction with Invaryant's health platform and machine learning technologies, will monitor the patient based on signals, out-of-range ""trip-wires"", and trends in health data. HOPE-CAT will be validated on patient medical records using MedStar's Analytics Platform (MAP), a registry of over 5 million unique patients.","Maternal Morbidity and Mortality: Risk Factors, Early Detection and Personalized Intervention",10200448,UL1TR001409,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eclampsia', 'Elements', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Gender', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Experience', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Urban Population', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'data ingestion', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'health data', 'health of the mother', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'maternal morbidity', 'maternal risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'personalized intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'venous thromboembolism', 'wearable device']",NCATS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,UL1,2020,146537,0.00869791521225122
"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,10005116,P50AR070590,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Ohio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Provider', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'Records', 'Records Controls', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'multimodality', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'synergism', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIAMS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P50,2020,1316550,-0.0071610204278607995
"SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization A growing body of research has found that patients who actively manage their health have better outcomes, and patient engagement has become a central tenet in recent healthcare approaches. However, it has also been shown that many patients lack knowledge of their disease and medications, particularly as concerns chronic health conditions, whose exacerbation causes about two thirds of hospitalizations every year in the USA. Discharge instructions after hospitalization are a critical tool to engage patients in their self-care, but are often unsuccessful. Our hypothesis is that, to en9age patients at discharge, a personalized hospitalization summary should be provided, that integrates physician and nurse documentation, and is informed by the patient's level of engagement in self-care and their socio-cultural perspective. Our transformative pilot work on physician and nurse documentation has identified an additional obstacle to the effective flow of information from professionals to patients: vocabulary differences between physicians and nurses. By leveraging the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, we found no common synonyms between physician and nurse documentations for 75% of patients. Further, 86% of terms patients use are simple compared to only 15% for physicians. The lack of common language among patients, physicians and nurses motivates including all perspectives to make instructions meaningful for patients. Our hypothesis is that a better informed patient population who understands the connections between their illness, hospital experience, and discharge instructions will be more empowered and more engaged in their chronic disease management. Our innovation is to automatically create an easy-to-understand, personalized hospitalization summary that integrates events described in the EHR; and that is responsive to the patient's needs and preferences, and their activation framework (PAF) level. We pursue four specific aims: 1. To investigate socio-cultural patterns of patient perceptions of illness via a socio linguistic analysis of patient interviews; 2. To integrate multi-faceted information about a patient, as provided by physicians and nurses; 3a. To develop MyPHA, a novel application program, which will automatically generate the personalized summaries and deliver them to the patient on a tablet. MyPHA will be informed by aims 1 and 2, and will be grounded in Natural Language Generation technology; 3b. To evaluate MyPHA with multiple cycles of formative evaluation with all stakeholders, and a summative evaluation with patients. Whereas our pilot work has focused on heart failure, the techniques we will develop can easily be adapted to the management of other chronic health conditions, in particular for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. In addition, cancer and heart failure can co-occur, especially in older patients, and several cancer treatments can lead to the development of heart failure. The software program MyPHA will be released open source to the research community to enable rapid customization to other chronic conditions. Patients who are engaged in their self-care have better outcomes, however discharge instructions often fail to activate them. This study plans to integrate nurse and physician documentation from the Electronic Health Record with the patient's needs and preferences to provide patients with a concise summary of their hospitalization, tailored to their current activation level. This contextual information should help improve the lives of patients living with chronic health conditions, such as cancer patients and survivors.",SCH: INT: MyPHA: Automatically generating personalized accounts of in-patient hospitalization,9987573,R01CA225446,"['Adherence', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Chicago', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Libraries', 'Medical Records', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Participant', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'UMLS Metathesaurus', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer therapy', 'cardiogenesis', 'college', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health literacy', 'hospital readmission', 'illness perceptions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'older patient', 'open source', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'patient portal', 'preference', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'social', 'social culture', 'sociolinguistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'urban school']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,372633,-0.013632170112660373
"Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign Project Summary/Abstract Written The objective of the proposed research is to reduce the patient safety hazards associated with electronic medication administration records (eMARs) by, (1) understanding current usability and safety gaps, and (2) creating design and development documents, wireframes, and prototypes to serve as the foundation for future eMARs that will eliminate these gaps. In particular, we focus on communication and information flow challenges between nurses, pharmacists, and physicians during medication administration and use of the eMAR. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-16-009). We will develop a broad understanding of usability and safety hazards associated with eMARs by analyzing a large dataset of 1.7 million patient safety event reports and detailed medication error related narratives. We will then conduct heuristic analyses of current eMARs, and interviews and observations of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. These data will serve to inform the development of eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes as the foundation for future development. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health information technology (health IT), informatics, and data science. Our research team includes physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and human factors engineers, and experts in natural language processing. In addition, our partnerships include a patient safety organization and a health IT vendor. The proposal addresses fundamental aspects of the call for proposals by providing new insights on the safety of health IT and improves current practices by developing use cases and new prototypes for immediate use by healthIT vendors. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the role of health IT during medication administration with a focus on communication and information flow, design, development and testing documents for vendors and providers, and eMAR wireframes and prototypes to improve development. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with medication related test scenarios to assess current health IT systems. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health because it applies the sciences of human factors and informatics to improve the usability and safety of the electronic medication administration records (eMARs), which will ultimately improve patient care. Patient safety event report data will be analyzed to identify usability and safety hazards in eMARs, and interviews and observations will be conducted to identify clinician needs. Based on this knowledge eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes will be developed, tested, and disseminated with the goal of improving communication and information flow to reduce medication related errors.",Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign,9912124,R01HS025136,[' '],AHRQ,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,398492,0.02613460130521629
"Development and Validation of a Prediction Model to Address Physician Burnout PROJECT SUMMARY Professional burnout is a growing epidemic with symptoms affecting over 500,000 US physicians at any given time and carries significant adverse consequences for physician mental health, health care value, quality of care, and patient safety. There is an urgent need to develop reliable methods to proactively identify work environments at high risk for physician burnout, and tailor process improvements accordingly. The objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a real-time prediction model that uses operational data in primary care practices to identify high-risk clinics for physician burnout, enabling timely and tailored process improvements. The central hypothesis is that routinely-collected electronic health record (EHR) usage metrics coupled with practice-specific metrics can predict physicians’ risk for burnout and inform process improvement. The rationale for the proposed research is that early identification of high-risk clinics will allow organizations to tailor interventions to those clinics before burnout and its individual or health system consequences arise. This would be an innovative approach that prevents burnout rather than reacting to it. This project capitalizes on routinely-collect data from Stanford primary care clinics to create a database encompassing EHR usage metrics and practice-specific metrics. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Develop a prediction model to quantify risk for physician burnout. The working hypothesis is that real-time metrics of practice efficiency tracked by the EHR and other practice-specific metrics can predict physician burnout using a machine learning approach. Aim 2: Refine the prediction model using qualitative methods. The working hypothesis is that qualitative assessment will inform refinements to the prediction model created in Aim 1, and will demonstrate the face validity of the model. Aim 3: Validate the use of the prediction model to identify high-risk clinics. The working hypothesis is that quality of care metrics will demonstrate the concurrent validity, that subsequent routinely administered burnout surveys will demonstrate the predictive validity of the prediction model created in Aims 1 and 2, when aggregated at the clinic level. This proposal is significant because physician burnout is a growing problem with important implications for patient safety. It is also innovative in deploying machine learning and mixed methods to identify physicians at increased risk for burnout which will enable testing interventions to reverse this trend. In combination with formal training in quantitative and qualitative methods, expert mentorship, and participation in selected scholarly activities at Stanford, the experience gained through this project will facilitate progress toward a long-term goal to become an academic leader advancing evidence-based reform of the health care delivery system to optimize human factors that improve quality and safety. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an urgent need to develop reliable methods to proactively identify and improve work environments with high risk for physician burnout, and doing so will have broad public health relevance by reducing risk for burnout and its negative effects on quality and safety of care. Addressing physician burnout in primary care carries relevance for AHRQ’s priority populations of women, children, the elderly, and low-income patients, who are particularly dependent on high quality primary care. This project will support AHRQ’s mission of producing evidence to make health care safer and higher quality by developing and validating a prediction model to identify high-risk primary care clinics for physician burnout in order to 1) inform resource allocation to clinics with the highest need, 2) tailor process improvements to reduce risk for burnout and poor quality of care, and 3) lay the groundwork for expanding this model to other high-risk practice settings and provider types.",Development and Validation of a Prediction Model to Address Physician Burnout,10105225,K08HS027837,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,152582,-0.011458467734969885
"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,10020962,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,496734,0.019491694232708832
"Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project PROJECT SUMMARY Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are important in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a condition that affects 1.3 million Americans and is a leading cause of disability. Among chronic conditions, RA has many decades of robust scientific evidence around the validity of PROs. PROs are key outcome measures in RA clinical trials and studies, are responsive to therapy changes, are strong predictors of future disability and mortality, and play a central role in facilitating shared decision-making and treatment. Advances in health information technology (IT), like electronic health record-enabled Qualified Clinical Data Registries (QCDRs), provide an opportunity to scale and spread of use of PRO measures nationally. The Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) registry is a QCDR that was established in 2014 to improve the quality of care for patients seen in rheumatology practices. The RISE informatics platform aggregates electronic health record data from participating practices, analyzes these data centrally and feeds performance on quality measures back to clinicians using a web-based dashboard. RISE currently includes one the largest PRO measurement efforts for ambulatory patients with a chronic disease in the United States. However, as the registry matures, several critical gaps remain in our national PRO measurement efforts, including the lack of representation of public hospital systems and at-risk populations, the challenges faced by some practices in creating structured data fields in electronic health records to capture PRO measure scores, and the need to evaluate the impact of the PRO collection efforts through RISE. The overarching goal of this proposal is to systematically address each of these issues by 1) creating an evidence-based clinical learning network to support the participation of public hospital systems in PRO measurement and improvement efforts through RISE, 2) developing and scaling a natural language processing system to extract PRO measures from unstructured data in clinical notes, and 3) analyzing the impact of PRO measurement through RISE on quality of care and health outcomes in RA. This proposal builds on the novel informatics platform of the RISE registry to scale, spread and evaluate PRO implementation across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices, with the ultimate goal of improving functional status outcomes for those with RA. PROJECT NARRATIVE The RISE-PRO project aims to use the novel health IT platform of the RISE patient registry to scale, spread and evaluate the collection of patient-reported outcomes across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices. Collecting and using patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice has the potential to transform health care for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis by making care more patient-centered and by providing tools to facilitate shared decision-making, disease monitoring, and population health management.",Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project,9912121,R18HS025638,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R18,2020,493891,-0.0059917889635371655

The CAHPS V project will advance the AHRQ CAHPS mission of improving patients' experiences with health care by developing and evaluating strategies for survey measurement, reporting and quality improvement (QI). We propose a 5-year effort to advance the science and practice of patient experience assessment, continue innovation to ensure relevance to health service delivery and implement best survey practices, further the science of reporting, and evaluate CAHPS QI efforts. We will develop program communication strategies, and disseminate and promote use of CAHPS products. In particular, we will develop a survey to assess patient experiences with end-of-life care; develop new items to assess shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety; test alternatives to the standard CAHPS modes of data collection), explore the feasibility of administering a short-form survey dividing CG-CAHPS composites among respondents to reduce response burden, elicit stakeholder feedback about the value of different CAHPS supplement item sets, evaluate “The Your CAHPS Survey” that was designed to help users of the CAHPS surveys compile a survey tailed to their specific needs, and evaluate existing Spanish translations of CAHPS surveys. In addition, we will gather input from stakeholders on best practices for narrative data analysis, develop an approach for using automated Natural Language Processing for analyses of narratives, and construct an algorithm approach to select representative narratives that reflect and illustrate overall provider ratings. Finally, we will evaluate the contribution of patient narratives to quality improvement efforts in hospital care for children, characterize primary care practices use of the CG-CAHPS survey and patient-centered medical home items during PCMH transformation, assess the impact of pay- for-performance for care delivered by primary and specialty care safety net providers on CAHPS survey responses, explore the value of new shared decision-making, patient engagement, communication and patient safety items for QI and identify QI strategies that improve patient experience across various settings. We will also advance analytic methods for CAHPS data. The project team is well suited to achieving the study objectives given its prior accomplishments and established working relationships.

"VERITY: Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies. If properly addressed, these factors present tremendous opportunities for improving patient care and outcomes of patients. The overarching goal of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) CCCR is to facilitate advancements in the methodologic sciences supporting clinical research within the NIAMS pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) disease missions.  VERITY is organized around central scientific themes that can be applied to multiple rheumatic and MSK diseases. The Cores address the following cross-cutting areas: 1) including patients in clinical trial design, outcome selection, result interpretation, and dissemination; 2) integrating behavioral economics to enhance benefits of known interventions, i.e., adherence to medications, engagement in physical activity and weight loss; 3) extracting maximum information content from big data; 4) using smart technologies (mobile health) to advance clinical research; and 5) disseminating knowledge and mentoring of local and national rheumatic and MSK disease clinical researchers through distributed learning models. These scientific themes will be approached through several Cores described in the following Specific Aims. 1. To strategically direct, supervise, and provide financial accountability to VERITY and to train a broad group of local and national investigators for patient-oriented clinical research in pediatric and adult rheumatic and MSK diseases. (Administrative Core) 2. To develop and implement state of the art methods in innovative trials and longitudinal comparative effectiveness studies for rheumatic and MSK disease research. (Methodology Core) 3.

"Improving Hospital Efficiency: Predicting Post-Acute Care Facility Placement Using Machine Learning and Patient Mobility Scores from the Electronic Medical Record Project Summary / Abstract Annually, approximately 8 million people are discharged from an acute care hospital to a post-acute care facility, accounting for >20% of all hospital discharges and >40% of all Medicare discharges. Post-acute care facilities frequently provide rehabilitation services for patients experiencing functional limitations after acute illness who cannot return home safely. Clinicians in acute care hospitals often fail to recognize hospital- acquired functional limitations until after resolution of acute medical/surgical issues. This failure delays hospital discharge and the start of rehabilitation in a post-acute care facility, which can exacerbate hospital-associated functional limitations. Patients' mobility status, one component of physical function, is an important factor in determining the requirement for a post-acute care facility. Simple, validated tools for routinely evaluating patient mobility are increasingly common in acute hospitals but are not routinely used to predict the need for discharge to a post-acute care facility. One such tool, the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care Inpatient Mobility Short Form (AM-PAC IMSF), is a validated and reliable mobility measure for patients in acute care hospitals. The AM-PAC IMSF is used, as part of routine clinical care throughout hospitalization, for all patients in our acute care hospital. In a pilot study, we demonstrated that lower AM-PAC IMSF scores at hospital admission were strongly associated with post-acute care facility placement. Our goal is to expand upon our preliminary work to develop a formal model to predict which patients are likely to require post- acute care facility placement. Such prediction would be invaluable for improving the discharge planning process and expediting receipt of rehabilitation services at a post-acute care facility. Our overall objective is to demonstrate that prediction models, leveraging `big data' from electronic medical records, can help optimize the hospital discharge process. Thus, we propose the following Aims: 1) To determine if baseline patient mobility status, measured by the AM-PAC IMSF within 48 hours of hospital admission, is predictive of hospital discharge to specific levels of post-acute care; and 2) To develop a dynamic prediction model, using both the hospital admission AM-PAC IMSF score and the subsequent trajectory of daily scores after hospital admission, to predict hospital discharge to specific levels of post-acute care. This proposed research addresses the AHRQ priority of improved efficiency and quality of healthcare delivery via improving the hospital discharge process, with associated improvement in patient outcomes. Project Narrative We propose to use a validated and reliable mobility score, the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care Inpatient Mobility Short Form (AM-PAC IMSF), collected as part of routine clinical care, to develop static and dynamic prediction models, using classification trees (a machine learning method), that will help with early identification of patients needing discharge to a post-acute care facility. Earlier identification of patients likely needing post- acute care facility services during acute care hospitalization can reduce costly delays in discharge which, in turn, exacerbate patients' hospital-associated functional losses and disability. Leveraging `big data' from electronic medical records and the data-driven prediction models via this proposal can fundamentally improve current acute care hospital discharge coordination and planning, along with improving patients' functional outcomes.",Improving Hospital Efficiency: Predicting Post-Acute Care Facility Placement Using Machine Learning and Patient Mobility Scores from the Electronic Medical Record,10056338,R03HS027011,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,99860,-0.0038244658914413044
"Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with cancer experience significant side effects from their treatments, but these side effects are under- reported on clinical trials and no work has been done to improve the current system of side effect reporting. This study will create a new system of identifying and reporting side effects that is more accurate and efficient than the current system. The results of this research will provide clinicians, patients and their families with a true understanding of potential side effects of therapies used to treat childhood cancer.",Improving Adverse Event Reporting on Cooperative Oncology Group Trials,9994848,K07CA211956,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Acute leukemia', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Child', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncology Group', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'data pipeline', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'oncology trial', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K07,2020,169884,0.01888213648874968
