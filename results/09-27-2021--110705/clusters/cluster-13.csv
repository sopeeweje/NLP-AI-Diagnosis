"SCH: INT: VOLI: Voice Assistant for Quality of Life and Healthcare Improvement in Aging Populations   According to the latest US Census Bureau predictions, by 2035 older people are projected to outnumber children for the first time in US history. This brings significant societal challenges based on their unique living and health-related conditions stemming from reduced sensory, motor, and cognitive capabilities, as wen as multiple chronic conditions. We propose a personalized and context-aware voice-based digital assistant to improve the quality of life and the healthcare of older adults. VOLI will leverage the growing capabilities of existing technologies, such as mobile devices and smart speakers, and go well beyond the basics of weather reports, news services, and simple games, to provide more complex voice-based services and to focus on the healthcare domain with its many challenges and constraints. We will pursue three parallel research aims: 1) Our technical aim will investigate how digital assistants, natural language processing, and machine learning can produce meaningful health-related conversations by leveraging population- and patient-level data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs); 2) Our social, behavioral, and cognitive aim will focus on designing services for older adults based on their needs to support independence and investigate the acceptability of digital assistants for the aging population; and 3) Our clinical aim will investigate how digital assistants can detect new symptoms and correlate them with medication side effects and interactions, worsening of existing conditions, or onset of new illnesses. Using our VOLI voice-assistant, older adults will be able to get medication reminders and instructions based on prescriptions and clinical notes from EHRs, notify their family/caregiver about their well-being status, interact with their healthcare provider, request an Uber/Lyft car or other third-party services, engage in cognitive games, report symptoms as they occur throughout the day and over the counter medications they are taking, ask questions about symptoms and medications, and so on. VOLi integrates information from EHRs, clinical ontologies, and patient-level terminology. This work will be supported by innovations in natural language understanding, deep learning, and human-computer interfaces. Our work is guided by both clinicians and researchers in human-centered computing. Our team has a history of successful interdisciplinary work in healthcare, expert systems in clinical care, EHR integration, patient monitoring and self-report, ubiquitous computing, data analytics, and field studies. This research directly supports the mission of NIA by addressing the needs of older adults to be independent in their homes and to optimize their healthcare based on the context of their symptoms and medications. VOLI will also reduce caregiving burden and optimize the interactions with healthcare and service providers. The research can be extended to monitor recovery after surgery and reduce length of stay in the hospital, identify onset of new illness, or Identify when to refer a patient to hospice.",SCH: INT: VOLI: Voice Assistant for Quality of Life and Healthcare Improvement in Aging Populations  ,10017366,R56AG067393,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data Analytics', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Expert Systems', 'Family Caregiver', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Instruction', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Time', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Voice', 'Weather', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'care giving burden', 'clinical care', 'deep learning', 'design', 'electronic data', 'field study', 'handheld mobile device', 'hospice environment', 'human centered computing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent personal assistant', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'news', 'postoperative recovery', 'service providers', 'side effect', 'social', 'stem', 'ubiquitous computing']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R56,2019,299957,0.04603794943712889
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9727956,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Drug Screening', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Prescription opioid overdose', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'classification trees', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,588500,0.019345477272289417
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9739350,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2019,426737,0.02257389800181083
"Using existing data to understand and ameliorate risk in opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, leading to unprecedented levels of overdose deaths and other harms. Effective treatment for opioid use disorders is available, in the form of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine. However, there are significant questions about the risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization during and after treatment, and unplanned treatment cessation. What is the magnitude of these risks, and what patient, treatment setting, and provider factors may contribute to or protect against risk? Additionally, it is increasingly clear that more sophisticated approaches to patient assessment and treatment planning than are currently used are needed to minimise risk. We aim to: 1. Determine the magnitude of risk for specific adverse clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, hospitalization and ED presentation, and unplanned treatment cessation) during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; 2. Identify patient, treatment setting, and provider risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; and 3. Develop a risk prediction model to identify patients at greatest risk of adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT. To achieve these aims, this project will use existing population-based Australian data on OAT, linked to several health and criminal justice datasets to provide a rich understanding of treatment exposures and outcomes. These data will be used to inform strategies to guide the delivery of high-quality treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States. Specifically, the project will provide data about the magnitude of risk of adverse clinical outcomes during specific treatment and post-treatment periods, and identify patient, treatment setting and provider factors that influence risk. Additionally, it will use innovative machine learning techniques to demonstrate the potential for routinely collected data to be used to assess patient risk at point-of-care, allowing for the development of tailored treatment plans that minimize risk and maximize treatment retention.

"Vocal Pattern Detection of Late-Life Depression Late-life depression is a large public health problem that will only escalate with population aging in decades ahead. Depressive symptoms are well known to worsen symptoms of comorbid medical problems, pain and anxiety, causing a spiral of functional decline, disability, and loss of quality of life for older people. Rates of depression are higher among older adults who require health related assistance, including 38% of home health care, 23% of residential care, and 49% of nursing home care recipients. Despite its frequency, recognition of depression as a treatable condition is low. Innovative new approaches are needed to easily detect depression using objective markers that don't rely on subjective appraisals by older people, families, or providers. Vocal biomarkers of depression have been successfully identified in adults who are 65 years of age or younger, but no studies have examined if these methods may be applied with older people. This gap is significant because aging vocal qualities are confounded by changes associated with primary aging, sex differences, health conditions and medication use in older people. The purpose of this study is to identify vocal markers of late-life depression that will allow later development of individualized depression detection monitoring devices that overcome attitudinal barriers by providing objective biological information. Two specific study aims are to evaluate vocal patterns in older adults that are (1) distinct from and comparable to those identified for younger adults, and then (2) use machine learning to study and construct algorithms to predict depression. The observational, repeated measure design will enroll 250 participants aged 65 years and older from community settings. Audio recorded interviews will assess depression level using the PHQ-9, reading using the phonetically balanced Rainbow and Grandfather Passages, and free speech using a set of mood-neutral open-ended questions. Two interviews will be conducted for each participant using PHQ-9 scores to determine timing of follow-up interviews of either 2 weeks (PHQ-9 less than 10) or 8 weeks (PHQ-9 of 10 or greater). Interview segments will be separated using timestamps and vocal features will be extracted using openSMILE software. Each participant will serve as his/her own control in linear panel analysis. Support Vector Machine, Lasso regression, and K- means clustering will be used to predict presence and levels of depression based on PHQ-9 scores. Model performance will be assessed using the percent correcting predicted, false positive rate, and false negative rate. Outcomes from this study will guide additional research and the development of in- home monitoring and other devices that assure easy, objective identification of depressive symptoms that advance early, effective self-care approaches and treatments. Late-life depression interacts with other medical problems in a way that makes symptoms of all conditions more severe, leading to worsening health, loss of function and quality of life, and increasing disability. This devastating sequence may be avoided by identifying vocal biomarkers of depression that will hasten identification and treatment that averts unnecessary suffering. The goal of our study is to identify vocal patterns that are “biomarkers” of late-life depression so that easy-to-use monitoring systems and devices can be later developed to promote well-being and health.",Vocal Pattern Detection of Late-Life Depression,9656239,R15AG061755,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Communication', 'Home Care Services', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Nursing Informatics', 'Outcome Study', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residential Treatment', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Self Care', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Team Nursing', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'Work', 'aged', 'aging population', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'care recipients', 'community setting', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'geriatric depression', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'research and development', 'sex', 'skills', 'vocal cord', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R15,2019,463500,0.04614724932257722
"Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care Project Abstract The opioid epidemic is the U.S.'s most widespread behavioral public health problem, with a higher number of deaths due to drug overdose in 2016 compared to deaths due to HIV at the peak of the AIDS epidemic. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. However, only a fraction of persons with OUD access MAT, and treatment non-adherence and drop out is common. There is a dire need to improve systems to address these issues and to expand the use of MAT for many patients who are out of care. This R44 STTR application responds to RFA-DA-19-020, “HEAL Initiative: America's Startups and Small Businesses Build Technologies to Stop the Opioid Crisis.” It joins an outstanding scientific team at UCLA and a small business that has developed, Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) -- a software platform that by integrating with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) improves clinical management of patients by primary care providers (PCPs) treating patients with OUD using MAT. OARS platform uses a dashboard to show real-time measurement of patient achievements in recovery. It provides opportunities for patients to interact with their PCPs, allowing for better connection to and support from their PCPs. OARS platform features artificial intelligence to analyze information from the EHR and from patients to provide relapse risk assessment for patients receiving MAT for OUD, an innovation that sets OARS apart from other software solutions. The specific aim of Phase 1 of this STTR Fast Track proposal, is to modify the OARS platform for use in primary care settings by conducting interviews with PCPs (N=20) and their patients with OUD (N=40) in primary care settings to collect data on feasibility and acceptability of engaging with OARS to inform user- centered design of OARS. The specific aims of Phase 2 of this STTR Fast Track proposal are to: (1) employ a “stepped wedge” design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes across 6 treatment programs (N=200 treated patients) and (2) evaluate sustainability and return on investment of OARS implementation across 6 treatment programs. A commercialization plan documents progress to date for OARS platform and presents a market plan to improve both scale-up and quality of MAT services delivered by PCPs in primary care, which is a major contribution to addressing the ongoing opioid epidemic. ! Project Narrative With over 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017, of which 47,600 are attributable to opioid overdose, the opioid epidemic has become North America’s most widespread behavioral public health problem. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. The Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS), comprises of a healthcare team portal connected to a patient mobile application, to provide opioid related education, promote connectedness with clinicians, and track MAT treatment progress. This STTR Fast Track proposal will conduct interviews with patients that will inform optimal design of OARS and utilize a “stepped wedge” effectiveness design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes in primary care settings and evaluate sustainability and return on investment.",Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care,9912034,R42DA050398,"['Abstinence', 'Achievement', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer software', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'HIV', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'North America', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Suboxone', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'care providers', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'medical specialties', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mobile application', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'patient population', 'phase 2 testing', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse risk', 'scale up', 'social stigma', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'user centered design', 'waiver']",NIDA,"Q2I, LLC",R42,2019,225000,0.023990563657102327
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,9693819,R01NR016732,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Nursing', 'Research', 'Self Management', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain health', 'care costs', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'design', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health care delivery', 'health management', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'personalized intervention', 'physical conditioning', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smart home', 'social', 'technology validation', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'usability']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,356218,0.036278442850991514

"Systems Biology of Aging: Data-science meets Gero-science PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The funds requested in this R13 application are for partial support of “Systems Biology of Aging: Data-science meets Gero-science” annual meetings to be offered each August/September from 2019 through 2022 at The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine (JAX-GM) in Farmington, Connecticut. This meeting will bring together up to 150 interdisciplinary scientists including molecular biologists, immunologists, computational biologists, and geriatricians, who share a common interest in understanding aging and aging-associated disease at the systems level. Many aging-associated diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, are influenced by dysfunctions in the immune system. Recent advances in genomic profiling techniques (e.g., single cell transcriptomics) provide an opportunity to uncover aging-related changes in human cells/tissues and to link these changes to health and lifespan. The wealth and complexity of data produced using these technologies is ever increasing, as is the need to develop advanced computational methods to mine and integrate these data. Despite this need, there are currently no formal venues at which scientists, specifically those in the aging field, can be trained in the basics and application of data mining techniques (i.e., machine learning algorithms). Furthermore, current conferences on aging are not aimed at specifically bringing together computational biologists, immunologists and basic and clinical aging researchers. Therefore, the objectives of this meeting are: (1) to recognize and emphasize the highly interdisciplinary nature of the aging field and to promote and accelerate collaborations and cross-pollination of ideas across the three disciplines: aging, immunology, and computational biology; (2) to provide trainees (students and postdoctoral fellows) an opportunity to closely interact with, and gain feedback from, more senior investigators to advance their projects and establish connections to help build their careers; and (3) to provide an opportunity for researchers in the field of aging to learn the basics of machine learning techniques, which they will be able to immediately apply to their own research upon return to their home institutions. We will reach these objectives through carrying out the following Aims. In Aim 1, we will organize an interdisciplinary meeting and hands-on workshop focused on aging and aging-related diseases. The meeting will include a 2-day seminar session featuring talks by leading scientists, followed by a 1-day hands-on workshop on the basics of machine learning. In Aim 2, we will promote interactions to foster collaborative research and career advancement, including through a poster session. In Aim 3, we will recruit diverse attendees. Our proposed speaker list features several female scientists, and we will use our partnership networks to specifically recruit attendees from nationally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. The ultimate goal of the meeting is to advance the aging research field through expediting collaborations and the understanding of aging-related genomic data via application of advanced data mining approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Aging and aging-associated diseases, such as Alzheimer's, cancer and cardiovascular disease, represent a significant and growing health and economic burden, with the elderly population of the US projected to double by 2030. Herein, we propose to organize an interdisciplinary conference with a hands-on computational training component that will bring together scientists from the fields of aging, immunology, and computational biology, which will enable creative collaborations and train early career scientists in the aging research field on the basics of advanced computational techniques to mine aging-related genomic data. This is ultimately expected to lead to a better molecular understanding of the aging process and to novel approaches for the improvement of human healthspan and/or lifespan.",Systems Biology of Aging: Data-science meets Gero-science,9912317,R13AG064968,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Biology of Aging', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Career Mobility', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impaired cognition', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shock', 'Societies', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically significant', 'data mining', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'graduate student', 'health economics', 'healthspan', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'posters', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'senescence', 'skills', 'symposium', 'technology development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIA,JACKSON LABORATORY,R13,2019,38566,0.0010912872895518578
"Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Individual sleep disorders and characteristics are known to be associated with adverse health outcomes. However, few studies consider sleep in a multivariate context. Therefore, we propose a paradigmatic shift in sleep research towards sleep health. Conducting research through a sleep health lens can change health practice by clarifying which sleep characteristics are most important to treat, enhancing screening efforts, and facilitating the generalization of findings to all individuals, not just those with specific sleep disorders or complaints. Before achieving these long-term goals, however, the crucial first steps in the study of sleep health are to determine which sleep profiles predict health outcomes (Aim 1), and develop predictive algorithms that can identify individuals at risk of adverse health outcomes based on their sleep and other risk factors (Aim 2). These aims can only be achieved with an awareness of the statistical challenges related to the inherent multidimensionality of sleep health (e.g. multiple domains of sleep, multiple characteristics to represent each domain, multiple data sources, etc.). This multidimensionality generates substantial methodological barriers regarding variable and model selection and threatens researchers' abilities to develop transparent and reproducible models. In this R01, investigators will apply rigorous, sophisticated statistical methods to a large aggregated sample of adults aged >60 with self-report and polysomnographic characterization and over 10 years of longitudinal follow-up from three parent studies: Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study (MrOS), Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). In Aim 1, investigators will determine which multidimensional sleep profiles predict time to mortality in older adults using Cox-proportional hazards models, tree-structured survival analysis, and clustering. In Aim 2, investigators will develop powerful machine learning algorithms that incorporate sleep and other risk factors to identify which older adults have the greatest risk for early mortality. Within each aim, the impact of sex and race will be rigorously investigated, and models will be internally validated in independent samples to ensure reproducibility. The Secondary Aim is to investigate generalizability to studies with different demographic profiles and sleep protocols (Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, Honolulu Asia Aging Study of Sleep America) and different data types (sleep diary, actigraphy). All models will be developed in the context of other important known risk factors, including but not limited to age, gender, race, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and BMI. Findings from Aim 1 will jumpstart subsequent mechanistic research focused on sleep-related causal factors of mortality, leading to identification of targeted treatments for sleep problems that could reduce risk of mortality and morbidity. Findings from Aim 2 will provide important preliminary evidence for enhanced screening tools that can more accurately identify which individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project initiates a paradigmatic research shift by studying multivariate sleep health in older adults. Cutting- edge statistical methods will be applied to a large, multi-cohort sample, and replicability of findings will be rigorously investigated. Achieving the proposed aims will improve health practice by: (1) determining which multivariate sleep profiles predict mortality in older adults, thereby jumpstarting subsequent mechanistic research on sleep-related causal factors of mortality and targeted treatments to reduce mortality; and (2) suggesting prediction algorithms that incorporate sleep to enhance health screening for adverse health outcomes in older adults.",Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods,9722990,R01AG056331,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Americas', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Vision', 'Wakefulness', 'Well in self', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'diaries', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'health practice', 'improved', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prediction algorithm', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sex', 'sleep health', 'sleep pattern', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,260797,0.10361014305628423
"iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY The integrated research and training plans outlined in this K23 submission will prepare me for a career as a clinician-scientist conducting translational substance abuse research. My career goal is to perform hypothesis- driven original research investigations directed toward reducing morbidity and mortality from opioid overdose. In this proposal, I intend to deploy wearable biosensors (small devices that continuously record physiology) to study the effects of therapeutic administration of opioid analgesics. I have already studied wearable biosensors in individuals receiving opioids; my preliminary data demonstrates that opioid-tolerant individuals have different biometric signals than non-tolerant individuals. This observation suggests that biosensors can be used to identify the onset of tolerance, an important event that correlates with higher doses of opioid analgesics, and higher risk of death from opioid overdose. Biosensor data management and analysis requires signal processing, data analytic, and machine learning techniques; these approaches are beyond the areas of traditional medical training. My short-term goal is to utilize this K23 award to fill my knowledge gaps in wearable biosensing and advanced data analysis so that I can generate ever more innovative responses to the problem of opioid prescribing, tolerance, misuse, addiction, and overdose. To optimize this important line of investigation, I have developed a training plan that includes: 1) completing a PhD through the Millennium PhD program; 2) expanding my skills in wearable biosensing and behavioral health-based research; 3) developing an understanding of signal processing and machine learning; 4) developing data analytic and data science skills; and 5) expanding my research presentation and dissemination skills. I will achieve these goals through directed coursework, focused seminars, and practical experience. My mentorship team of expert investigators who will ensure my productivity and success includes E. Boyer (primary mentor), D. Smelson, J. Fang, and P. Indic (secondary mentors), and D. Ganesan (advisor) My research plan has three specific aims: 1) to deploy a wearable biosensor technology to detect digital biomarkers associated with the initiation of opioid analgesic therapy in an opioid naïve population; 2) to use signal-processing analytics to identify transitions in digital biomarkers with progressive opioid use and to identify individual characteristics associated with this transition; and, 3) to apply and explore supervised learning algorithms that can predict transitions in digital biomarkers that herald the onset of opioid tolerance. To identify dynamic patterns in response to opioids, I will study the digital biomarkers of opioid-naïve patients with acute fractures who are prescribed opioid analgesics. Results will be used to develop “big data” approaches to apply predictive algorithms to identify the onset of opioid tolerance. This work has the potential to prevent development of problematic opioid use and will provide the basis for subsequent R01 submissions to implement sensor-based interventions triggered by the onset of tolerance in individuals receiving opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to opioids (both prescription and illicit) has reached staggering proportions: more than half of individuals who currently abuse heroin report that opioid abuse began with a prescription opioid. Dr. Carreiro has demonstrated that wearable biosensors can discriminate between individuals who are naïve to the effects of opioids from those who are opioid tolerant, a characteristic that increases risk for opioid-related death. This career development award will provide her with the training to use of wearable biosensors to identify the onset of opioid tolerance and the expertise to reach her ultimate goal of developing tools to prevent opioid-related death and increase the safety of opioid prescribing.",iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals,9666315,K23DA045242,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug abuse', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heroin Abuse', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'career', 'comparative', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'digital', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opiate tolerance', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K23,2019,188575,0.02707481522102818
"Leveraging National Sleep Research Resource Data for Personalized Sleep Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY People vary in both the quantity and the quality of their sleep. Traditional sleep “stages” (for example, slow- wave sleep or REM sleep) can exhibit different neural correlates (as measured by electroencephalography, EEG) in different people and at different times during the night. Standard approaches for characterizing sleep (“staging”) do not take this variability into account, however. Here we suggest that attempts to use EEG and other data to infer sleep stages should in fact tackle the heterogeneity between and within individuals explicitly, to yield more accurate classification not just of an individual’s minute-by-minute sleep, but of the sleeper’s typical characteristics more generally. Quantitative, data-driven individual sleep profiles will be important prerequisites for emerging large-scale molecular genetics and other ‘omics studies of sleep, and for driving personalized sleep medicine more generally. Specifically, we propose to leverage more than ten thousand whole-night polysomnography (PSG) studies from the demographically diverse National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), in order to optimally apply machine-learning methods to sleep signals. Most importantly, the NSRR dataset will enable approaches that take the fundamental heterogeneity of sleep into account: this is a rate-limiting step that has not been tackled by previous approaches. We hypothesize that it is not the large training set per se, but rather the increased prospects for better-matched training data, combined with the methods developed here, that will be beneficial. To this end, we will build and disseminate a novel, multi-level automated sleep classifier based on the world’s largest dataset of sleep signals. PROJECT NARRATIVE People vary considerably not just in how much they sleep, but also in the types of sleep they typically have. Standard approaches to describing sleep, primarily developed in the 1960s, only partially capture this variability: we propose to use a range of measures, including brain activity, on over ten thousand sleeping individuals to generate more accurate, data-driven, personalized profiles of how a person's sleep varies over a night. Sleep factors are associated with multiple physical and neuropsychiatric illnesses, and so better measurement of the underlying processes will be critical for future genetic and biomarker studies aimed at understanding the links between sleep, health and disease.",Leveraging National Sleep Research Resource Data for Personalized Sleep Profiling,9687195,R01HL146339,"['Adult', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mythology', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Polysomnography', 'Process', 'Property', 'REM Sleep', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stage I Sleep', 'Stage II Sleep', 'Staging', 'Stretching', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'heuristics', 'implicit bias', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'molecular scale', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'open source', 'real world application', 'sleep health', 'sleep onset', 'tool', 'trait']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,451078,0.06852984656937043
"Using the Electronic Health Record to Identify and Promote Goals-of-Care Communication for Older Patients with Serious Illness Although discussions that address patients' goals of care are one of the most important aspects of palliative care, this communication is often lacking in our healthcare system. Goals-of-care communication is associated with improved patient and family outcomes and reduced intensity of care at the end of life. Electronic health records (EHR) provide a key opportunity to identify patients who would benefit from these discussions and to promote these discussions, yet prior interventions have not used the EHR for this purpose.  Older adults with chronic illness, and particularly those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), are especially vulnerable to inappropriately intensive end-of-life care. To address this shortcoming, we build on two of our most successful programs, one using the EHR to identify goals-of-care discussions and the other a novel intervention called Jumpstart that promotes and enhances these discussions. We will examine the effectiveness of the Jumpstart intervention for hospitalized older adults with chronic illness and specifically oversample those with ADRD to understand the effectiveness of the intervention in this key group.  We propose 2 linked, complementary randomized trials. Trial 1, a pragmatic trial, compares usual care with a clinician-facing Jumpstart for hospitalized older adults with serious illness (n=2000). Trial 2, a comparative effectiveness trial, compares this clinician-facing Jumpstart with a bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart based on surveys completed by patients or family members (n=400). We hypothesize that the clinician-facing Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to usual care, and the bi-directional, patient- specific Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart. We use an innovative hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach to accomplish 3 aims. Aim 1 evaluates the effectiveness of the clinician-facing Jumpstart, compared with usual care, for improving quality of care; the primary outcome is EHR documentation of a goals-of-care discussion during the hospitalization. Secondary outcomes include intensity of care at the end of life. Aim 2 evaluates the effectiveness of the bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart; the primary outcome is the same as Trial 1. We will examine the same secondary outcomes, but also include patient- and family-reported outcomes assessed by surveys at 1 and 3 months after randomization including occurrence and quality of goals-of-care communication in the hospital, goal-concordant care, psychological symptoms, quality of life, and palliative care needs. We will also examine costs of care after accounting for costs of the interventions. In Aim 3, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation to explore barriers and facilitators to future implementation and dissemination.  Our team has experience conducting innovative multi-center trials with patient-centered outcomes, economic analyses, and implementation science. This novel hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach addresses key knowledge gaps to improve the quality and value of care for older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Communication about goals of care is one of the most important aspects of palliative care for older adults, yet the lack of this communication is a major shortcoming in our healthcare system. We propose 2 linked and innovative randomized trials to evaluate a novel intervention that promotes and enhances goals-of-care discussions for hospitalized patients with serious chronic illness. We hypothesize the intervention will improve outcomes for older patients with chronic illness and their family members and will be effective in the expanding subset of these patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.",Using the Electronic Health Record to Identify and Promote Goals-of-Care Communication for Older Patients with Serious Illness,9708591,R01AG062441,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic Visits', 'Communication', 'Consensus', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'base', 'care costs', 'care outcomes', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention cost', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older patient', 'palliative', 'patient subsets', 'patient-clinician communication', 'pragmatic trial', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychological symptom', 'randomized trial', 'secondary outcome', 'symposium', 'treatment as usual', 'trial comparing']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,777399,0.04095534282848757
"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood. In a more globally connected and computerized world, older adults may constitute particular at-risk targets for highly effective forms of online financial fraud, such as through social engineering in the form of emails containing malicious links or attachments (phishing). Susceptibility to financial deception in aging has been investigated primarily in the context of age-related cognitive decline, while socioemotional and neurophysiological parameters have been largely understudied. Further, there are few effective approaches to characterize, monitor and detect, and eventually prevent, financial deception. The objectives of the proposed research are threefold: Aim 1 will determine financial deception risk across the adult life span. This aim will seek to confirm that age is associated with greater susceptibility to financial deception, online and in person. Aim 2 will characterize cognitive, socioemotional, and neurophysiological mechanisms associated with deception risk. Specifically, this aim will uncover the extent to which cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction, age-related dampening in neurophysiological reactivity, and structural and functional brain changes contribute to increased susceptibility in aging. Aim 3 involves the development and psychometric validation of a novel risk assessment interview and the development of an automated deception warning tool to alert older adults about potential online fraud. Our research design will span three data collection phases comprising healthy young, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old individuals. Leveraging infrastructure developed in our lab, a behavioral field experiment will determine real-life susceptibility to financial fraud via simulated phishing email attacks (Phase I). A comprehensive in-lab assessment of cognitive/socioemotional and neurophysiological mechanisms will follow (Phase II and III, respectively). A data-analytic Phase IV will integrate data collected across Phases I-III using statistical and machine-learning methods. This multidisciplinary approach, encompassing psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering will lay the foundation for building an integrated approach to risk detection and the provision of financial decision-making supports in older adulthood. Findings and methodologies developed as part of this project have the potential to inform real-life decision-supportive interventions that adopt an age-targeted approach towards the long-term goal of financial risk reduction in older individuals. Project Narrative A rapidly aging population means that financial deception of the aged is an emerging public health problem that requires surveillance and intervention.

"Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] needed for older adults to maintain optimal physical function is unknown. Institute of Medicine and Endocrine Society have publicly debated on 20 ng/mL or 30 ng/mL, respectively, as targets for skeletal health, but both groups agree that stronger evidence is needed to identify target concentrations for extra-skeletal outcomes, e.g., falls and physical function. The problem is significant: >25% of older adults have poor physical function, 50% have 25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and 30 ng/mL. Identifying 25(OH)D targets for older adults will have immediate impact by informing design and analysis of vitamin D supplementation trials. Namely, targets serve as inclusion/exclusion criteria or baseline subgroups and as secondary outcomes. Our solution is to empirically identify and validate sex-specific (possibly stratified by other factors; e.g., race, genetic variants) 25(OH)D targets in older adults (= 65 years) related to lowe risk of falls and better physical function using existing NIH-funded datasets. A critical challenge is that 25(OH)D cannot be randomized; therefore observational data are a crucial part of the solution. Conventional statistical methods are ill-equipped for this problem; thus, we will develop novel statistical methods by adapting and refining structural modeling and machine-learning methods, and apply them to our aims. We will carry out the aims using 4 prospective cohort studies comprising >12,500 older adults: Health, Aging, and Body Composition, Invecchiare in Chianti, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. We will: 1) identify and validate 25(OH)D targets for falls reduction, mobility, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living (functional outcomes); and gait speed, muscle strength, and frailty (proximal conditions) (aim 1); 2) characterize the joint impact of 25(OH)D and serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations on functional outcomes/proximal conditions (aim 2); and 3) quantify mediation of 25(OH)D on functional outcomes/proximal conditions by endocrine and metabolic factors (PTH, serum alkaline phosphatase, aklotho, fibroblast growth factor 23) (aim 3). We will write code in SAS and R statistical languages and disseminate it to the scientific community for use in additional research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aging of the population is expected to lead to an increased burden of poor physical function and loss of independence. Low concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are common in older adults and may be one reason for deficits in physical function. Since 25(OH)D can easily be increased by sunlight exposure, diet, and supplements; identifying and validating a target 25(OH)D for functional outcomes in older adults can have a significant impact on public health.",Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults,9701092,R01AG048069,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Body mass index', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gait speed', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Living', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intake', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'PTH gene', 'Phosphorus', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Sun Exposure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Woman', 'Writing', 'analytical method', 'bone', 'bone health', 'calcium intake', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic variant', 'improved mobility', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sarcopenia', 'secondary analysis', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'skeletal', 'ultraviolet']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2019,320457,0.08859277000093538
"Enhanced Measurement and Modeling of Sleep Electrophysiology to Better Understand Sleep Disparities Project Summary Health disparities associated with race and ethnicity are a major public health issue in the United States. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that differences in people's quality and quantity of sleep may account for part of this problem. Here we wish to study patterns of sleep, using full polysomnography data in a large and diverse cohort, to better understand what causes some individuals and groups to differ in their typical sleep, and to link this variation in sleep to relevant health outcomes. In order to study sleep as a mediator of health disparities associated with race/ethnicity, we propose to first unpack the “sleep” term into profiles of quantitative traits (Aim 1). Second, we will test for demographic moderators of the associations between race/ethnicity and sleep traits, which can point to likely socioeconomic and social/environmental contextual mediators (Aim 2). Finally, we will demonstrate the relevance of these findings by testing for association with health outcomes – primarily cardiovascular disease risk and measures of allostatic load – and estimating the extent to which sleep accounts for racial/ethnic health disparities (Aim 3). We will apply a targeted array of data-driven analytic methods, from data science, machine learning, computational neuroscience and causal modeling, to characterize individual differences in patterns of sleep. A more nuanced understanding of what constitutes “poor sleep” is important because different aspects of sleep are likely to have qualitatively different links to demographic and biomedical factors, including age, sex, lifestyle factors, inherited genetic makeup, circadian rhythms, medication effects and current state of physical and mental health. By disentangling this network of inter-related variables, we will be better positioned to understand – and ameliorate – the effects of the numerous factors that can induce racial/ethnic disparities in sleep, and consequently, in health too. Project Narrative Health disparities associated with race and ethnicity are a major public health issue in the United States. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that differences in people’s quality and quantity of sleep may account for part of this problem.

"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging (Alzheimer's Disease Supplement to 1R01AG057764-01A1) Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood. In a more globally connected and computerized world, older adults may constitute particular at-risk targets for highly effective forms of online financial fraud, such as through social engineering in the form of emails containing malicious links or attachments (phishing). Susceptibility to financial deception in aging has been investigated primarily in the context of age-related cognitive decline, while socioemotional and neurophysiological parameters have been largely understudied. Further, there are few effective approaches to characterize, monitor and detect, and eventually prevent, financial deception. The objectives of the proposed research are threefold: Aim 1 will determine financial deception risk across the adult life span. This aim will seek to confirm that age is associated with greater susceptibility to financial deception, online and in person. Aim 2 will characterize cognitive, socioemotional, and neurophysiological mechanisms associated with deception risk. Specifically, this aim will uncover the extent to which cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction, age-related dampening in neurophysiological reactivity, and structural and functional brain changes contribute to increased susceptibility in aging. Aim 3 involves the development and psychometric validation of a novel risk assessment interview and the development of an automated deception warning tool to alert older adults about potential online fraud. Our research design will span three data collection phases comprising healthy young, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old individuals. Leveraging infrastructure developed in our lab, a behavioral field experiment will determine real-life susceptibility to financial fraud via simulated phishing email attacks (Phase I). A comprehensive in-lab assessment of cognitive/socioemotional and neurophysiological mechanisms will follow (Phase II and III, respectively). A data-analytic Phase IV will integrate data collected across Phases I-III using statistical and machine-learning methods. This multidisciplinary approach, encompassing psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering will lay the foundation for building an integrated approach to risk detection and the provision of financial decision-making supports in older adulthood. Findings and methodologies developed as part of this project have the potential to inform real-life decision-supportive interventions that adopt an age-targeted approach towards the long-term goal of financial risk reduction in older individuals. Project Narrative A rapidly aging population means that financial deception of the aged is an emerging public health problem that requires surveillance and intervention. An increasingly common form of financial fraud is conducted online as older adults more and more manage their assets online.

"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease, their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults with who are at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and the reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines.

"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9696812,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,388353,0.1019244195124014

"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9416993,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'nonmedical use', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,537201,0.012641549366951565
"Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of the proposed K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to provide the PI with the mentorship, theoretical knowledge, and research skills to develop into a fully independent psychophysiological researcher studying biomarkers of depression that can be used as targets for novel interventions. In consultation with her mentors, the PI has recruited a team of expert consultants to guide her in executing a research project and training plan that will provide experience essential to her goals.  The proposed study will be conducted at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry. The study focuses on late-life depression because it is prevalent and has negative outcomes. Existing treatments have low response rates and are rarely used correctly in the community due to their complexity. The project is based on the premise that focused treatments targeting biosignatures of specific neural abnormalities will have the greatest impact on clinical outcomes in late-life depression. It concentrates on positive valence systems, which are vulnerable to aging and often impaired in depression. The project will investigate positive valence systems in older adults with major depression receiving Engage, a psychotherapy designed to reactivate reward system functions. Engage has been found efficacious in late-life depression and easy to learn by community-based therapists. Consistent with RDoC methods, the proposed study will examine target engagement of Engage in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) during a 9-week course of Engage therapy, using three units of analysis to assess positive valence system function: physiology (event-related potentials), self-reports, and behavior. It will compare Engage-treated participants with 35 depressed participants, group-matched on age, receiving manualized supportive therapy. Additional analyses will assess whether low baseline positive valence function, or increases in positive valence function during treatment, predict improvement of anhedonia with Engage, and whether reward function mediates change in anhedonia.  The proposed training plan complements the research study with individualized tutorials, formal coursework, research collaborations, and manuscript preparation that will provide the PI with knowledge and skills in several areas: 1) Age-related neurobiological changes in the positive valence system and related networks; 2) Advanced statistical techniques to identify distinct neural abnormalities in depressed individuals based on their ERP profiles; and 3) Clinical trial design for psychotherapeutic interventions. The proposed project may provide important information about target engagement and mechanisms of a biologically informed, easily implemented treatment for late-life depression that has potential for dissemination. It will also provide pilot data for an R-series study using machine learning methods to predict response to Engage and will serve as an important stepping-stone for the PI as she prepares for an independent research career. Late-life depression is prevalent and devastating, and response rates to even the most effective treatments are low. Outcomes may be improved by developing targeted interventions such as Engage – a new, easily disseminated, neurobiologically informed psychotherapy for late-life depression designed to restore impaired function of the positive valence system. The proposed study will use event-related potentials and a panel of other positive valence system measures to assess target engagement in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) receiving Engage therapy, with a comparison group of 35 age-group-matched depressed peers receiving supportive therapy.",Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression,9734172,K23MH116105,"['Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuscripts', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Neurobiology', 'Opioid user', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positive Valence', 'Preparation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Stimulus', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Visual attention', 'age group', 'age related', 'base', 'biosignature', 'career', 'career development', 'comparison group', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'extrastriate', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'peer', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'sustained attention', 'trait']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2019,190488,0.03161612857846827
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9567908,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'care outcomes', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2019,1747167,0.01619579242279408
"A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research Summary/Abstract This project will construct a Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (IPUMS-MLP) of unprecedented scale and scope. Using cutting-edge automatic record linkage technology and drawing on complete count U.S. census data available from IPUMS for the period 1850 to 1940, the project will construct millions of individual life histories and trace millions of families over multiple generations. This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,9769604,R01AG057679,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Big Data', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Demographic Transitions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Genealogy', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immigration', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Mission', 'Names', 'Neighborhoods', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Process', 'Public Policy', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Social Processes', 'Social Security', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Urbanization', 'War', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive capacity', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'economic outcome', 'experience', 'health economics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'life history', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,681232,-0.0003934001384400128
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,9750581,R01AG059729,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Diet', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Freedom', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Preparation', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'ST14 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'biracial', 'caucasian American', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'disability', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fitness', 'healthy aging', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'male', 'mental state', 'microbial', 'middle age', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sarcopenia', 'walking speed', 'young adult']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,559078,0.02294027440639492
"The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India Project Summary/Abstract Evidence demonstrates that sleep deprivation causes impaired cognitive function and is associated with impaired health (e.g. altered immune and cardiovascular function). Yet these conclusions largely derive from correlational relationships or studies of acute sleep deprivation lasting only a few days in sleep labs. Further, research on sleep in disadvantaged populations and sleep disparities is limited, despite severe environmental challenges to sleep among the poor. Moreover, the potentially bi-directional relationship between poor sleep and poor decision-making, a possible mediator of the income-health gradient, remains largely unexplored. In short, while poor sleep could be an important contributor to health disparities and accelerated aging, we know relatively little about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This K01 application will provide key training for career advancement and begin to close this gap in knowledge. To accomplish this goal, a randomized field experiment with 400 participants, each enrolled for over one month, in Chennai, India, will (1) objectively measure sleep and key environmental factors to provide preliminary evidence on the role of environmental causes of sleep deprivation in an urban environment, (2) rigorously evaluate two simple scalable interventions to reduce sleep deprivation among low-income adults in their natural environments, (3) estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision- making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, alcohol consumption), and earnings, and (4) utilizing questions regarding sleep asked of both RCT participants and a 50,000 person nationally-representative sample, estimate the extent of sleep deprivation and its impacts more broadly in urban India. The training aims underpinning the research aims and the applicant's long-term research goals are to expand knowledge and skills in: (1) cognitive psychology and the measurement of cognitive function, (2) aging, and (3) machine learning and predictive modeling. This training, accomplished through multiple avenues including coursework, directed study, and mentorship, will directly facilitate the proposed research and extend the scope and impact of the applicant's long-term research career studying health disparities and interactions between health and decision-making which may impact both cognitive and physical health as individuals age. Notably, while this application focuses on the impacts of sleep deprivation, the potential for health to shape decision-making is much broader. Constant exposure to other aspects of poor health associated with poverty, such as pain, also have the potential to exert a mental tax, leading to impaired cognition and poor decisions. Such a negative feedback loop between these factors and decision-making has the potential to further exacerbate health disparities. The far-reaching applicability of this idea beyond the direct scope of this proposal opens the door to high public-health significance through a wide variety of channels. Project narrative Although sleep has significant potential to impair cognition and impede health, relatively little is known about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This research will begin to close this gap in knowledge through a 400 person randomized trial in Chennai, India, which will objectively and rigorously measure sleep and key environmental factors impacting sleep, evaluate the impact of two simple and scalable interventions to improve sleep, and estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision-making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, tobacco consumption), and earnings. Providing rigorous evidence on these relationships and improving our collective understanding of the causes and costs to sleep deprivation, including not just direct health outcomes, but also shifts in preferences and decision-making directly relevant to health, will provide policy-relevant information important to improving health and healthy behaviors as well as promoting heathy and economically-secure aging.",The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India,9614849,K01AG055691,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Career Mobility', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Cost Measures', 'Decision Making', 'Developing Countries', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Economic Models', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impaired health', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Insecta', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolism', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Translating', 'adverse outcome', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure reduction', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cost', 'diarrheal disease', 'disadvantaged population', 'discount', 'econometrics', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'skills training', 'sleep health']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2019,127872,0.06178511820798691
"Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study ABSTRACT Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are all highly prevalent in the US population and are associated with significant morbidity, including poor mental health, impaired neurocognitive function, metabolic dysregulation, and cardiovascular disease. In the context of the high prevalence of pernicious sleep disturbances, there is evidence that sleep disparities exist in the population, such that racial/ethnic minorities – including Mexican-Americans – are at increased risk of sleep disturbances. This is alarming, since this group is also at increased risk for many of the adverse cardiometabolic and functional outcomes linked to sleep disturbances. These associations may be influenced by economic hardship, psychosocial stress, unhealthy behaviors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and smoking), and acculturation – the degree to which an individual adopts (in this case) traditional Mexican versus American culture. The first goal of this project is to examine sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep apnea severity among Mexican-Americans and examine the role of these social-behavioral factors in this relationship. Second, this study aims to examine the role of sleep and cardiometabolic disease risk in this population and explore the role of acculturation, psychosocial stress, economic hardship, and/or unhealthy behaviors in these associations. To accomplish this, this project will partner with the Mariposa Community Health Center, the federally qualified clinic in the Nogales, AZ area. Nogales is a small city on the US/Mexico border that is an ideal location for studying non-urban Mexican- Americans, as it is made up of 83% Hispanics/Latinos, 33% immigrants, and 77% who primarily speak Spanish at home. This community-engaged project will partner with Mariposa and their Platicamos Salud program that uses experienced Community Health Workers (promotoras de salud) to collect data and perform home visits. The study will recruit N=900 Mexican-Americans and N=200 Non-Hispanic Whites to complete a battery of assessments from a clinic visit (questionnaires, interviews, exam for anthropometry and arterial stiffness, and collection of biomarkers), a 1-night home sleep apnea assessment, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and a 2-week home monitoring period with sleep diary and actigraphy. This will result in a rich dataset that can help to identify and reduce sleep disparities in the population and point to potential intervention approaches to reducing cardiometabolic disease disparities. The analytic plan will take advantage of a machine-learning analytic approach, which will be used to evaluate the complex relationships among all of these variables. This project will address many relevant issues in sleep medicine, health disparities research, and border health. The partnership with Mariposa will enhance recruitment, promote research integrity (or ensure appropriateness of research methods), and facilitate dissemination of the study results into the community through education programs associated with Platicamos Salud and other community outreach efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The primary goal of this study is to assess sleep health among Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border, characterize relationships with cardiometabolic disease risk, and investigate the role of social-environmental factors including acculturation, stress, socioeconomics, and health behaviors. Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are highly prevalent in the population. These conditions are associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, daytime functioning problems, and poor mental health. Disparities in sleep health in racial/ethnic minorities exist, including Mexican-Americans. In particular, social-environmental factors at the US-Mexico border may play an important role in sleep health disparities. This project will not only allow for increased understanding of the complex relationship among sleep, health, and social-environmental pressures, but through a community partnership it can maximize our ability to reduce these disparities. Also, this project has the added benefit of providing information about the role of sleep as a potentially modifiable factor in cardiovascular disease and diabetes disparities as well.",Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study,9672598,R01MD011600,"['Acculturation', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Community Health Aides', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Hour', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Latino', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Metabolic', 'Mexican', 'Mexican Americans', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cardiometabolism', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'caucasian American', 'community partnership', 'diaries', 'diet and exercise', 'disorder risk', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'food security', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'low density lipoprotein triglyceride', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'perceived stress', 'pressure', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'sample collection', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep health', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,717643,0.05738016674926186
"Administrative Supplement for Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study ABSTRACT This application is in response to NOT-MD-19-023, which calls for proposals for expanding recruitment of projects to include Native Hawaiians / Other Pacific Islanders (NH/OPIs). Sleep disturbances, including short sleep duration, sleep apnea, and insomnia disorder, are highly prevalent among adults in the US and are associated with an increased risk for mental and physical health consequences including cardiometabolic disease. Comparative research studies indicate that sleep disparities are present in some minority populations; however, the extent to which sleep disparities exist across different racial/ethnic groups is not well known. Both Mexican-Americans and individuals from Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (NH/OPI) populations are at an increased risk for adverse sleep and corresponding cardiometabolic health outcomes, yet the role of potential mechanisms linking such deficiencies in these comparative minority groups is understudied. Factors that impact sleep functioning in one population may differentially impact another population. The overall goal of this project is to support and strengthen two aims of the parent grant by specifically including NH/OPI into the Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep study to further evaluate how acculturation, psychosocial stressors, and other social, environmental, and behavioral factors impact relationships between sleep disturbances and cardiometabolic disease risk similarly and uniquely, as compared to Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border. This project aims to determine how acculturation, economic hardship, psychosocial stress, and unhealthy behaviors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and smoking) are related to sleep disturbance by type in NH/OPI and in comparison to these relationships in Mexican-Americans. The second goal of this project is to determine how sleep and/or social-behavioral factors predict cardiometabolic disease risk among NH/OPI, as well as determine how these same factors are different in NH/OPI when compared to Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border. To accomplish these goals, this project will partner with researchers at the University of Hawaii to recruit and enroll N=100 NH/OPI to complete a battery of assessments from a clinic visit (questionnaires, interviews, exam for anthropometry, collection of biomarkers), a 1-night home sleep apnea assessment, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and a 2-week home monitoring period with sleep diary and actigraphy. Inclusion of NH/OPI into the larger dataset will facilitate a better understanding of sleep disturbances and the impact of factors that regulate sleep, including duration, insomnia symptoms, and obstructive sleep apnea, in relation to cardiometabolic disease risk within this population and in comparison to Mexican-Americans. The analytic plan will utilize a machine-learning analytic approach, which will be used to evaluate the complex relationships among all of these variables. This project will further address efforts at reducing sleep-cardiometabolic health disparities in minority populations by identifying potentially modifiable areas associated with community-based intervention programs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sleep disturbances are common and related to important health outcomes. This project expands the parent project by adding additional information regarding how sleep plays an important role in linking social/ environmental factors such as acculturation, stress, and health behaviors to cardiometabolic risk factors. Specifically, by expanding this project to include Native Hawaiians / Other Pacific Islanders, we can obtain new information about these relationships.",Administrative Supplement for Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study,9978525,R01MD011600,"['Acculturation', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinic Visits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Exclusion', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Hawaii', 'Hawaiian population', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mexican', 'Mexican Americans', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'base', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'comparative', 'design', 'diaries', 'diet and exercise', 'disorder risk', 'environmental stressor', 'ethnic identity', 'experience', 'food security', 'functional disability', 'health assessment', 'health disparity', 'intervention program', 'low density lipoprotein triglyceride', 'mortality', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'perceived stress', 'physical conditioning', 'psychosocial', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'sleep health', 'social', 'stressor']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,124869,0.06175217822713489
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9785384,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2019,158220,0.07221116368957328
"Improving patient and caregiver engagement through the application of data science methods to audio recorded clinic visits stored in personal health libraries PROJECT SUMMARY    Forty to eighty percent of clinic visit information is forgotten by patients immediately post visit, a significant  barrier to self-­management leading to poor health outcomes. Visit summaries can improve recall, yet patient  uptake is limited and clinicians report significant burden in creating summaries for laypeople. Patients are  beginning to audio record visits and clinics are now offering this service. When patients receive a clinic  recording, 71% listen and 68% share it with a caregiver, resulting in improved understanding and self-­ management. Yet, unstructured recordings are difficult to navigate. Personal health libraries (PHLs) may help

methods to securely analyze clinic visit recordings and make this information accessible and understandable  for patients;; and Aim 3 Demonstrate the usability and use of an Audio-­PHL in older adults with multimorbidity  and caregivers. Applicants hypothesize: (1) The Audio-­PHL will surpass acceptable usability metrics in older  adults and caregivers and (2) natural language processing (NLP) methods developed for the Audio-­PHL will  accurately identify key visit information (e.g. medication) and connect it to credible patient resources. The

"A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults Abstract  People aged 65+ will represent 21% of the U.S. population and increase to about 80 million by 2040, and the oldest old (age 85+) will number ~ 14.1 million. Population aging presents both opportunities and challenges for our healthcare, the economy, and existing social support systems. Many older adults especially the oldest old, minorities and those of lower Socio-Economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, poor diet, and decreased levels of physical activity each of which influence morbidity and mortality. Mobile-based, tablet-based, and in-home technologies provide an excellent opportunity for projecting behavior- change interventions and social support into the everyday life of older adults at great economies of scale. The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system, designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2) the Fittle+ mobile platform designed to support positive health behavior change through integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence (AI). The study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1 we will develop and pilot test the FSS with representative samples of older adults. Phase 2 will involve a two group randomized trial where participants will be randomized to the Fittle Senior System (FSS, an adaptive coaching and social support system using mobile technology) or to a paper-based psycho-educational (BPE) control condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at risk for social isolation (90 per condition - 30 White Caucasians, 30 Black/African Americans and 30 Hispanic Americans). We will recruit males and females commensurate to the gender proportions represented in this age group and work to ensure that we have sufficient representation from the “oldest old” cohort. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on clinically significant measures of health and health behaviors and indices of social support. We will also gather information on potential moderating (e.g., ethnicity, age) and mediating variables (e.g., health self-efficacy), which will be examined using multilevel modeling techniques guided by current theories of behavior change and technology acceptance and use among older adults. Project Narrative This proposed project is addressing a critical public concern. The population is aging and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are common among older adults especially ethnic minorities. This study will develop and evaluate a mobile technology-based intervention designed to support positive health behavior change among diverse older adults through integrated online social support, personalized coaching and goal setting.",A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults,9791132,R01AG053163,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caucasians', 'Chronic', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Industry', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Jordan', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Support System', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'active method', 'age group', 'aged', 'aging and technology', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinically significant', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'dynamic system', 'education research', 'efficacy trial', 'ethnic minority population', 'family structure', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'low socioeconomic status', 'male', 'medical schools', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'nutrition', 'programs', 'psychoeducational', 'psychoeducational intervention', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,587119,0.04272646449670042
"Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment This project will develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) to provide cognitive training, in the form of learning to play the piano, to improve cognitive functioning and reduce feelings of loneliness in socially-isolated older adults. The SAR will administer cognitive training via guided practice on a set of standard piano lesson tasks designed to reflect particular cognitive functions: memory, attention, language, and social acuity. The goals of this project are that the SAR will (1) engage the persons with mild cognitive impairment (PMCI) in skill-building cognitive music training; (2) enhance cognitive functioning, in particular verbal and visual memory, reasoning ability, and complex attention; and (3) reduce feelings of loneliness. This SAR can be used as both a personalized social companion and an interactive tutor to deliver customized training for cognitive functioning and social engagement. We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, roboticists, engineers, human factors specialists, neuroscientists, and gerontologists, well suited to achieve goals. Dementia is a costly chronic disease; an estimated $259 billion was spent in 2017 for health care, long-term care, and out-of-pocket expenses. Furthermore, social isolation is a problem many older adults face, with 1 in 3 older adults reporting loneliness in the United States. Socially assistive robotics (SARs) have the potential to provide mental and social engagement – especially for those older adults who may lack social connections. In particular, SARs can utilize machine learning to provide customized and socially-engaging cognitive training for lonely older adults with MCI.",Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,9980524,R42AG060800,"['Adoption', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Esthetics', 'Face', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Loneliness', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Music', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Reporting', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Specialist', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Uninsured Medical Expense', 'United States', 'aged', 'body language', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive training', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'preference', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'robot assistance', 'robot interface', 'sensory integration', 'skills', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'social engagement', 'tutoring', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'visual memory', 'web app']",NIA,APPLIED UNIVERSAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION,R42,2019,1999103,0.04557344156759812
"Multimorbidity and Treatment-Related Outcomes in Older Heart Failure Patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) is the most common reason for hospitalization in older adults. Over 85% of all patients hospitalized with HF are 65 years of age or older. Multimorbidity, typically defined as the presence of ≥2 chronic conditions, increases the risks of hospitalization and death in older HF patients, and greatly complicates the clinical management of HF. Caution is required in applying national clinical practice guidelines to the care of older adults with multimorbidity, as this could result in undesirable net effects and less than optimal outcomes including adverse interactions between drugs and various concomitant diseases. In response to PA-17-088 (Exploratory Analyses of Existing Cohorts, Data Sets, and Stored Biospecimens to Address Clinical Aging Research Questions, R01), we propose to leverage an existing HF cohort, including data for more than 100,000 patients with HF within the Cardiovascular Research Network between 2005-2012, with follow-up data up to 2017. We will extend our previous efforts by examining treatment patterns and the net benefits versus harms of selected therapies in older adults with HF and a wide spectrum of multimorbidity burden. We will further examine the benefits and adverse outcomes of various therapies focusing on particularly vulnerable subgroups of patients with HF afflicted by two prevalent conditions, anemia or diabetes. Our specific aims are: (1) to examine the effectiveness of selected medical therapies (renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system blockers, beta-blockers, diuretics, and aldosterone receptor blockers) on death, HF hospitalization, and all-cause hospitalizations in a large, community-based population of older adults with HF across a range of levels of multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction; (2) to evaluate targeted adverse outcomes, including kidney dysfunction, hyperkalemia, sodium disturbances, bradycardia, and syncope associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF, stratified by multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction status; and (3) to characterize the potential benefits and adverse outcomes associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF and two prevalent comorbidity dyads—HF- diabetes and HF-anemia—that are common and substantially increase the risks of death and morbidity. In addition, we will create novel, validated methods to identify adverse outcomes related to HF therapies from unstructured data in large electronic health record systems through natural language processing technology, along with employing state-of-the-art analytic approaches to evaluate treatment-related outcomes. In that our proposed investigation will take advantage of a large, geographically and demographically diverse cohort of adults with HF receiving care within community-based healthcare delivery systems, we anticipate our findings will be highly generalizable to the broad spectrum of older adults with HF managed in “real-world” practice settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The presence of multiple chronic conditions, or multimorbidity, in older adults with heart failure substantially increases the complexity of their care, and increases the risks of hospitalization and death.

"Modernizing the Assessment of Financial Decision Making: Development and Evaluation of a Simulated Online Money Management Task in Older Adults The advent of digital finance and online money management (OMM) services has changed the ways in which we conduct everyday transactions. Based on my preliminary F32 survey findings, the number of older adults who use technology is drastically growing and the way they approach financial transactions is certainly changing. Given the increasing number of older adults and corresponding diseases of aging such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the vulnerability of older adults to financial exploitation, and the pervasiveness of financial decision making in everyday life, it is critical to be able to accurately examine financial decision making using objective, quantifiable, and ecologically valid tasks that are in keeping with the current trends. In 2016, an expert panel working for the US Social Security Administration found a gap between the current assessment of financial decision making and real-world financial performance. The current proposal seeks to bridge this gap by developing and applying simulation technology-based OMM task to assess financial decision making in individuals across the spectrum of cognitive aging. Accordingly, the first two aims (K99/Mentored phase) of the current proposal are to establish the reliability and validity of a novel, simulated OMM credit card statement review task in cognitively healthy older adults via psychometrically rigorous approaches. The third and fourth inferential aims (R00 phase) are to use: (i) a longitudinal strategy to track OMM over time and in relation to cognitive changes in cognitively healthy older adults, and (ii) a cross-sectional strategy to examine OMM in two clinical groups (mild AD and those judged as financially incapable by Adult Protective Services) versus healthy older adults. To accomplish these aims, I will develop advanced skills to supplement my strong neuropsychological training, by: 1) gaining expertise in developing and conducting functional assessments using state-of-the-art technology; 2) developing a deeper knowledge of psychometric measurement to optimize task design; and 3) enriching my conceptual understanding of financial decision making while learning how to incorporate neuroeconomic principles and metacognitive assessment in financial decision making measurement. I have assembled an excellent and well-rounded mentorship team consisting of a computer scientist, biostatistician, gerontologist, economist, and expert neuropsychologists. Overall, this K99/R00 proposal enables me to lay a foundation for an independent research career focused on using technology to accurately conceptualize financial decision making in cognitively diverse older adults, a goal that is in line with the NIA’s mission to improve “the health, well-being, and independence of adults as they age”. Older adults, a wealthy segment of the population, are known to exhibit compromised financial decision making especially in the context of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease. As the landscape of financial decision making has changed dramatically with rapid technological advances, there is a growing gap between the skills necessary for everyday financial decision making and the way it in which it is assessed clinically. Given the precipitous, ongoing and projected increase in the number of older adults and their use of technology, it is imperative to develop financial decision making measures that approximate real world functioning in the current technological culture that can inform clinical determination of financial decision making abilities, and shape public policies aimed at minimizing financial losses.",Modernizing the Assessment of Financial Decision Making: Development and Evaluation of a Simulated Online Money Management Task in Older Adults,9721902,K99AG062783,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Factor Analysis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Psychologist', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Policy', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Review Literature', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States Social Security Administration', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Writing', 'age related', 'alertness', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive task', 'design', 'digital', 'executive function', 'exhaustion', 'financial decision making', 'financial exploitation', 'financial literacy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'literacy', 'middle age', 'neuroeconomics', 'novel', 'online course', 'preservation', 'rate of change', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2019,132543,0.0824442236464832
"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,9835697,R01DA048533,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental disorders', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'methamphetamine use', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'rural area', 'screening', 'treatment duration']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,735192,0.027353903553015375
"Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic PROJECT SUMMARY Up-to-date information about non-fatal overdose emergency department (ED) encounters can provide critical information about the evolution of the opioid epidemic and response of the healthcare system and is an essential to planning of clinical trials to address the problems underlying this epidemic. Establishing a platform that delivers high positive predictive value for opioid-related overdose (OD) using a combination of coded and natural language terms in electronic health records (EHRs) is an essential step toward the large-scale surveillance necessary to evaluate the pragmatic effectiveness of numerous systemic and policy-based efforts and to create the infrastructure for large scale trials to reduce drug-related mortality and morbidity. However, to date, localized and federal efforts have been largely based on discrete ICD-10 code data or have had time lags of one-to-three years for more detailed data. Perhaps more Importantly, they have not had the capacity for planning and feasibility assessment for clinical and translational research at specific sites. We propose foundational work to create an inter-institutional research database and network focused on patients presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD. To create this network, we will extend previous work to develop: (1) an e-phenotype for case identification in the ED based on EHR data, and (2) combine this with a data dictionary and coded data extraction tools, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, to obtain additional data from EHRs; tools for primary capture of data during clinical care; and tools for integration of data on social determinants of health. This will allow for a more thorough characterization of individuals presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD including: demographics, comorbidities, OD agent and source, intentionality of the OD, ED treatment and discharge disposition. Through refinement and automation, the data extraction process will be extended to a set of pilot CTSA Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) Network sites and then potentially to other CTSA's nation-wide. This new functionality focuses on providing a platform to accelerate research. To accomplish this work, our Specific Aims are to: 1) Demonstrate the feasibility of extending the ACT Network data model and infrastructure to monitor the opioid epidemic using ED data, 2) Create a prototype opioid overdose monitoring and response network across participating institutions and a toolkit for other CTSA sites to join the network, and 3) Demonstrate potential usefulness of the network in monitoring the opioid epidemic and in planning clinical trials. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective near real time means of monitoring opioid-related OD presentation in EDs across the country to inform point-of-care service delivery, prevention and treatment intervention development and evaluation. Downstream, the application of project deliverables include dissemination of the replication toolkit to leverage the platform of the CTSAs and NIDA Clinical Trials Network to build capacity for timely surveillance of opioid-related OD to facilitate prevention and treatment research and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients presenting with opioid-related overdose to hospital emergency departments represent a high-risk group for morbidity and mortality and a potential target for interventions to combat the opioid epidemic. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective inter-institutional research database and network focused on these patients.

"Real-time fMRI neurofeedback of large-scale network dynamics in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY The misuse of opioids, opioid addiction and overdose are a serious national public health crisis—the opioid epidemic—that despite increased scientific, clinical and government attention, continues to grow. Methadone is a generally effective treatment for opioid use disorder, however relapse rates remain high, and risk of overdose is greatest during relapse. There is a need for improved mechanistic understanding of the factors that contribute to opioid relapse to improve our understanding of opioid use disorder and its treatment. Using connectome-based methods (i.e., functional connectivity) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we recently identified a large-scale brain network that predicted opioid relapse from both resting and task states. Connectome-based methods enable data-driven characterization of whole brain networks related to behavior that might be better suited to describe complex clinical phenomena (e.g., opioid relapse). Building on prior work indicating the utility of real-time fMRI neurofeedback to test brain activation patterns related to specific functions and individual abilities to regulate these functions, the proposed project will use connectome-based neurofeedback to target patterns of functional connectivity within our recently identified “opioid abstinence network”. This information is critical to improve understanding of mechanisms of opioid relapse. Individuals on methadone will be randomized to receive either active (n=12) or sham (n=12) connectome-based neurofeedback at 3 weekly scanning sessions including feedback and transfer runs. Additional baseline and follow-up scans will include resting state and reward and cognitive task runs. Craving, negative affect and opioid use will be measured weekly and at 1-mo follow-up. Based on our pilot data, connectome-based feedback will be targeted at the opioid abstinence network and we hypothesize that increased connectivity in this network will be associated with improved clinical outcomes. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with reduced opioid use from baseline to follow-up scans (Aim 1a) and at 1-mo follow- up (Aim 1b). Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with increased opioid abstinence network connectivity in resting state (Aim 2a) and task (reward, cognitive) state (Aim 2b) versus sham feedback, as in our pilot work. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with greater improvements in clinical features of opioid use disorder (craving, negative affect) than sham feedback (Aim 3a) and that increased opioid abstinence network connectivity will correlate with these improvements (Aim 3b). Overall, this project tests a potentially transformative hypothesis relating large-scale brain network dynamics to outcomes in opioid use disorder, and tests a highly innovative method for real-time fMRI neurofeedback from the opioid abstinence network to improve clinical features of opioid use disorder. This project will provide unprecedented insight into the functional neurobiology of opioid relapse and more generally has the potential to transform existing real-time fMRI paradigms in addictions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project leverages advances in real-time fMRI neurofeedback and machine learning to test whether methadone-treated individuals with opioid use disorder can increase functional connectivity within an empirically-derived “opioid abstinence network” that has previously been identified to predict opioid relapse. This project will provide critical data and information to improve our understanding of opioid relapse and may transform existing real-time fMRI paradigms in addictions more generally.

"Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality Abstract Older adults struggle to engage in health enhancing physical activity (PA) and spend up to 11 hours a day sitting. Older women, in particular, are at increased risk of chronic disease and disability, and use a high proportion of healthcare resources. Improving both these behaviors has promise for improving several salient aging outcomes, but evidence to inform guidelines on how best to interrupt long periods of sedentary behavior (SB) are lacking. Few laboratory-based trials have included adults over 70 years old, have focused on PA to interrupt SB, and have not tested standing breaks that might be acceptable to older adults. A recent review showed that in the real world, traditional PA interventions do not meaningfully impact SB. In contrast, interventions that focus on standing can reduce SB, up to 2 hours per day. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between self-reported SB and increased risks of death and metabolic outcomes, but very few prospective studies have employed objective measures of SB. Although accelerometer measures can indicate the intensity of movement or lack of it, traditional cutpoints do not accurately classify behaviors such as sitting, standing or walking. While pilot intervention studies, using thigh worn inclinometers, have demonstrated that SB can be greatly reduced, there are no RCTs in older adults with health outcomes. There is much room for improvement in our understanding of SB and healthy aging. The National Institute on Aging conducted a summer workshop series to address this issue in 2013. We have therefore designed a Program project – Sedentary Time and Aging Research (STAR) – to provide more rigorous and comprehensive evidence on how to interrupt sitting time and the consequences for healthy aging. In particular, we are proposing a paradigm shift away from energy expenditure as the primary mechanism for health outcomes to investigating behaviors such as brief sit-to-stand transitions that expend little energy but engage muscles, improve postural blood flow, and may impact physical functioning in older adults. Further, we will study a broader range of outcomes than investigated to date, including targeted novel mechanisms important for healthy aging. The STAR program will include 3 Projects and 2 Cores for study of postmenopausal women at risk for chronic disease. STAR includes 2 randomized trials, in the laboratory (N=86) and in the real world (N=592), with focus on optimizing new computational techniques to apply to existing prospective accelerometer data (n>6000). All projects will investigate the consequences of extended sitting, standing, brief sit-to-stand transitions and PA breaks on mechanisms of healthy aging including glucose regulation, endothelial functioning, and mitochondrial functioning. We will also investigate physical functioning, blood pressure and in Project 3, 5-7 year mortality risk. All Projects will compare effects across age groups. STAR will provide a comprehensive evidence base that can inform public health guidelines on SB and aging. We will coordinate our efforts with a new American Heart Association Center on SB and Latinas.  Narrative Sitting time may be particularly bad for the health of older women. This program grant will provide new and improved evidence to help the public understand how to interrupt sitting in ways that support healthy aging.  ","Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality",9720802,P01AG052352,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Computational Technique', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Endothelium', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Latina', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Postmenopause', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'age effect', 'age group', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'disability', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'exercise intervention', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'older women', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'response biomarker', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P01,2019,1795436,0.06990346436444829
"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI. The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years. One of our overarching goals is to achieve a highly useful 7T clinical utility, which requires high quality, robust, and consistent acquisitions. This could be a potentially exclusive (over other human MRI field strengths) application for 7T imaging.",High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression,9729082,R01MH111265,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Consultations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Edema', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Gliosis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heating', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'Work', 'absorption', 'aging brain', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disturbance in affect', 'follow-up', 'geriatric depression', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'radio frequency', 'recruit', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'vascular depression']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,600019,0.08713987921176702
"Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in older adults (≥65y) is rising, and there is limited evidence-based guidance on treating these older adults. In older patients with multi-morbidity, treatment decisions should factor in not only risk of disease complications, but also treatment complications and non-IBD, extra-intestinal complications. Hence, to inform optimal treatment approach, a comprehensive assessment of comparative effects of different therapies on all of these outcomes is warranted. Existing single-center observational studies are limited by small sample size, and missing data due to fragmented health care, whereas administrative claims-based studies are limited by lack of detailed clinical data; these limitations can be overcome by linking the two data sources. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Siddharth Singh proposes to: (Aim #1.1) characterize disease burden and treatment patterns, (Aim #1.2) assess and predict risks of death, disease, treatment and extra-intestinal complications using machine-learning algorithms and (Aim #2.1) compare overall effectiveness and (Aim #2.2) safety of different treatment strategies in older patients with IBD. This will be studied using a highly innovative informatics-based approach in a multi-site, electronic medical record (EMR)-based cohort of older patients with IBD, linked to their corresponding Medicare claims. The EMR-based cohort will facilitate phenotyping and disease severity assessment, and linkage to Medicare claims will augment exposure and outcome ascertainment, overcoming challenges of fragmentation of healthcare and short follow-up. The central hypothesis is that, that older adults have systematically different risk profiles than younger adults, and using biologic monotherapy is a safer and more effective approach to treating IBD, as compared to using long-term corticosteroids alone, non-biologic immunomodulator monotherapy, and combination therapy of biologics and immunomodulators. The access to the advanced infrastructure of pSCANNER (Patient-centered Scalable National Network for Effectiveness Research), one of 13 PCORI-funded Clinical Data Research Networks, and entire Medicare database, in a highly supportive and conducive environment at UCSD, with cross-disciplinary mentorship by a collaborative and experienced team of mentors and advisors from diverse backgrounds (clinical informatics, comparative effectiveness research, IBD therapeutics) is a key strength of this application. Besides directly informing clinical practice on treatment approaches in older patients with IBD, this proposal will enhance the career of the candidate by providing unique skills in applied clinical informatics, privacy-preserving record linkage techniques, predictive analytics, and comparative effectiveness research, and create a multi-institutional, EMR- based cohort of well-characterized IBD patients, linked with Medicare claims. This will ultimately contribute to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career focusing on comparative effectiveness research and population health management using novel informatics-based approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The information on comparative effectiveness and safety of different therapies in the context of patients' risk profile generated using this novel informatics-based approach in a unique linked EMR-Medicare database, will directly inform treatment of older patients with IBD, and enhance comparative effectiveness research methods.",Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,9735225,K23DK117058,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunomodulators', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Steroids', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Thromboembolism', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health management', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'preservation', 'risk minimization', 'skills', 'treatment risk', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K23,2019,203990,0.05670231729779867
"4/5 HEAL Consortium: Establishing Innovative Approaches  for the HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study Opioid use among pregnant women is increasing significantly, and consequently, a more than 5-fold increase in the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) has been reported since 2000. Preliminary studies show that prenatal opioid exposure is associated with increased risk of impaired neurodevelopment across cognitive, motor and behavioral domains.

"3/5 HEAL Consortium: Establishing Innovative Approaches  for the HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study ABSTRACT Opioid use among pregnant women is increasing significantly, and consequently, a more than 5-fold increase in the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) has been reported since 2000. Preliminary studies show that prenatal opioid exposure is associated with increased risk of impaired neurodevelopment across cognitive, motor and behavioral domains. Therefore, studies to rigorously characterize the impacts of prenatal opioid exposure on early brain development are critically needed. In our application, five institutions (Duke University, Arkansas Children’s Research Institute, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) with complementary expertise, have formed a consortium to develop strategies to prepare for the Phase II HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study, a planned large scale multi-site research study to examine the long-term impact of prenatal drug exposure on long term childhood outcomes. Leveraging the unique skills of our multidisciplinary team, we will develop essential instruments and strategies (recruitment/retention protocols, assessment batteries, and novel tools) for the Phase II study (Aim 1). We will conduct pilot studies (fetal and postnatal imaging, advanced imaging harmonization and quality control, assessment administration, biosampling) to evaluate instruments for the Phase II study (Aim 2).

"Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health PROJECT SUMMARY Nearly 10% of Americans practice meditation to improve health. Randomized controlled trials support this practice and show that mindfulness training is effective in improving a broad range of health outcomes. In particular, mindfulness training has been shown to reduce biomarkers of systemic inflammation that contribute to the pathophysiology of disease and predict risk for all-cause mortality. Still, little is known about the biological processes linking mindfulness training with inflammation. This proposal tests the hypothesis that mindfulness training aids the regulation of inflammation by mitigating glucocorticoid resistance (GCR). GCR is a leading candidate mechanism linking psychosocial threat with systemic inflammation. Whereas cortisol released in response to threat normally binds to glucocorticoid receptors and down-regulates inflammation, chronic perceptions of threat lead to a state of GCR, in which glucocorticoid receptors become insensitive to the anti-inflammatory effects of circulating cortisol. Mindfulness training is proposed to diminish perceptions of threat in ways that restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. To test this biological pathway, this study assesses functional GCR and biomarkers of inflammation before and after a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or control Health Enhancement Program (HEP) in a sample of lonely older adults (N=188). Loneliness is a form of chronic psychosocial threat, and is consistently associated with GCR and systemic inflammation, yet MBSR is one of very few interventions successful in reducing loneliness. MBSR is expected to decrease GCR (and restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity) compared to HEP from pre- to post- intervention. Moreover, these decreases in GCR are expected to mediate the effects of MBSR (vs. HEP) on lowering systemic inflammation (CRP and IL-6) from pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up. In sum, this proposal investigates decreased GCR as a biological mechanism through which mindfulness training reduces inflammatory disease risk. It addresses NCCIH's call for research on understanding the biological mechanisms of action underlying mind-body intervention approaches and complements NCCIH's special interest in alleviating inflammatory processes. The knowledge gained from this research will contribute to a better understanding of the basic biological pathways underlying mindfulness practices, which may help to identify and target populations likely to benefit from mindfulness training. The research and training plan described in this application provide opportunities for the applicant to develop a knowledge base and methodology in psychoneuroimmunology, learn statistical techniques for analyzing complex mechanistic pathways, and develop the professional skills necessary for a successful career testing biological and psychological mechanisms underlying mind-body interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mindfulness meditation practices are widely used to alleviate physical symptoms, and growing evidence suggests that mindfulness training may reduce systemic inflammation, but less is known about the biological pathways linking mindfulness training with inflammatory processes. The proposed project investigates a biological mechanism, glucocorticoid sensitivity, to explain how mindfulness training lowers inflammation among lonely older adults who are at risk for multiple inflammatory diseases. From a public health perspective, clarifying this mechanistic pathway will help to identify who is likely to show health benefits from mindfulness training.",Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health,9688917,F32AT009508,"['Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood Circulation', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Dexamethasone', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Feeling', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Immune', 'Immunology procedure', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meditation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Mind-Body Intervention', 'Mindfulness Training', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychoneuroimmunology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy trial', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'falls', 'feasibility trial', 'follow-up', 'health training', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mindfulness meditation', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'physical symptom', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'receptor function', 'receptor sensitivity', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'successful intervention', 'training aid', 'training opportunity']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2019,66110,0.011574238125944818
"Determinants of insufficient sleep among blacks and effects on disparities in health outcomes Project Summary Insufficient sleep (IS), stemming from sleep apnea, shift work, insomnia, working over 40 hr./week, unfavorable sleep environments and/or volitional reduction of bedtime, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) markers (elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and arterial stiffness), inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein) as well as with brain injury. Compelling evidence shows racial/ethnic disparities in insufficient sleep (IS), with blacks exhibiting a three-fold greater risk of IS relative to whites. Disparities might arise from physiologic and genetic factors, but recent evidence suggests environmental and psychosocial factors are also critical determinants. This study will utilize innovative dynamic modeling in a multi-level framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants (associative factors) of actigraphic IS and its putative associations with adverse health outcomes among blacks. Individual- and contextual-level data will be captured using novel home-based recordings and GIS data to model the environmental context where sleep occurs. The proposed study will leverage success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup led by Dr. Jean- Louis (PI), who has been conducting community-engaged sleep research for over 10 years. The workgroup comprises outstanding investigators with expertise in sleep and circadian rhythm, CVD, brain health, health disparities, translational behavioral medicine, and multi-level dynamic modeling. The study will benefit from experience of our standing Community Steering Committee, enabling recruitment of 560 blacks in various venues to participate in weeklong home studies to achieve proposed study aims. The multidisciplinary team will: 1) identify psychosocial (social support, discrimination, and attitudes/beliefs) and environmental (household [density, noise, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital, and neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with IS; ascertain effects of IS on (a) markers of CVD (obesity, BP, lipid profile, and glucose/ HbA1C) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) and on (b) markers of brain injury (tau, amyloid-β, neurofilament light, homocysteine, and glial fibrillary acidic protein; and develop profiles of blacks with IS-related adverse health outcomes using individual- and environmental-level data applying innovative multi-level dynamic modeling tools (Bayesia Belief Network and Agent-Based Simulation). This study will provide evidence to delineate factors underlying greater rates of IS among blacks and explain putative associations with markers of CVD, inflammation, and brain injury. These data will provide the foundation for longitudinal studies assessing causal effects of IS on these novel markers and interventions to mitigate adverse effects of IS on health outcomes. Project Narrative This proposal is predicated upon compelling data that blacks exhibit a three-fold greater risk of insufficient sleep (<7 hours) compared with whites, and that insufficient sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and brain injury. It will provide multi-level evidence on the impact of the psychosocial and environmental factors on insufficient sleep among blacks.

"CRCNS: Unsupervised Learning of Hippocampal Sequence Dynamic in Sleep   In unit recordings from large populations of neurons, fast compressed sequential firing of neurons during rest and early sleep have been found to replay patterns first observed in active awake experience. These remarkable patterns have sparked widespread interest in the scientific community and beyond. Sequence  replay is now considered to play a critical role in the long-term stabilization and storage of mnemonically  important information. However, despite the general acknowledgement of the importance of the sequential structure, very little is known about the null background against which replay is compared. Specifically, are apparently 'non-replaying' spike patterns, as seen in late sleep, just simply noise? Because replay is typically assessed by comparison against a fixed known template, most methods can only determine whether the resemblance to the template is more than what might be expected from  random spike trains. But these methods cannot appraise whether other patterns remain in the nonsignificant events. Recently, the Diba and Kemere labs successfully collaborated to address precisely  this issue. We developed methods based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) to uncover temporal structure in spike trains of neurons in an unsupervised template-free manner. In this proposal, we aim to further improve these methods and to evaluate the hidden structure of spike trains in hippocampal  neuronal populations during sleep. In our second specific aim, we will use HMMs to determine both co-active ensemble (""contextual"") and temporal patterns (""sequential"") structure in hippocampal spike trains in both pre- and post-task sleep. In the third specific aim, we will probe the essence of sleep replay further, by exposing animals to multiple novel and familiar maze environments prior to long durations of sleep. In the fourth specific aim, we will perform closed-loop disruption of neuronal population patterns to  examine the causal interplay and reverberation of these patterns from early to late sleep. In summary, our  proposal is designed to provide strongest characterization to date of the structure of ""noise"" in replay events. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This study will provide an opening to evaluate the role of sleep in reorganizing information in the brain and  help to identify critical time windows and neuronal activities during sleep which are particularly important  for information storage and stabilization. Our assumptions and deductions about the nature and purpose  of sleep implicitly inform all manner of public policy, from the durations of shifts for hospital and relief  workers, to morning start times of public schools.

"Mentorship in the Endocrinology of Sleep The overarching goal of this application for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to foster training of promising junior investigators in cutting edge patient-oriented research related to how sleep biology influences cardiometabolic health. It capitalizes on the established network and resources of the recently renewed UCLA CTSI that includes a highly successful KL2 program. Dr. Liu led a competitively- funded Endocrine and Cardiometabolic Program in Sleep Biology at the University of Sydney, and since 2012, he has led a similar interdisciplinary research program in Los Angeles supported by a 5 year NHLBI R01 “Hormonal mechanisms of sleep restriction” that is currently in its 3rd year. During his 10 years of mentoring, he has trained 16 individuals: 10 remaining in academic medicine and 2 others in industry-related patient orientated research. Three of his trainees won major US young investigator awards under his supervision. He continues to support, mentor, and publish with former trainees, often long after they left his laboratory.  Disturbed sleep causes insulin resistance, promotes poor food choices, and curtails fat loss while dieting, thereby reducing the effectiveness of standard weight loss programs. However, the cardiometabolic consequences of disturbed sleep are not well recognized by the community, and the evidential bases to justify widespread changes to community sleeping patterns for cardiometabolic health reasons are evolving. Showing the mechanisms by which sleep restriction leads to cardiometabolic ill-health, particularly in older adults according to sex, are critical steps in providing these data. Dr. Liu's goal is to mentor the next cadre of independent clinical scientists focused on placing sleep alongside diet and exercise as part of healthy lifestyle, by understanding hormonal mechanisms and consequences of disrupted, inadequate or misaligned sleep.  The work proposed in this application fulfill these goals. Aim 1 will reveal the hypothalmo-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal mechanisms that cause testosterone-cortisol imbalance when sleep is restricted in older men and women (20 in each group). In doing so, trainees will learn endocrine physiology and chronobiological study design, IRB processes, recruitment skills, and hands-on study management. Aim 2 will identify sex differences in these mechanisms, trainees will learn statistical methods and abstract/presentation/ manuscript preparation. Aim 3 requires trainees to discover new mechanisms by which sleep restriction causes insulin resistance and alters appetite or food intake. Certain inflammatory mediators, hormones, or factors related to ethnicity or age could be studied. Aim 3 fulfils broader expectations for trainees to have a second project that is faster to accomplish, more exploratory, and driven by their interests and available resources, to develop a line of research that complements and is separate from that of the mentors. Taken together, these experiments will generate new knowledge of the relationship between sleep and hormonal cardiometabolic and reproductive health, provide wide-ranging training opportunities, and generate future R and K proposals. Narrative Insufficient sleep is common, and leads to insulin resistance, a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This proposal attempts to reveal the hormonal mechanisms underlying the link between insufficient sleep with insulin resistance in older adults, the population at greatest risk for disordered sleep and metabolic disorders as a vehicle to provide outstanding mentorship opportunities.",Mentorship in the Endocrinology of Sleep,9692343,K24HL138632,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Award', 'Biology', 'Carbohydrates', 'Catabolism', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Corticotropin', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Cosyntropin', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Physiology', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gonadal structure', 'Gonadotropin Hormone Releasing Hormone', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone imbalance', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Hunger', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Infusion procedures', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Ketoconazole', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicine', 'Menopause', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Osteoporosis', 'Ovary', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Sex Differences', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Statistical Methods', 'Steroid biosynthesis', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virulence Factors', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'bone age', 'cardiometabolism', 'diabetes risk', 'diet and exercise', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'ganirelix', 'healthy lifestyle', 'hormonal signals', 'insulin sensitivity', 'interest', 'male', 'men', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'older men', 'older women', 'patient oriented research', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'sex', 'skills', 'sleep pattern', 'targeted treatment', 'training opportunity', 'weight loss program', 'young adult']",NHLBI,LUNDQUIST INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION AT HARBOR-UCLA MEDICAL CENTER,K24,2019,119586,0.06618808104644218

"Frailty, Statins, and Cardiovascular Disease Burden in Older Adults Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in older adults. Statins are highly effective cholesterol-lowering medications used for primary prevention of CVD, and are the most commonly prescribed medications. After age 75, data on the effects of statins are limited to guide statin prescribing recommendations. However, even where the evidence is clear, statins remain under-prescribed. Reasons for under-prescribing of proven CVD prevention medications such as statins in older adults are many, and may include competing medical conditions, adverse side effects (e.g., myalgias), and frailty. Frailty is a multidimensional state of decreased physiologic reserve associated with an increased risk of CVD and poor clinical outcomes. The aging population is heterogeneous and a one-size fits all approach may not be appropriate. In particular, understanding the utility of statins for prevention of CVD in individuals who are vulnerable or frail is critical. Therefore, the research activities in this GEMSSTAR award will use a retrospective design to (1) understand patterns of statin use in a large cohort of older US veterans aged 65 and older, over 15 years of follow up, with particular attention to the relationship between frailty, myalgias and statin use; and (2) examine the association between statin use for primary prevention of CVD in pre-frail and frail older veterans and cardiovascular events, health care utilization, and mortality. This work will inform the design of future clinical trials of statins for prevention of CVD in older adults accounting for heterogeneity of aging and frailty. In addition to the pharmacoepidemiologic study proposed, this GEMSSTAR award includes mentorship, coursework, and seminars in advanced epidemiologic and statistical methods, geriatrics, and cardiology. The research and career development activities will prepare the applicant for her long-term goal of a research career in geriatric preventive cardiology and will inform preventive care for the aging population. As the population ages, identifying preventive strategies for heart disease and stroke is a priority. However, proven preventive medications such as the cholesterol-lowering statins remain underused. In this study, we aim to understand patterns of statin use in older adults to shed light on why statins may be underused even where evidence is clear, and to examine whether statins are useful in preventing heart disease and stroke in older adults who are vulnerable or frail.","Frailty, Statins, and Cardiovascular Disease Burden in Older Adults",9753091,R03AG060169,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Frail Elderly', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Medical', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myalgia', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive therapy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Role', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'aging population', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'prevent', 'research and development', 'side effect', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R03,2019,96525,0.0643572291555826
"Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects 70% of older adults and remains the leading cause of morbidity and mor- tality in the United States. Several new drugs have recently been approved for CVD, but not enough is known about their utilization, benefits and risks in frail older patients. Since conducting a clinical trial in frail older adults can be costly and impractical, there is a pressing need for innovative strategies to generate evidence on new CVD drugs in a timely manner. The objective of this application is to establish a near-real-time prospective monitoring program in Medicare data to evaluate the benefit of new CVD drugs for older adults with frailty. A prospective monitoring program seeks to find early effectiveness and safety signals of new drugs by updating the analysis at regular intervals as new Medicare data become available. The investigators will incorporate a novel claims-based frailty index into the monitoring program to generate timely evidence on disease-specific and patient-centered net benefit of new drugs by frailty status. The central hypothesis is that disease-specific benefit and net benefit are determined by a patient's degree of frailty. Disease-specific benefit will be evaluated using clinical trial endpoints of effectiveness (e.g., CVD events) and safety (e.g., bleeding), and net benefit in terms of the number of days alive and spent at home, or “home time”. To conduct this work, the investigators will analyze Medicare data on 6 new CVD drugs approved in 2011-2017: 3 anticoagulants vs warfarin for atrial fibrillation, 2 antiplatelets vs clopidogrel for atherosclerotic CVD, and an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor vs enalapril for systolic heart failure. The validity and reproducibility of the results will be enhanced through the linkage of a subset of Medicare data to electronic health records and a national survey to supplement clinical information, and external validation of the Medicare data analysis in 2 large commercial databases. In the next 4 years, the investigators will accomplish 3 specific aims: 1) evaluate the temporal trends and predictors of new CVD drug use in frail and non-frail older adults with CVD over 2011-2020; 2) determine disease-specific benefit (deaths, CVD and safety events) and net benefit (home time) of 6 new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies; 3) identify patient characteristics that can predict net benefit (home time) with new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies. This proposal's innovative approach, which combines near-real-time prospective monitor- ing, a claims-based frailty score, and the patient-centered outcome of home time, offers a readily scalable and feasible framework for comparative effectiveness and safety studies of newly approved medications. The impact of the proposed research is significant because timely evidence generated from real-world healthcare data can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new CVD drugs based on a patient's frailty and expected net benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to establish a prospective monitoring program for newly approved cardiovascular drugs for older adults with frailty in routine healthcare databases and identify predictors of benefit from the new drugs. This research is relevant to public health because the evidence generated from this work can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new cardiovascular drugs in older adults based on a patient's frailty level and expected net benefit. Thus, it accomplishes the National Institute on Aging's missions and initiatives by promoting effective and safe drug therapy in older adults.",Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty,9711825,R01AG062713,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Anticoagulants', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enalapril', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frail Elderly', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neprilysin', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clopidogrel', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'frailty', 'head-to-head comparison', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'safety study', 'sex']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,783556,0.022680605008605775
"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9691090,R01AG057704,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Biogenesis', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Certificates', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hand', 'Handwriting', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Resources', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immigrant', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Maiden Name', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Minnesota', 'Minority Groups', 'Names', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Price', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Science', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Toxin', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'early-life nutrition', 'ethnic minority population', 'frontier', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'population health', 'population survey', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'suicide rate']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,308553,0.010009847626514315
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9547370,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Drug Screening', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Prescription opioid overdose', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,585626,0.019345477272289417
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9535033,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2018,460052,0.02257389800181083
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,9534766,R01NR016732,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Nursing', 'Research', 'Self Management', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain health', 'care costs', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'design', 'health assessment', 'health care delivery', 'health management', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'personalized intervention', 'physical conditioning', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology validation', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'usability']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,357881,0.036278442850991514
"Using existing data to understand and ameliorate risk in opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, leading to unprecedented levels of overdose deaths and other harms. Effective treatment for opioid use disorders is available, in the form of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine. However, there are significant questions about the risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization during and after treatment, and unplanned treatment cessation. What is the magnitude of these risks, and what patient, treatment setting, and provider factors may contribute to or protect against risk? Additionally, it is increasingly clear that more sophisticated approaches to patient assessment and treatment planning than are currently used are needed to minimise risk. We aim to: 1. Determine the magnitude of risk for specific adverse clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, hospitalization and ED presentation, and unplanned treatment cessation) during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; 2. Identify patient, treatment setting, and provider risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; and 3. Develop a risk prediction model to identify patients at greatest risk of adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT. To achieve these aims, this project will use existing population-based Australian data on OAT, linked to several health and criminal justice datasets to provide a rich understanding of treatment exposures and outcomes. These data will be used to inform strategies to guide the delivery of high-quality treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States. Specifically, the project will provide data about the magnitude of risk of adverse clinical outcomes during specific treatment and post-treatment periods, and identify patient, treatment setting and provider factors that influence risk. Additionally, it will use innovative machine learning techniques to demonstrate the potential for routinely collected data to be used to assess patient risk at point-of-care, allowing for the development of tailored treatment plans that minimize risk and maximize treatment retention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid agonist therapy is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder, including prescription opioid use disorder. However, important questions about safety and risks during treatment remain unanswered.

"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood. In a more globally connected and computerized world, older adults may constitute particular at-risk targets for highly effective forms of online financial fraud, such as through social engineering in the form of emails containing malicious links or attachments (phishing). Susceptibility to financial deception in aging has been investigated primarily in the context of age-related cognitive decline, while socioemotional and neurophysiological parameters have been largely understudied. Further, there are few effective approaches to characterize, monitor and detect, and eventually prevent, financial deception. The objectives of the proposed research are threefold: Aim 1 will determine financial deception risk across the adult life span. This aim will seek to confirm that age is associated with greater susceptibility to financial deception, online and in person. Aim 2 will characterize cognitive, socioemotional, and neurophysiological mechanisms associated with deception risk. Specifically, this aim will uncover the extent to which cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction, age-related dampening in neurophysiological reactivity, and structural and functional brain changes contribute to increased susceptibility in aging. Aim 3 involves the development and psychometric validation of a novel risk assessment interview and the development of an automated deception warning tool to alert older adults about potential online fraud. Our research design will span three data collection phases comprising healthy young, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old individuals. Leveraging infrastructure developed in our lab, a behavioral field experiment will determine real-life susceptibility to financial fraud via simulated phishing email attacks (Phase I). A comprehensive in-lab assessment of cognitive/socioemotional and neurophysiological mechanisms will follow (Phase II and III, respectively). A data-analytic Phase IV will integrate data collected across Phases I-III using statistical and machine-learning methods. This multidisciplinary approach, encompassing psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering will lay the foundation for building an integrated approach to risk detection and the provision of financial decision-making supports in older adulthood. Findings and methodologies developed as part of this project have the potential to inform real-life decision-supportive interventions that adopt an age-targeted approach towards the long-term goal of financial risk reduction in older individuals. Project Narrative A rapidly aging population means that financial deception of the aged is an emerging public health problem that requires surveillance and intervention. An increasingly common form of financial fraud is conducted online as older adults more and more manage their assets online. The project goal is to determine cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological risk factors for financial deception in older adults and validate risk assessment and develop detection tools toward a long-term goal of identifying individuals who are particularly susceptible to financial fraud and facilitating prevention and decision-supportive intervention efforts.",Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging,9523024,R01AG057764,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Deception', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Educational Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Foundations', 'Fraud', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Structure', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Transact', 'Validation', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cyber security', 'decision-making capacity', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'financial decision making', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'learning strategy', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'phishing', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2018,328606,0.08338240354593988
"Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Individual sleep disorders and characteristics are known to be associated with adverse health outcomes. However, few studies consider sleep in a multivariate context. Therefore, we propose a paradigmatic shift in sleep research towards sleep health. Conducting research through a sleep health lens can change health practice by clarifying which sleep characteristics are most important to treat, enhancing screening efforts, and facilitating the generalization of findings to all individuals, not just those with specific sleep disorders or complaints. Before achieving these long-term goals, however, the crucial first steps in the study of sleep health are to determine which sleep profiles predict health outcomes (Aim 1), and develop predictive algorithms that can identify individuals at risk of adverse health outcomes based on their sleep and other risk factors (Aim 2). These aims can only be achieved with an awareness of the statistical challenges related to the inherent multidimensionality of sleep health (e.g. multiple domains of sleep, multiple characteristics to represent each domain, multiple data sources, etc.). This multidimensionality generates substantial methodological barriers regarding variable and model selection and threatens researchers' abilities to develop transparent and reproducible models. In this R01, investigators will apply rigorous, sophisticated statistical methods to a large aggregated sample of adults aged >60 with self-report and polysomnographic characterization and over 10 years of longitudinal follow-up from three parent studies: Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study (MrOS), Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). In Aim 1, investigators will determine which multidimensional sleep profiles predict time to mortality in older adults using Cox-proportional hazards models, tree-structured survival analysis, and clustering. In Aim 2, investigators will develop powerful machine learning algorithms that incorporate sleep and other risk factors to identify which older adults have the greatest risk for early mortality. Within each aim, the impact of sex and race will be rigorously investigated, and models will be internally validated in independent samples to ensure reproducibility. The Secondary Aim is to investigate generalizability to studies with different demographic profiles and sleep protocols (Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, Honolulu Asia Aging Study of Sleep America) and different data types (sleep diary, actigraphy). All models will be developed in the context of other important known risk factors, including but not limited to age, gender, race, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and BMI. Findings from Aim 1 will jumpstart subsequent mechanistic research focused on sleep-related causal factors of mortality, leading to identification of targeted treatments for sleep problems that could reduce risk of mortality and morbidity. Findings from Aim 2 will provide important preliminary evidence for enhanced screening tools that can more accurately identify which individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project initiates a paradigmatic research shift by studying multivariate sleep health in older adults. Cutting- edge statistical methods will be applied to a large, multi-cohort sample, and replicability of findings will be rigorously investigated. Achieving the proposed aims will improve health practice by: (1) determining which multivariate sleep profiles predict mortality in older adults, thereby jumpstarting subsequent mechanistic research on sleep-related causal factors of mortality and targeted treatments to reduce mortality; and (2) suggesting prediction algorithms that incorporate sleep to enhance health screening for adverse health outcomes in older adults.",Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods,9534484,R01AG056331,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Vision', 'Wakefulness', 'Well in self', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'diaries', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'health practice', 'improved', 'lens', 'men', 'mortality', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prediction algorithm', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sex', 'sleep health', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,298548,0.10361014305628423
"Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] needed for older adults to maintain optimal physical function is unknown. Institute of Medicine and Endocrine Society have publicly debated on 20 ng/mL or 30 ng/mL, respectively, as targets for skeletal health, but both groups agree that stronger evidence is needed to identify target concentrations for extra-skeletal outcomes, e.g., falls and physical function. The problem is significant: >25% of older adults have poor physical function, 50% have 25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and 30 ng/mL. Identifying 25(OH)D targets for older adults will have immediate impact by informing design and analysis of vitamin D supplementation trials. Namely, targets serve as inclusion/exclusion criteria or baseline subgroups and as secondary outcomes. Our solution is to empirically identify and validate sex-specific (possibly stratified by other factors; e.g., race, genetic variants) 25(OH)D targets in older adults (= 65 years) related to lowe risk of falls and better physical function using existing NIH-funded datasets. A critical challenge is that 25(OH)D cannot be randomized; therefore observational data are a crucial part of the solution. Conventional statistical methods are ill-equipped for this problem; thus, we will develop novel statistical methods by adapting and refining structural modeling and machine-learning methods, and apply them to our aims. We will carry out the aims using 4 prospective cohort studies comprising >12,500 older adults: Health, Aging, and Body Composition, Invecchiare in Chianti, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. We will: 1) identify and validate 25(OH)D targets for falls reduction, mobility, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living (functional outcomes); and gait speed, muscle strength, and frailty (proximal conditions) (aim 1); 2) characterize the joint impact of 25(OH)D and serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations on functional outcomes/proximal conditions (aim 2); and 3) quantify mediation of 25(OH)D on functional outcomes/proximal conditions by endocrine and metabolic factors (PTH, serum alkaline phosphatase, aklotho, fibroblast growth factor 23) (aim 3). We will write code in SAS and R statistical languages and disseminate it to the scientific community for use in additional research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aging of the population is expected to lead to an increased burden of poor physical function and loss of independence. Low concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are common in older adults and may be one reason for deficits in physical function. Since 25(OH)D can easily be increased by sunlight exposure, diet, and supplements; identifying and validating a target 25(OH)D for functional outcomes in older adults can have a significant impact on public health.",Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults,9260731,R01AG048069,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Body mass index', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gait speed', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Living', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intake', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'PTH gene', 'Phosphorus', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Sun Exposure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Woman', 'Writing', 'analytical method', 'bone', 'bone health', 'calcium intake', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic variant', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sarcopenia', 'secondary analysis', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'skeletal', 'ultraviolet']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2018,320160,0.08859277000093538
"An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics Project Summary Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper neurological development. During sleep, there is enhanced synaptic plasticity in the nervous system in addition to often extensive neural remodeling. Although we know that sleep regulation is important to neurological development, many aspects of sleep regulation are poorly understood. In particular, the mechanisms of how we compensate for missed sleep in future sleep cycles are mysterious, despite general knowledge of how circadian rhythms are established. It is likely that these mechanisms involve neuropeptide signaling in the brain. However, current tools to study the roles these peptides play in sleep homeostasis, even with the use of simple model organisms like C. elegans, are low- throughput, qualitative, and subjective. In order to study sleep-like behavior in C. elegans, there is an unmet need for a tool for continuously monitoring and perturbing long-term behavior of the worm, as well as an automated and un-biased method for quantifying behavioral data. In this proposal, we will first develop the enabling technology, and use it to identify the roles of neuropeptides in homeostasis of the nematode’s sleep- like state. In Aim I, we will engineer and validate a scalable microscopy platform for monitoring and perturbing C. elegans behavior, decreasing the cost of long-term candidate screens by ~ 100 fold. In Aim 2, we will quantify behavior of wild-type animals via an automated and bias-free quantitative analysis to establish baseline behavior and prioritize behaviors that are linked to sleep homeostasis. In Aim 3, we will use the technology developed in Aims I and 2 to quantify differences in behavior of C. elegans neuropeptide mutants using a candidate approach. Because of the strong preliminary data we have gathered so far and the experience of the sponsor’s laboratory, this proposed work is likely to identify the roles of these candidate neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis, contributing to our mechanistic understanding of sleep regulation. Furthermore, the tools we develop for this particular study will also have broad utilities in many other problems, such as developmental programming, aging, and neurobehavioral studies. Project Narrative Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper brain development and is linked to a variety of neurological and behavioral disorders. In particular, how animals correct for interrupted sleep cycles in future cycles could lead to therapeutic targets, but apart from a few implicated neuropeptides, little is known about the mechanisms behind this aspect of sleep. The objective of this proposal is to identify the roles of neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis by screening C. elegans mutants for behavioral defects.",An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics,9545566,F31GM123662,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drug Screening', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Interruption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Middle Insomnia', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropeptides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Reproduction', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Study models', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'age related', 'behavioral study', 'circadian pacemaker', 'cost', 'developmental genetics', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurobehavioral', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sleep regulation', 'software development', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2018,44524,0.05615303425403343
"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease, their families, the healthcare system, and the economy.

"Biosignatures of opioid addiction treatment success The United States has experienced a four-fold increase in medical opioid use over the last two  decades. Medical opioid abuse and addiction have increased and afflict 5% and 2% of US adults  respectively; heroin addiction afflicts 0.5% of US adults. In 2016, >39,000 US individuals died of  a medical opioid, illicit opiate or synthetic opioid overdose, an increase of 18% from 2015. While  opioid addiction treatment admissions and treatment capacity have increased many-fold over the last  two decades, patient needs greatly exceed capacity. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) approaches for opioid use disorder include three approved  pharmacotherapies combined with psychosocial and supportive therapies. Active investigations are  evaluating established and novel therapies for opioid detoxification prior to MAT. MATs have  established but limited efficacy in treating opioid use disorders compared to placebo  pharmacotherapy. Patients treated with MATs have mortality rates during and after treatment that  exceed population mortality rates. Improving efficacy through personalized treatment is essential  to optimize MAT resources and reduce mortality. “Biosignatures of opioid addiction treatment success” offers a data science solution that aligns  with NIDA priorities and Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidance to expand use of MAT, and with HHS  priorities to support cutting edge research on pain and addiction. Our overall aim is to decode the  predictors of MAT success and enable health care providers to improve treatment efficacy using  accurate forecasting. In Aim 1, we will create a platform for applying learning algorithms to existing and future opioid  addiction treatment data. We will organize and merge clinical, treatment, and outcome variables  from clinical trials of opioid addiction treatment publicly available through the NIDA Data Share  resource. We will import these data into a database optimized for high dimensional data analysis.  Workflows will be developed to apply multiple Bayesian learning algorithms to the data. In Aim 2,  using the biosignature learning platform, we will identify sets of variables that together predict  opioid addiction treatment success. We will apply this platform to each trial independently, and  then to multiple trials in an integrative analysis. The learned biosignatures will be ranked by how  well they predict treatment success. The best models will be incorporated into a proof-of-concept calculator. The calculator will provide treatment success scores based on the  characteristics of new patients. We will present the prototype to multiple stakeholders for  assessment. At the end of Phase I, we will have created a biosignature learning platform and a proof-of-concept  opioid addiction treatment success calculator. We plan to fully develop these components with  additional datasets and variables in Phase II. Our commercial goal is to develop licensable and  easily deployable algorithms for healthcare networks treating opioid addiction. The algorithm will  help providers understand profiles of patients likely to be successful with MAT and to personalize  treatment strategies to maximize abstinence. In this project, we are using algorithms to learn the predictors of opioid addiction treatment  success from publicly available clinical trial data. Healthcare providers can use these models to  improve their opioid addiction treatment programs.",Biosignatures of opioid addiction treatment success,9559228,R43DA046325,"['Abstinence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Buprenorphine', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonidine', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Fentanyl', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Heroin', 'Heroin Dependence', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methadone', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid agonist', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Published Comment', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Supportive care', 'Tramadol', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Veterans', 'addiction', 'base', 'biosignature', 'clinical translation', 'data sharing', 'experience', 'heroin use', 'high dimensionality', 'illicit opioid', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'lofexidine', 'medication compliance', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'overdose risk', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'success', 'treatment program', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,BIOREALM,R43,2018,224152,0.01653650031813102
"A Novel, Patient-Centered Prognostic Tool for Adults with Critical Illness Project Summary/Abstract:  A growing number of older adults in the United States who are near the end of life are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with acute critical illness and receive invasive medical treatments. The use of prolonged life-sustaining treatments such as mechanical ventilation for older adults near death is common and increasing over time. However, most older adults report end-of-life care preferences to prioritize their comfort and quality of life near death over burdensome life-sustaining treatments. To make medical treatment decisions that are aligned with end-of-life-care preferences, patients and their surrogates require meaningful prognostic information in the setting of an acute illness. However, traditional prognostic tools for critically ill patients have focused on estimating patients' risk of death. Patients and surrogates often struggle to interpret or use mortality estimates for decision making, and the dichotomous outcome of mortality fails to describe the longitudinal trajectory of a patient's illness. We hypothesize that a novel tool that incorporates longitudinal prognostic information and a more descriptive account of potential outcomes will help patients, surrogates, and ICU physicians make treatment decisions that are aligned with end-of-life care preferences.  The central goals of this NRSA Individual Fellowship are to (1) facilitate the candidate's career development into an independent, successful health services researcher in critical care medicine and (2) address the disparity between end-of-life medical care that is delivered in the United States and patients' goals values, and preferences. The candidate and her mentors have designed a training plan to accomplish these goals that includes two specific research objectives. First, we aim to create a novel, longitudinal predictive model for critically ill adults that characterizes the expected trajectory of medical treatments over time and a description of the patient's likely outcome. To accomplish our first objective, we will apply the innovative tools of predictive analytics from the field of engineering (i.e. robust machine learning) to a large EHR-derived clinical database of all admissions to an adult medical ICU over 3 years (N ≈ 3,000 patients). The predictive model will characterize discrete, temporal patterns of patients' exposure to medical treatments during an ICU stay (“illness trajectories”) and describe the outcomes of patients who follow each trajectory. Second, we plan to use the output of our predictive model to design a user-centered prognostic tool for clinical use. Using both real and hypothetical output from our predictive model, we will engage critically ill patients (if able to participate), their surrogate decision-makers, and critical care clinicians to design and iteratively revise a prognostic tool that presents longitudinal data. The stakeholders will participate in qualitative interviews and focus groups to provide feedback about the content, format, and usability of the tool for treatment decisions in the ICU. This study will lead to the prototype of a novel, patient-centered prognostic tool that is designed to better align treatment decisions in the ICU with patients' end-of-life care preferences. Project Narrative Many critically ill patients and their families are confronted with a decision between life-prolonging but burdensome treatments or comfort-focused medical care that may lead to an earlier death. These decisions can be very difficult when there is uncertainty about whether the patient can recover and what the patient's life will be like during the illness and recovery. To help with these difficult decisions, we propose a study to design a new tool to help patients, families, and ICU clinicians predict the range of possible outcomes for an individual patient.","A Novel, Patient-Centered Prognostic Tool for Adults with Critical Illness",9467697,F32HL140824,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'American', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Group Interviews', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Sampling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'care preference', 'career', 'career development', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional status', 'human old age (65+)', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient oriented', 'post-doctoral training', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prototype', 'skills', 'surrogate decision maker', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F32,2018,59886,0.028967659115225933
"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9496395,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,618216,0.1019244195124014

We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9706344,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,331584,0.1019244195124014
"Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of the proposed K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to provide the PI with the mentorship, theoretical knowledge, and research skills to develop into a fully independent psychophysiological researcher studying biomarkers of depression that can be used as targets for novel interventions. In consultation with her mentors, the PI has recruited a team of expert consultants to guide her in executing a research project and training plan that will provide experience essential to her goals.  The proposed study will be conducted at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry. The study focuses on late-life depression because it is prevalent and has negative outcomes. Existing treatments have low response rates and are rarely used correctly in the community due to their complexity. The project is based on the premise that focused treatments targeting biosignatures of specific neural abnormalities will have the greatest impact on clinical outcomes in late-life depression. It concentrates on positive valence systems, which are vulnerable to aging and often impaired in depression. The project will investigate positive valence systems in older adults with major depression receiving Engage, a psychotherapy designed to reactivate reward system functions. Engage has been found efficacious in late-life depression and easy to learn by community-based therapists. Consistent with RDoC methods, the proposed study will examine target engagement of Engage in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) during a 9-week course of Engage therapy, using three units of analysis to assess positive valence system function: physiology (event-related potentials), self-reports, and behavior. It will compare Engage-treated participants with 35 depressed participants, group-matched on age, receiving manualized supportive therapy. Additional analyses will assess whether low baseline positive valence function, or increases in positive valence function during treatment, predict improvement of anhedonia with Engage, and whether reward function mediates change in anhedonia.  The proposed training plan complements the research study with individualized tutorials, formal coursework, research collaborations, and manuscript preparation that will provide the PI with knowledge and skills in several areas: 1) Age-related neurobiological changes in the positive valence system and related networks; 2) Advanced statistical techniques to identify distinct neural abnormalities in depressed individuals based on their ERP profiles; and 3) Clinical trial design for psychotherapeutic interventions. The proposed project may provide important information about target engagement and mechanisms of a biologically informed, easily implemented treatment for late-life depression that has potential for dissemination. It will also provide pilot data for an R-series study using machine learning methods to predict response to Engage and will serve as an important stepping-stone for the PI as she prepares for an independent research career. Late-life depression is prevalent and devastating, and response rates to even the most effective treatments are low. Outcomes may be improved by developing targeted interventions such as Engage – a new, easily disseminated, neurobiologically informed psychotherapy for late-life depression designed to restore impaired function of the positive valence system. The proposed study will use event-related potentials and a panel of other positive valence system measures to assess target engagement in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) receiving Engage therapy, with a comparison group of 35 age-group-matched depressed peers receiving supportive therapy.",Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression,9597809,K23MH116105,"['Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuscripts', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Neurobiology', 'Opioid user', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positive Valence', 'Preparation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Stimulus', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Visual attention', 'age group', 'age related', 'base', 'biosignature', 'career', 'career development', 'comparison group', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'extrastriate', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'peer', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'sustained attention', 'trait']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2018,190334,0.03161612857846827
"Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in older adults (≥65y) is rising, and there is limited evidence-based guidance on treating these older adults. In older patients with multi-morbidity, treatment decisions should factor in not only risk of disease complications, but also treatment complications and non-IBD, extra-intestinal complications. Hence, to inform optimal treatment approach, a comprehensive assessment of comparative effects of different therapies on all of these outcomes is warranted. Existing single-center observational studies are limited by small sample size, and missing data due to fragmented health care, whereas administrative claims-based studies are limited by lack of detailed clinical data; these limitations can be overcome by linking the two data sources. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Siddharth Singh proposes to: (Aim #1.1) characterize disease burden and treatment patterns, (Aim #1.2) assess and predict risks of death, disease, treatment and extra-intestinal complications using machine-learning algorithms and (Aim #2.1) compare overall effectiveness and (Aim #2.2) safety of different treatment strategies in older patients with IBD. This will be studied using a highly innovative informatics-based approach in a multi-site, electronic medical record (EMR)-based cohort of older patients with IBD, linked to their corresponding Medicare claims. The EMR-based cohort will facilitate phenotyping and disease severity assessment, and linkage to Medicare claims will augment exposure and outcome ascertainment, overcoming challenges of fragmentation of healthcare and short follow-up. The central hypothesis is that, that older adults have systematically different risk profiles than younger adults, and using biologic monotherapy is a safer and more effective approach to treating IBD, as compared to using long-term corticosteroids alone, non-biologic immunomodulator monotherapy, and combination therapy of biologics and immunomodulators. The access to the advanced infrastructure of pSCANNER (Patient-centered Scalable National Network for Effectiveness Research), one of 13 PCORI-funded Clinical Data Research Networks, and entire Medicare database, in a highly supportive and conducive environment at UCSD, with cross-disciplinary mentorship by a collaborative and experienced team of mentors and advisors from diverse backgrounds (clinical informatics, comparative effectiveness research, IBD therapeutics) is a key strength of this application. Besides directly informing clinical practice on treatment approaches in older patients with IBD, this proposal will enhance the career of the candidate by providing unique skills in applied clinical informatics, privacy-preserving record linkage techniques, predictive analytics, and comparative effectiveness research, and create a multi-institutional, EMR- based cohort of well-characterized IBD patients, linked with Medicare claims. This will ultimately contribute to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career focusing on comparative effectiveness research and population health management using novel informatics-based approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The information on comparative effectiveness and safety of different therapies in the context of patients' risk profile generated using this novel informatics-based approach in a unique linked EMR-Medicare database, will directly inform treatment of older patients with IBD, and enhance comparative effectiveness research methods.",Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,9505175,K23DK117058,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunomodulators', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Steroids', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Thromboembolism', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health management', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'risk minimization', 'skills', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K23,2018,203872,0.05670231729779867
"The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India Project Summary/Abstract Evidence demonstrates that sleep deprivation causes impaired cognitive function and is associated with impaired health (e.g. altered immune and cardiovascular function). Yet these conclusions largely derive from correlational relationships or studies of acute sleep deprivation lasting only a few days in sleep labs. Further, research on sleep in disadvantaged populations and sleep disparities is limited, despite severe environmental challenges to sleep among the poor. Moreover, the potentially bi-directional relationship between poor sleep and poor decision-making, a possible mediator of the income-health gradient, remains largely unexplored. In short, while poor sleep could be an important contributor to health disparities and accelerated aging, we know relatively little about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This K01 application will provide key training for career advancement and begin to close this gap in knowledge. To accomplish this goal, a randomized field experiment with 400 participants, each enrolled for over one month, in Chennai, India, will (1) objectively measure sleep and key environmental factors to provide preliminary evidence on the role of environmental causes of sleep deprivation in an urban environment, (2) rigorously evaluate two simple scalable interventions to reduce sleep deprivation among low-income adults in their natural environments, (3) estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision- making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, alcohol consumption), and earnings, and (4) utilizing questions regarding sleep asked of both RCT participants and a 50,000 person nationally-representative sample, estimate the extent of sleep deprivation and its impacts more broadly in urban India. The training aims underpinning the research aims and the applicant's long-term research goals are to expand knowledge and skills in: (1) cognitive psychology and the measurement of cognitive function, (2) aging, and (3) machine learning and predictive modeling. This training, accomplished through multiple avenues including coursework, directed study, and mentorship, will directly facilitate the proposed research and extend the scope and impact of the applicant's long-term research career studying health disparities and interactions between health and decision-making which may impact both cognitive and physical health as individuals age. Notably, while this application focuses on the impacts of sleep deprivation, the potential for health to shape decision-making is much broader. Constant exposure to other aspects of poor health associated with poverty, such as pain, also have the potential to exert a mental tax, leading to impaired cognition and poor decisions. Such a negative feedback loop between these factors and decision-making has the potential to further exacerbate health disparities. The far-reaching applicability of this idea beyond the direct scope of this proposal opens the door to high public-health significance through a wide variety of channels. Project narrative Although sleep has significant potential to impair cognition and impede health, relatively little is known about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This research will begin to close this gap in knowledge through a 400 person randomized trial in Chennai, India, which will objectively and rigorously measure sleep and key environmental factors impacting sleep, evaluate the impact of two simple and scalable interventions to improve sleep, and estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision-making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, tobacco consumption), and earnings. Providing rigorous evidence on these relationships and improving our collective understanding of the causes and costs to sleep deprivation, including not just direct health outcomes, but also shifts in preferences and decision-making directly relevant to health, will provide policy-relevant information important to improving health and healthy behaviors as well as promoting heathy and economically-secure aging.",The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India,9452529,K01AG055691,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Career Mobility', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Cost Measures', 'Decision Making', 'Developing Countries', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Economic Models', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impaired health', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Insecta', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolism', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Translating', 'adverse outcome', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure reduction', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cost', 'disadvantaged population', 'discount', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'skills training', 'sleep health']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2018,127872,0.06178511820798691
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,9576319,R01AG059729,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Diet', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Freedom', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Preparation', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'ST14 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'biracial', 'caucasian American', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'disability', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fitness', 'healthy aging', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'male', 'mental state', 'microbial', 'middle age', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sarcopenia', 'walking speed', 'young adult']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,427901,0.02294027440639492
"Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study ABSTRACT Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are all highly prevalent in the US population and are associated with significant morbidity, including poor mental health, impaired neurocognitive function, metabolic dysregulation, and cardiovascular disease. In the context of the high prevalence of pernicious sleep disturbances, there is evidence that sleep disparities exist in the population, such that racial/ethnic minorities – including Mexican-Americans – are at increased risk of sleep disturbances. This is alarming, since this group is also at increased risk for many of the adverse cardiometabolic and functional outcomes linked to sleep disturbances. These associations may be influenced by economic hardship, psychosocial stress, unhealthy behaviors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and smoking), and acculturation – the degree to which an individual adopts (in this case) traditional Mexican versus American culture. The first goal of this project is to examine sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep apnea severity among Mexican-Americans and examine the role of these social-behavioral factors in this relationship. Second, this study aims to examine the role of sleep and cardiometabolic disease risk in this population and explore the role of acculturation, psychosocial stress, economic hardship, and/or unhealthy behaviors in these associations. To accomplish this, this project will partner with the Mariposa Community Health Center, the federally qualified clinic in the Nogales, AZ area. Nogales is a small city on the US/Mexico border that is an ideal location for studying non-urban Mexican- Americans, as it is made up of 83% Hispanics/Latinos, 33% immigrants, and 77% who primarily speak Spanish at home. This community-engaged project will partner with Mariposa and their Platicamos Salud program that uses experienced Community Health Workers (promotoras de salud) to collect data and perform home visits. The study will recruit N=900 Mexican-Americans and N=200 Non-Hispanic Whites to complete a battery of assessments from a clinic visit (questionnaires, interviews, exam for anthropometry and arterial stiffness, and collection of biomarkers), a 1-night home sleep apnea assessment, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and a 2-week home monitoring period with sleep diary and actigraphy. This will result in a rich dataset that can help to identify and reduce sleep disparities in the population and point to potential intervention approaches to reducing cardiometabolic disease disparities. The analytic plan will take advantage of a machine-learning analytic approach, which will be used to evaluate the complex relationships among all of these variables. This project will address many relevant issues in sleep medicine, health disparities research, and border health. The partnership with Mariposa will enhance recruitment, promote research integrity (or ensure appropriateness of research methods), and facilitate dissemination of the study results into the community through education programs associated with Platicamos Salud and other community outreach efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The primary goal of this study is to assess sleep health among Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border, characterize relationships with cardiometabolic disease risk, and investigate the role of social-environmental factors including acculturation, stress, socioeconomics, and health behaviors. Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are highly prevalent in the population. These conditions are associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, daytime functioning problems, and poor mental health. Disparities in sleep health in racial/ethnic minorities exist, including Mexican-Americans. In particular, social-environmental factors at the US-Mexico border may play an important role in sleep health disparities. This project will not only allow for increased understanding of the complex relationship among sleep, health, and social-environmental pressures, but through a community partnership it can maximize our ability to reduce these disparities. Also, this project has the added benefit of providing information about the role of sleep as a potentially modifiable factor in cardiovascular disease and diabetes disparities as well.",Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study,9523633,R01MD011600,"['Acculturation', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Community Health Aides', 'Community Health Centers', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Hour', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Latino', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Metabolic', 'Mexican', 'Mexican Americans', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cardiometabolism', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'caucasian American', 'community partnership', 'diaries', 'diet and exercise', 'disorder risk', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'food security', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'low density lipoprotein triglyceride', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'pressure', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'sample collection', 'sleep health', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2018,772060,0.05738016674926186
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9559625,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2018,156568,0.07221116368957328

recording, 71% listen and 68% share it with a caregiver, resulting in improved understanding and self-­ management. Yet, unstructured recordings are difficult to navigate. Personal health libraries (PHLs) may help

project is to develop a PHL that integrates clinic audio-­recordings (Audio-­PHL), using data science methods to  link medical terms from the recording to trustworthy patient resources, which can be retrieved, organized,  edited and shared by patients. The specific aims are: Aim 1 Identify health information seeking needs and  strategies of older adults with multimorbidity and caregivers;; Aim 2 Develop an Audio-­PHL using data science  methods to securely analyze clinic visit recordings and make this information accessible and understandable  for patients;; and Aim 3 Demonstrate the usability and use of an Audio-­PHL in older adults with multimorbidity  and caregivers. Applicants hypothesize: (1) The Audio-­PHL will surpass acceptable usability metrics in older  adults and caregivers and (2) natural language processing (NLP) methods developed for the Audio-­PHL will  accurately identify key visit information (e.g. medication) and connect it to credible patient resources. The  development of the Audio-­PHL follows a user centered design model. In Aim 1, the applicants will use  participatory design activities with 48 end-­users to inform Audio-­PHL design. In Aim 2, the Audio-­PHL will be  created in iterative cycles informed by findings from Aim 1. In Aim 3, extensive usability evaluation will be  conducted in human computer interaction (HCI) laboratory settings to ensure Audio-­PHL surpasses acceptable

"A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults Abstract  People aged 65+ will represent 21% of the U.S. population and increase to about 80 million by 2040, and the oldest old (age 85+) will number ~ 14.1 million. Population aging presents both opportunities and challenges for our healthcare, the economy, and existing social support systems. Many older adults especially the oldest old, minorities and those of lower Socio-Economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, poor diet, and decreased levels of physical activity each of which influence morbidity and mortality. Mobile-based, tablet-based, and in-home technologies provide an excellent opportunity for projecting behavior- change interventions and social support into the everyday life of older adults at great economies of scale. The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system, designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2) the Fittle+ mobile platform designed to support positive health behavior change through integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence (AI). The study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1 we will develop and pilot test the FSS with representative samples of older adults. Phase 2 will involve a two group randomized trial where participants will be randomized to the Fittle Senior System (FSS, an adaptive coaching and social support system using mobile technology) or to a paper-based psycho-educational (BPE) control condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at risk for social isolation (90 per condition - 30 White Caucasians, 30 Black/African Americans and 30 Hispanic Americans). We will recruit males and females commensurate to the gender proportions represented in this age group and work to ensure that we have sufficient representation from the “oldest old” cohort. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on clinically significant measures of health and health behaviors and indices of social support. We will also gather information on potential moderating (e.g., ethnicity, age) and mediating variables (e.g., health self-efficacy), which will be examined using multilevel modeling techniques guided by current theories of behavior change and technology acceptance and use among older adults. Project Narrative This proposed project is addressing a critical public concern. The population is aging and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are common among older adults especially ethnic minorities. This study will develop and evaluate a mobile technology-based intervention designed to support positive health behavior change among diverse older adults through integrated online social support, personalized coaching and goal setting.",A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults,9708683,R01AG053163,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caucasians', 'Chronic', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Industry', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Jordan', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Support System', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'active method', 'age group', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinically significant', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'dynamic system', 'education research', 'efficacy trial', 'ethnic minority population', 'family structure', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'low socioeconomic status', 'male', 'medical schools', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'nutrition', 'programs', 'psychoeducational', 'psychoeducational intervention', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2018,589098,0.04272646449670042
"A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research Summary/Abstract This project will construct a Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (IPUMS-MLP) of unprecedented scale and scope. Using cutting-edge automatic record linkage technology and drawing on complete count U.S. census data available from IPUMS for the period 1850 to 1940, the project will construct millions of individual life histories and trace millions of families over multiple generations. This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,9594032,R01AG057679,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Demographic Transitions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Genealogy', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immigration', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Mission', 'Names', 'Neighborhoods', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Process', 'Public Policy', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Social Processes', 'Social Security', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Urbanization', 'War', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive capacity', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'economic outcome', 'experience', 'health economics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'life history', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,695826,-0.0003934001384400128
"Working Memory Training in Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that cognitive interventions targeting working memory are beneficial in that they show generalizing effects that go beyond what has been specifically trained, i.e. transfer effects. Although it seems more difficult to observe such transfer effects in older adults as compared to young adults or children, we and others have found that some interventions do show promise in older populations. Despite the promising results, more research is needed to make our interventions more effective and more robust, and to uncover the underlying mechanisms of training in an aging population. For our proposed studies, we envision two lines of research with different goals: First, we aim to address questions of pragmatics. Our goal here is to make our intervention more accessible and inviting for participants, thus increasing their motivation to participate effectively in training regimens. In addition, we will investigate the intervention's optimal scheduling (i.e., spacing of practice), and explore whether the improvements extend to measures of everyday functioning, and finally, investigate longitudinal effects and their trajectories over the course of one year after training completion. These are our applied goals. Second, we propose to address the most important questions of any intervention research: The investigation of the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of improvement. Furthermore, we will shed light on individual differences as moderating factors for training success. These are our mechanistic goals. Given the sparse availability of effective cognitive interventions, and the limited knowledge about their generalizing effects to applied measures of daily living, the proposed work will have important implications in that it will shed more light on the mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in old age, and serve as groundwork for future large-scale randomized clinical trials and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The vast majority of our nation's aging population will experience some decline in cognitive function with age. Therefore, the development of effective preventative interventions to mitigate age-related cognitive decline is of critical importance in that those interventions could not only impact older adults' cognitive and daily life functioning, but ultimately, contribute to their well-being and quality of life. The proposed work will have important implications in that it will get at the underlying mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in ld age, and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted cognitive interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia.",Working Memory Training in Older Adults,9507749,R01AG049006,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Financial compensation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Motivation', 'Older Population', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Self Efficacy', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specificity', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'active control', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'improved', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2018,618627,0.008113992544201342
"A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of adults age � 65 years have high blood pressure (BP), but optimal management of high BP in the elderly remains controversial. Contrary to evidence in middle age that lowering BP is clearly beneficial, data in older adults are inconsistent and high BP may not be a risk factor in all elders. We recently reported that, among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey age e65 years, high BP was a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death only among persons in better health status (defined as fast walking of a 20-ft walk test). In contrast, high BP was not a risk factor among slow walkers. Additionally, the benefit of lowering BP in all elders remains an issue of debate; a recent meta-analysis in persons age 80 years and older reported no benefit of BP treatment on mortality, and significant heterogeneity across trials. Finally, there is growin concern for potential harms associated with treatment to lower BP. Excessive lowering of BP, particularly diastolic, has been associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in some studies. In the proposed research, we propose a novel paradigm where the associations of BP with adverse outcomes in older persons are considered in the setting of the complex aging process. Our long-term goal is to reliably identify elderly persons in whom BP treatment is beneficial and those in whom treatment is ineffective or even harmful, by defining subpopulations of similar health status. Specifically, aim 1 proposes to elucidate factors from four domains (functional, cognitive/mental, self-rated health, and physiologic) that can identify elderly persons in whom high systolic BP is strongly associated with higher risk for death and CV events, and those in whom it is not, using data from three NIH-funded cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) and Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA). In aim 2, we will evaluate the role of diastolic BP across level of health status. Finally, based on findings from these observational cohorts, in aim 3 we will evaluate whether these factors can identify elderly persons in whom treatment to lower BP is of maximum benefit in two randomized controlled trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SHEP) and the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3). Since participants in trials are healthier than the U.S. population, we will also evaluate the effect of treatment in the observational studies, using state-of-the-art causal inference methods, which can correct for the bias of standard analytic approaches. Completion of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the importance of high BP in older adults; will improve our ability to identify elderly persons who will benefit from BP treatment; will allow a systematic understanding of groups in whom evidence for BP treatment is lacking; and will guide design of future trials of hypertension in elderly adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Treatment of high blood pressure in elderly persons remains controversial. This proposal focuses on developing systematic methods to understand which elderly persons benefit from lowering blood pressure.

"Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) to provide cognitive training, in the form of learning to play the piano, to improve cognitive functioning and reduce feelings of loneliness in socially-isolated older adults. The SAR will administer cognitive training via guided practice on a set of standard piano lesson tasks designed to reflect particular cognitive functions: memory, attention, language, and social acuity. The goals of this project are that the SAR will (1) engage the persons with mild cognitive impairment (PMCI) in skill-building cognitive music training; (2) enhance cognitive functioning, in particular verbal and visual memory, reasoning ability, and complex attention; and (3) reduce feelings of loneliness. This SAR can be used as both a personalized social companion and an interactive tutor to deliver customized training for cognitive functioning and social engagement. We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, roboticists, engineers, human factors specialists, neuroscientists, and gerontologists, well suited to achieve goals. Project Narrative Dementia is a costly chronic disease; an estimated $259 billion was spent in 2017 for health care, long-term care, and out-of-pocket expenses. Furthermore, social isolation is a problem many older adults face, with 1 in 3 older adults reporting loneliness in the United States. Socially assistive robotics (SARs) have the potential to provide mental and social engagement – especially for those older adults who may lack social connections. In particular, SARs can utilize machine learning to provide customized and socially-engaging cognitive training for lonely older adults with MCI.",Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,9620766,R42AG060800,"['Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Esthetics', 'Face', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Loneliness', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Music', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Reporting', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Specialist', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Uninsured Medical Expense', 'United States', 'aged', 'body language', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive training', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'preference', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'robot assistance', 'robot interface', 'sensory integration', 'skills', 'social', 'social engagement', 'tutoring', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'visual memory', 'web app']",NIA,APPLIED UNIVERSAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION,R42,2018,347146,0.045410478305810714
"Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality Abstract Older adults struggle to engage in health enhancing physical activity (PA) and spend up to 11 hours a day sitting. Older women, in particular, are at increased risk of chronic disease and disability, and use a high proportion of healthcare resources. Improving both these behaviors has promise for improving several salient aging outcomes, but evidence to inform guidelines on how best to interrupt long periods of sedentary behavior (SB) are lacking. Few laboratory-based trials have included adults over 70 years old, have focused on PA to interrupt SB, and have not tested standing breaks that might be acceptable to older adults. A recent review showed that in the real world, traditional PA interventions do not meaningfully impact SB. In contrast, interventions that focus on standing can reduce SB, up to 2 hours per day. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between self-reported SB and increased risks of death and metabolic outcomes, but very few prospective studies have employed objective measures of SB. Although accelerometer measures can indicate the intensity of movement or lack of it, traditional cutpoints do not accurately classify behaviors such as sitting, standing or walking. While pilot intervention studies, using thigh worn inclinometers, have demonstrated that SB can be greatly reduced, there are no RCTs in older adults with health outcomes. There is much room for improvement in our understanding of SB and healthy aging. The National Institute on Aging conducted a summer workshop series to address this issue in 2013. We have therefore designed a Program project – Sedentary Time and Aging Research (STAR) – to provide more rigorous and comprehensive evidence on how to interrupt sitting time and the consequences for healthy aging. In particular, we are proposing a paradigm shift away from energy expenditure as the primary mechanism for health outcomes to investigating behaviors such as brief sit-to-stand transitions that expend little energy but engage muscles, improve postural blood flow, and may impact physical functioning in older adults. Further, we will study a broader range of outcomes than investigated to date, including targeted novel mechanisms important for healthy aging. The STAR program will include 3 Projects and 2 Cores for study of postmenopausal women at risk for chronic disease. STAR includes 2 randomized trials, in the laboratory (N=86) and in the real world (N=592), with focus on optimizing new computational techniques to apply to existing prospective accelerometer data (n>6000). All projects will investigate the consequences of extended sitting, standing, brief sit-to-stand transitions and PA breaks on mechanisms of healthy aging including glucose regulation, endothelial functioning, and mitochondrial functioning. We will also investigate physical functioning, blood pressure and in Project 3, 5-7 year mortality risk. All Projects will compare effects across age groups. STAR will provide a comprehensive evidence base that can inform public health guidelines on SB and aging. We will coordinate our efforts with a new American Heart Association Center on SB and Latinas.  Narrative Sitting time may be particularly bad for the health of older women. This program grant will provide new and improved evidence to help the public understand how to interrupt sitting in ways that support healthy aging.  ","Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality",9519753,P01AG052352,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Computational Technique', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Latina', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Postmenopause', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'age effect', 'age group', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'disability', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'response biomarker', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P01,2018,1880890,0.06990346436444829
"Pre-clinic model for sleep deprivation-induced obesity and hedonic intake due to noise exposure Easy access to calories and poor sleep independently increase eating and weight gain. Sleep deprivation (SD) increases hedonic intake (eating palatable food for pleasure) and in humans environmental noise exposure causes SD, is detrimental to health and increases obesity risk. We have shown that noise (pre-recorded random city sounds) causes SD, hyperphagia and weight gain in male rats, which is novel and replicates human data. Yet this methodology must be established in female rodents as sex is a critical biological variable. The overall goal is to establish the method of SD by noise to induce obesity in female rodents, use the model to define the contribution of hedonic intake to SD-induced obesity and use these data to develop a non- invasive method to distinguish types of sleep (REM vs. non-REM). Aim 1 will use statistical learning methods and data mining to quantify REM and non-REM based on data collected from studies in this proposal (food intake, physical activity energy expenditure, EEG, EMG) and will establish SD by noise in females as a pre- clinical model for obesity due to SD. We will compare sleep disruption caused by noise exposure and the gentle handling technique; test whether sex moderates the effect of noise exposure on sleep, weight gain and food intake and whether Suvorexant (used clinically for insomnia) normalizes sleep in noise-exposed rats. Finally, data mining will be completed to address a critical need in the sleep field: to develop a high-throughput, non-invasive technique to distinguish REM vs. non-REM in rats. In humans, SD increases hedonic intake, which promotes obesity. Taste preference is highly variable and may modulate hedonic intake caused by SD. We show clear individual taste preferences for snacks using a cafeteria (CAF) diet protocol (i.e. rotating selection of palatable human snacks plus rodent chow ad lib). We also show SD by noise increases chocolate intake in sated rats with low initial preference for chocolate and maintains intake in rats with high preference. Thus, SD by noise may increase intake of palatable foods that would normally be avoided during adequate sleep. Aim 2 will test if the effects of SD by noise on hedonic intake and obesity are dependent upon sex and individual taste preferences in rats. We will test whether SD increases binge chocolate intake and intake of CAF diet snacks. The scientific premise is: SD in increases hedonic intake and promotes obesity in humans; environmental noise promotes SD in humans; and our pre-clinical model mirrors the human response to SD. We hypothesize that like male rats, SD due to noise will cause obesity in females and increase hedonic intake despite individual preference to in turn worsen obesity. The innovation lies in establishing a simple method of SD that replicates human SD-induced obesity; developing a non-surgical method to measure sleep types; and identifying how individual preferences affects hedonic intake and obesity caused by SD. Its significance lies in establishing a translational model of SD independent of sex to identify mechanisms underlying reward behavior and obesity propensity due to SD, with the ultimate goal of developing novel anti-obesity therapies. The goal of these studies is to establish our method of sleep deprivation by environmental noise to induce obesity, and use this model to define the contribution of hedonic intake to obesity due to sleep deprivation in humans. Studies will employ a novel method of partial sleep deprivation by noise, which mimics weight gain in sleep deprived humans. We propose to establish sleep deprivation by noise in females rats, as we have shown in males, as a pre-clinical model for obesity due to sleep deprivation, develop a non-invasive method to distinguish REM from non-REM sleep based on food intake, physical activity, energy expenditure, EEG and EMG data, in lieu of EEG/EMG recordings, and define the effects of sleep deprivation by noise on hedonic intake and its influence on obesity in males and female rats. Completing these studies will provide a valid translational pre-clinical model of sleep deprivation to identify how sleep deprivation alters reward behavior, eating and obesity propensity, with the ultimate goal of developing new therapies against obesity.",Pre-clinic model for sleep deprivation-induced obesity and hedonic intake due to noise exposure,9525441,R21NS099468,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Welfare', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body Weight', 'Calories', 'Chocolate', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Electroencephalography', 'Energy Intake', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperphagia', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Middle Insomnia', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'REM Sleep', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleeplessness', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Study models', 'Taste preferences', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'adequate sleep', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'data mining', 'defined contribution', 'experience', 'feeding', 'food consumption', 'hedonic', 'human data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'noise pollution', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'obesity risk', 'pleasure', 'preference', 'response', 'sex', 'sleep quality', 'sound', 'translational model', 'urban area']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2018,188446,0.031000439547574837
"Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults (AD/ADRD-Focused Administrative Supplement) Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults: AD/ADRD-Focused  Administrative Supplement Summary Dementia affects over 5 million older adults in the US, with vast implications for individual patients, their caregivers, and social programs designed to support increasing health care needs. Research to date has not fully clarified the role that multiple co-occurring chronic conditions (multimorbidity) play in the provision of appropriate care for racially and ethnically diverse groups of older adults with mild or more severe cognitive impairment. As a result, there is a need for greater understanding of the complex interactions between existing morbidity combinations, cognitive impairment, and the receipt of essential and appropriate care. As of yet, it is unclear whether specific multimorbidity combinations alongside cognitive impairment present greater difficulty in accessing good-quality, and appropriate care and preventive services among older adults from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds. The supplement extends from the research conducted in the parent award by focusing on older adults with cognitive impairment or dementia and co-existing chronic conditions. The goal of this supplement is to evaluate racial and ethnic differences in the quality of care received for older adults with dementia and competing multimorbidity care demands. We propose to use existing databases and multimorbidity combinations and patterns recently found in the parent grant. Our proposed research employs data from over 20 years of nationally-representative biennial surveys (~38,000 sampled people in the Health & Retirement Study) linked to Medicare claims. We propose two aims:  Aim 1. Determine racial and ethnic differences in receipt of preventive services among older adults with  mild or severe cognitive impairment and various multimorbidity combinations.  Aim 2. Evaluate racial and ethnic differences in potentially avoidable hospital admissions and  emergency department (ED) visits with discharge among older adults with mild or severe cognitive  impairment and various multimorbidity patterns. Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults: AD/ADRD-Focused  Administrative Supplement Narrative Our findings will inform policies and programs that seek to delay and avert costly and intensive levels of care among racially/ethnically diverse older adults with dementia. By identifying disease combinations with dementia associated with poor uptake of preventive services and high use of preventable hospital and emergency department services, future work can inform treatment decision-making and practice guidelines that are better attuned to the needs of vulnerable older adults with mild and severe cognitive decline.",Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults (AD/ADRD-Focused Administrative Supplement),9716886,R01AG055681,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Institutionalization', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preventive service', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic diversity', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'parent grant', 'premature', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'racial diversity', 'sex', 'social', 'tool', 'trend', 'uptake']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,373593,0.06476189771107291
"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults.

The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years.

"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9423915,R01AG057704,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Certificates', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hand', 'Handwriting', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Resources', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immigrant', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infant', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maiden Name', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Minnesota', 'Minority Groups', 'Names', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Price', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Science', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Toxin', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'early-life nutrition', 'ethnic minority population', 'frontier', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mortality', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'population health', 'population survey', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'suicide rate']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,325845,0.010009847626514315
"Technology-Enabled Therapy for Elders with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Co-morbid Insomnia Abstract Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often viewed as a transitional stage between normal aging and early stage of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia. MCI affects up to 20% of the population of older adults, and sleep disturbances have been identified as one of the core neuropsychiatric problems in MCI. Sleep disturbances are associated with a range of negative outcomes for persons with MCI, including worsening cognitive function, physical function, depression, and fatigue, which can all lead to functional impairments that greatly reduce quality of life. One of the most common sleep disturbances in persons with MCI is insomnia, with a prevalence of 44%. While non-pharmacological treatments, especially in-person cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI), have demonstrated clinical efficacy in improving sleep and preserving cognitive function in the general population of older adults, there have been few studies focused on adapting CBTI for older adults with MCI.  The goal of this SBIR Phase I is to develop and test a provider-supported, technology-enabled system to adapt and deliver evidence-based CBTI to persons with MCI and co-morbid insomnia, with the support of health providers. The proposed intervention combines internet/mobile-based delivery and smart messaging prompts as reminders to compensate for cognitive processes that can be impaired in MCI. Specific aims for this Phase I include: (1) Develop a technology-enabled system to deliver CBTI for older adults with MCI; (2) Conduct formative evaluations with persons with MCI to refine smart messaging prompts and test usability of the patient software platform, and cognitive interviews with providers to assess feasibility of implementing the intervention in the clinical setting; and (3) Conduct a six-week pilot randomized controlled trial to assess preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of the CBTI intervention. We hypothesize that participants in the CBTI intervention group will demonstrate a significant improvement in quality of sleep (both subjective and objective), and an improvement in cognitive and physical functioning, compared to those in the control group.  Data collected in Phase I will be used to determine the sample size necessary for an adequately powered Phase II randomized trial. If successful, this product will contribute to the adoption and dissemination of a low-cost, multi-technology enabled CBTI intervention to reduce sleep disturbances, and improve cognitive and physical function among persons with MCI. A successful Phase II study will result in a technology-enabled program that can benefit multiple types of provider organizations (mental health clinics, primary care clinics, and geriatric clinics) serving large numbers of older adults with MCI, thus having significant commercial potential. Narrative More than 5 million people in the United States suffer from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with over 44% of them experiencing insomnia. Given the negative outcomes associated with MCI and co-morbid insomnia, there is strong interest in developing non-pharmacological treatments for improving sleep in this population of older adults. The proposed project provides a technology-enabled system that is designed to adapt cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) for older adults with MCI. Combining emerging innovative technologies with evidence-based practice, the proposed CBTI intervention system has the potential to be deployed by multiple provider organizations, including mental health clinics, primary care clinics, geriatric clinics, and home care agencies, potentially benefiting millions of older adults in the U.S. who have MCI and co-morbid sleep problems.",Technology-Enabled Therapy for Elders with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Co-morbid Insomnia,9622670,R43AG058334,"['Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Columbidae', 'Communication', 'Comorbid Insomnia', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Eagles', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Evidence based practice', 'Fatigue', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Agencies', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modification', 'Motivation', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Sample Size', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'formative assessment', 'functional disability', 'group intervention', 'human old age (65+)', 'hypnotic', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'normal aging', 'older patient', 'phase 2 study', 'preference', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'sleep onset', 'sleep quality', 'software systems', 'treatment response', 'usability']",NIA,"ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH GROUP, INC.",R43,2018,224844,0.07182573502439259
"Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health PROJECT SUMMARY Nearly 10% of Americans practice meditation to improve health. Randomized controlled trials support this practice and show that mindfulness training is effective in improving a broad range of health outcomes. In particular, mindfulness training has been shown to reduce biomarkers of systemic inflammation that contribute to the pathophysiology of disease and predict risk for all-cause mortality. Still, little is known about the biological processes linking mindfulness training with inflammation. This proposal tests the hypothesis that mindfulness training aids the regulation of inflammation by mitigating glucocorticoid resistance (GCR). GCR is a leading candidate mechanism linking psychosocial threat with systemic inflammation. Whereas cortisol released in response to threat normally binds to glucocorticoid receptors and down-regulates inflammation, chronic perceptions of threat lead to a state of GCR, in which glucocorticoid receptors become insensitive to the anti-inflammatory effects of circulating cortisol. Mindfulness training is proposed to diminish perceptions of threat in ways that restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. To test this biological pathway, this study assesses functional GCR and biomarkers of inflammation before and after a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or control Health Enhancement Program (HEP) in a sample of lonely older adults (N=188). Loneliness is a form of chronic psychosocial threat, and is consistently associated with GCR and systemic inflammation, yet MBSR is one of very few interventions successful in reducing loneliness. MBSR is expected to decrease GCR (and restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity) compared to HEP from pre- to post- intervention. Moreover, these decreases in GCR are expected to mediate the effects of MBSR (vs. HEP) on lowering systemic inflammation (CRP and IL-6) from pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up. In sum, this proposal investigates decreased GCR as a biological mechanism through which mindfulness training reduces inflammatory disease risk. It addresses NCCIH's call for research on understanding the biological mechanisms of action underlying mind-body intervention approaches and complements NCCIH's special interest in alleviating inflammatory processes. The knowledge gained from this research will contribute to a better understanding of the basic biological pathways underlying mindfulness practices, which may help to identify and target populations likely to benefit from mindfulness training. The research and training plan described in this application provide opportunities for the applicant to develop a knowledge base and methodology in psychoneuroimmunology, learn statistical techniques for analyzing complex mechanistic pathways, and develop the professional skills necessary for a successful career testing biological and psychological mechanisms underlying mind-body interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mindfulness meditation practices are widely used to alleviate physical symptoms, and growing evidence suggests that mindfulness training may reduce systemic inflammation, but less is known about the biological pathways linking mindfulness training with inflammatory processes. The proposed project investigates a biological mechanism, glucocorticoid sensitivity, to explain how mindfulness training lowers inflammation among lonely older adults who are at risk for multiple inflammatory diseases. From a public health perspective, clarifying this mechanistic pathway will help to identify who is likely to show health benefits from mindfulness training.",Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health,9561883,F32AT009508,"['Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood Circulation', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Dexamethasone', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Feeling', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Immune', 'Immunology procedure', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meditation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Mind-Body Intervention', 'Mindfulness Training', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychoneuroimmunology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy trial', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'falls', 'feasibility trial', 'follow-up', 'health training', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mindfulness meditation', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'physical symptom', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'receptor function', 'receptor sensitivity', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'successful intervention', 'training aid', 'training opportunity']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2018,63154,0.011574238125944818
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Mentorship in the Endocrinology of Sleep The overarching goal of this application for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to foster training of promising junior investigators in cutting edge patient-oriented research related to how sleep biology influences cardiometabolic health. It capitalizes on the established network and resources of the recently renewed UCLA CTSI that includes a highly successful KL2 program. Dr. Liu led a competitively- funded Endocrine and Cardiometabolic Program in Sleep Biology at the University of Sydney, and since 2012, he has led a similar interdisciplinary research program in Los Angeles supported by a 5 year NHLBI R01 “Hormonal mechanisms of sleep restriction” that is currently in its 3rd year. During his 10 years of mentoring, he has trained 16 individuals: 10 remaining in academic medicine and 2 others in industry-related patient orientated research. Three of his trainees won major US young investigator awards under his supervision. He continues to support, mentor, and publish with former trainees, often long after they left his laboratory.  Disturbed sleep causes insulin resistance, promotes poor food choices, and curtails fat loss while dieting, thereby reducing the effectiveness of standard weight loss programs. However, the cardiometabolic consequences of disturbed sleep are not well recognized by the community, and the evidential bases to justify widespread changes to community sleeping patterns for cardiometabolic health reasons are evolving. Showing the mechanisms by which sleep restriction leads to cardiometabolic ill-health, particularly in older adults according to sex, are critical steps in providing these data. Dr. Liu's goal is to mentor the next cadre of independent clinical scientists focused on placing sleep alongside diet and exercise as part of healthy lifestyle, by understanding hormonal mechanisms and consequences of disrupted, inadequate or misaligned sleep.  The work proposed in this application fulfill these goals. Aim 1 will reveal the hypothalmo-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal mechanisms that cause testosterone-cortisol imbalance when sleep is restricted in older men and women (20 in each group). In doing so, trainees will learn endocrine physiology and chronobiological study design, IRB processes, recruitment skills, and hands-on study management. Aim 2 will identify sex differences in these mechanisms, trainees will learn statistical methods and abstract/presentation/ manuscript preparation. Aim 3 requires trainees to discover new mechanisms by which sleep restriction causes insulin resistance and alters appetite or food intake. Certain inflammatory mediators, hormones, or factors related to ethnicity or age could be studied. Aim 3 fulfils broader expectations for trainees to have a second project that is faster to accomplish, more exploratory, and driven by their interests and available resources, to develop a line of research that complements and is separate from that of the mentors. Taken together, these experiments will generate new knowledge of the relationship between sleep and hormonal cardiometabolic and reproductive health, provide wide-ranging training opportunities, and generate future R and K proposals. Narrative Insufficient sleep is common, and leads to insulin resistance, a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This proposal attempts to reveal the hormonal mechanisms underlying the link between insufficient sleep with insulin resistance in older adults, the population at greatest risk for disordered sleep and metabolic disorders as a vehicle to provide outstanding mentorship opportunities.",Mentorship in the Endocrinology of Sleep,9522654,K24HL138632,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Award', 'Biology', 'Carbohydrates', 'Catabolism', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Corticotropin', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Cosyntropin', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Physiology', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gonadal structure', 'Gonadotropin Hormone Releasing Hormone', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone imbalance', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Hunger', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Infusion procedures', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Ketoconazole', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicine', 'Menopause', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Osteoporosis', 'Ovary', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Statistical Methods', 'Steroid biosynthesis', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virulence Factors', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'bone age', 'cardiometabolism', 'diabetes risk', 'diet and exercise', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'ganirelix', 'healthy lifestyle', 'hormonal signals', 'insulin sensitivity', 'interest', 'male', 'men', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'older men', 'older women', 'patient oriented research', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'sex', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'training opportunity', 'weight loss program', 'young adult']",NHLBI,LUNDQUIST INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION AT HARBOR-UCLA MEDICAL CENTER,K24,2018,119586,0.06618808104644218
"Web-based App to Alleviate Loneliness and Isolation in Older Adults at Home ABSTRACT Loneliness contributes to physical and psychological chronic illnesses, functional decline and mortality in older adults. The fast-growing older population coupled with the worsening shortage of caregivers will soon present our nation with severe societal and economic challenges. Older adults often struggle to maintain quality of life and independence in the presence of chronic diseases and isolation. Socialization has been shown to reduce chronic disease, depression, and to improve quality of life in older adults. Motivation and feedback are essential to continued engagement but doing so through the traditional manner of in-person coaching can be prohibitively expensive. Vigorous Mind (VM) has been providing a web-based platform to promote sustained engagement of older adults primarily in groups in senior living facilities. The platform provides dynamic and tailored content for group activities including reminiscence activities, favorite music and video, adaptive computer games and communication. A new mobile app will be developed to enable older adults at home to connect and participate in group activities in senior centers and independent senior living communities. With the help of the Consortium on Technology for Proactive Care, we will enhance the current VM system with a health coach with automated tailored messaging and incentives for continued engagement and adherence. This will optimize the VM system for home-based deployment, thus expanding the reach and impact of VM to potentially delay or even prevent institutionalization among older adults living independently. There is a compelling need for a tool that can alleviate loneliness and increase older adults’ socialization to reduce chronic disease, depression and decline and to improve quality of life in this fast-growing population. The proposed integrated web-based platform represents the first step in the development of environments that combine human and machine intelligence in order to facilitate socialization for older adults and to enhance their quality of life.",Web-based App to Alleviate Loneliness and Isolation in Older Adults at Home,9678301,R43AG061928,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Independent Living', 'Institutionalization', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Local Government', 'Loneliness', 'Mental Depression', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Music', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Rewards', 'Services', 'Site', 'Socialization', 'State Government', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'community living', 'computer game', 'design', 'functional decline', 'improved', 'instructor', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'tailored messaging', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,"VIGOROUS MIND, INC.",R43,2018,220511,0.11346713371888338
"Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM) Abstract for Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM) Hypertension is prevalent among older adults. Hypertension increases risk for stroke and myocardial infarction, and can result in end organ damage to the kidneys, retina and brain. Medication adherence is critically important to prevent the deleterious effects of hypertension; yet, adherence is often calculated at only 50%. We developed and tested the Multifaceted Prospective Memory Intervention (MPMI), a behavioral intervention, using theories of prospective memory and aging to improve adherence to antihypertensive medications. The MPMI was tested among older adults (≥ 65 years of age) and improved adherence by 35%. The MPMI was efficacious over the short term, but after an additional 5 months without the ongoing presence of the interventionists, adherence declined. The purpose of the current study is to create an evidence-based smartphone application and companion website in order to provide continuous use of the efficacious strategies to sustain adherence. We are at an exciting time since among persons with hypertension the potential benefits of improved health can be achieved through improved adherence. The recent SPRINT study (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) supports improved outcomes (lower fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause) by targeting a lower systolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg compared to using the previously recommended guideline of 140 mm Hg.2 These outcomes will not be achieved unless we can help people take their medications as prescribed and as intended. Specifically using iterative usability, cognitive walk-through and heuristic evaluation, we will build, test and modify a mobile application (App) and companion website, the Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM). Mobile devices are ubiquitous and can be leveraged to capture the prospective memory strategies and improve adherence. The development of the MEDSReM will be based on the strategies from the MPMI, human factors in aging, preferences, needs and requirements of older adults taking medications using technology and iterative testing to assure usability for older adults. The strategies will be translated to technology and add decision support. Decision support will provide the patient with assistance in taking medications if they have missed a dose. A decision tree will be created with knowledge of pharmacotherapeutic and pharmacokinetics based on the patient's medication time to peak, duration and half-life properties to determine a safe interval for taking missed doses. The final MEDSReM will include a website that can easily be accessed with links in the App for educational support and ongoing coaching. Taking a human factors approach to inform the preferences, needs and requirements for technological support to take medications as intended, and iterative testing for usability of the App and website among older adults, will result in a superior product for the mobile App and website and improve health outcomes. This final product will be field tested and consequent improvement in adherence assessed. Public Health Significance High blood pressure is common among older adults and can lead to poor health including the increased likelihood of stroke and heart disease. Adhering to medications that lower blood pressure is difficult, particularly among older adults who have been shown to experience age-associated declines in cognitive processes that could support medication taking. A previously tested intervention was successful in improving adherence. The aim of this study is to translate the intervention into mobile technology with the goal of sustaining good adherence.","Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM)",9469571,R21NR016285,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Companions', 'Consult', 'Cues', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Financial cost', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Half-Life', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Memory Loss', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Self Management', 'Self-Administered', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'blood pressure intervention', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'field study', 'handheld mobile device', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'memory process', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'post intervention', 'preference', 'prevent', 'prospective memory', 'prototype', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'successful intervention', 'theories', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2018,153500,0.06374593471750399
"Frailty, Statins, and Cardiovascular Disease Burden in Older Adults Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in older adults. Statins are highly effective cholesterol-lowering medications used for primary prevention of CVD, and are the most commonly prescribed medications. After age 75, data on the effects of statins are limited to guide statin prescribing recommendations. However, even where the evidence is clear, statins remain under-prescribed. Reasons for under-prescribing of proven CVD prevention medications such as statins in older adults are many, and may include competing medical conditions, adverse side effects (e.g., myalgias), and frailty. Frailty is a multidimensional state of decreased physiologic reserve associated with an increased risk of CVD and poor clinical outcomes. The aging population is heterogeneous and a one-size fits all approach may not be appropriate. In particular, understanding the utility of statins for prevention of CVD in individuals who are vulnerable or frail is critical. Therefore, the research activities in this GEMSSTAR award will use a retrospective design to (1) understand patterns of statin use in a large cohort of older US veterans aged 65 and older, over 15 years of follow up, with particular attention to the relationship between frailty, myalgias and statin use; and (2) examine the association between statin use for primary prevention of CVD in pre-frail and frail older veterans and cardiovascular events, health care utilization, and mortality. This work will inform the design of future clinical trials of statins for prevention of CVD in older adults accounting for heterogeneity of aging and frailty. In addition to the pharmacoepidemiologic study proposed, this GEMSSTAR award includes mentorship, coursework, and seminars in advanced epidemiologic and statistical methods, geriatrics, and cardiology. The research and career development activities will prepare the applicant for her long-term goal of a research career in geriatric preventive cardiology and will inform preventive care for the aging population. As the population ages, identifying preventive strategies for heart disease and stroke is a priority. However, proven preventive medications such as the cholesterol-lowering statins remain underused. In this study, we aim to understand patterns of statin use in older adults to shed light on why statins may be underused even where evidence is clear, and to examine whether statins are useful in preventing heart disease and stroke in older adults who are vulnerable or frail.","Frailty, Statins, and Cardiovascular Disease Burden in Older Adults",9589859,R03AG060169,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Frail Elderly', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Medical', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myalgia', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive therapy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'aging population', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'prevent', 'research and development', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R03,2018,96525,0.0643572291555826
"Scriptmate: A patient-centered mobile system for geriatric prescription medication management PROJECT SUMMARY Elderly patients are the largest consumers of prescription and non-prescription medications and have been reported to account for $887 million in treatment costs for medication errors likely due to altered pharmacokinetics, polypharmacy, decline in cognition, and lower health literacy. As a result of this confluence of issues that affect the aging population, medication management tools designed to accommodate the particular needs of older adults can be greatly beneficial. While there have been many advances made in mobile health technologies to assist with aspects of medication management such as adherence reminders and access to drug labeling information, few products are designed to enable facile identification and verification of a patient's prescribed medications. The innovation proposed in this Phase I SBIR addresses this gap in medication management tools designed for older adult patients. We will use a combination of innovative mechanical and software engineering techniques to build the Scriptmate system, which will be designed to assist older adult patients with easy identification and verification of medications using a pill scanner and facilitate medication consolidation, and access to medication information via patient-facing mobile application. The goal of this Phase I SBIR is to assess the feasibility and usability of Scriptmate. Three substudies will be conducted with older adult patients and pharmacists using a user-centered design framework to address the project goal: a formative assessment (N=20), prototype walkthrough interviews (N=10) and one-on-one usability testing sessions (N=10). PROJECT NARRATIVE Patient misunderstanding of prescription medication label instructions has been found to be one of the main root causes of medication errors that can lead to ADEs. While this is an issue that affects patients of all ages, older adult patients with multiple morbidities and complex medication regimens are at greatest risk. Our proposed system, Scriptmate, uses a combination of mechanical and software engineering to directly address a gap in medication management innovations today, allowing older adults to easily identify and verify medications and consolidate medications on a schedule based on key health literacy principles. Results of this project will have implications for the care of aging adults with increasingly complex medication regimens, and potentially for other sub-populations with reduced physical and cognitive abilities.",Scriptmate: A patient-centered mobile system for geriatric prescription medication management,9410102,R43AG057319,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Labeling', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Image', 'Inpatients', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medication Errors', 'Medication Management', 'Medicine', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Older Population', 'Oral', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Polypharmacy', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'design', 'formative assessment', 'health literacy', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'mobile application', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'pill', 'prototype', 'repository', 'satisfaction', 'statistics', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web app']",NIA,"DIMAGI, INC.",R43,2018,224991,0.039109739385736406
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9421755,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid use', 'overdose death', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,601139,0.019345477272289417
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9382352,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2017,479151,0.02257389800181083
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,9370133,R01NR016732,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Nursing', 'Research', 'Self Management', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain health', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'cost', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'personalized intervention', 'physical conditioning', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology validation', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'usability']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,352983,0.036278442850991514
"Using existing data to understand and ameliorate risk in opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, leading to unprecedented levels of overdose deaths and other harms. Effective treatment for opioid use disorders is available, in the form of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine. However, there are significant questions about the risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization during and after treatment, and unplanned treatment cessation. What is the magnitude of these risks, and what patient, treatment setting, and provider factors may contribute to or protect against risk? Additionally, it is increasingly clear that more sophisticated approaches to patient assessment and treatment planning than are currently used are needed to minimise risk. We aim to: 1. Determine the magnitude of risk for specific adverse clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, hospitalization and ED presentation, and unplanned treatment cessation) during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; 2. Identify patient, treatment setting, and provider risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; and 3. Develop a risk prediction model to identify patients at greatest risk of adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT. To achieve these aims, this project will use existing population-based Australian data on OAT, linked to several health and criminal justice datasets to provide a rich understanding of treatment exposures and outcomes. These data will be used to inform strategies to guide the delivery of high-quality treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States. Specifically, the project will provide data about the magnitude of risk of adverse clinical outcomes during specific treatment and post-treatment periods, and identify patient, treatment setting and provider factors that influence risk. Additionally, it will use innovative machine learning techniques to demonstrate the potential for routinely collected data to be used to assess patient risk at point-of-care, allowing for the development of tailored treatment plans that minimize risk and maximize treatment retention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid agonist therapy is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder, including prescription opioid use disorder. However, important questions about safety and risks during treatment remain unanswered. This study will examine risk and protective factors for death, hospitalization, and unplanned treatment cessation during and after opioid agonist therapy.",Using existing data to understand and ameliorate risk in opioid agonist therapy,9365365,R01DA044170,"['Adverse event', 'Aftercare', 'Agonist', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'New South Wales', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prisons', 'Probability', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withholding Treatment', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'forest', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'point of care', 'population based', 'population health', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'scale up', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES,R01,2017,197214,0.02288349379841006
"Integrated Model of Palliative and Primary Care in Seriously Ill Older Adults Project Summary Background Palliative care is known to improve patient outcomes and reduce health care utiliza- tion in patients with cancer. But we know little on how to deliver palliative care to the large and growing population of older patients with multiple chronic conditions. Palliative care clinicians are a scarce resource, so care must be targeted to the subset of patients who would benefit most: those at highest risk of near-term death. This is a major challenge outside of specific diseases with known trajectories. Clinicians struggle with prognosis, and current statistical models perform poorly. Aims We will use novel predictive modeling methods (`machine learning') to identify complex old- er patients at high risk of one-year mortality, drawing on our team's prior work in data analytics and machine learning. We will apply these methods to a diverse population of older patients with multi- ple chronic conditions, in a large academic primary care network. Building on our team's track rec- ord of successful clinical trials, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of palliative care inte- grated with primary care, targeting older patients at the highest predicted risk of death. We will as- sess impact on a range of measurable patient-reported outcomes and health care utilization. Study design We will develop a model to predict one-year mortality in primary care patients over 65, using a rich set of variables from electronic health records. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning models are highly accurate for predicting mortality out-of-sample, i.e., in patients the model has never seen. We will identify patients at the highest risk of death—who would benefit most from scarce palliative care resources—and approach them to participate in a randomized trial, comparing usual primary care to primary care integrated with palliative care. The intervention, a series of home-based visits by palliative care clinicians, will build a longitudinal relationship with the patient and primary care team. This strategy is designed specifically to meet the needs of older pa- tients, as well as busy primary care clinicians. We will power the study to detect changes in two primary outcomes: quality of life and care intensity, measured by hospital and emergency visits. Other outcomes include symptom burden, advanced care planning, hospice use, and mortality. Implications This project will generate the first evidence on a new model of palliative care for older adults with multiple chronic illnesses, delivered `upstream' in the disease trajectory. We will build the technical and clinical infrastructure needed to target palliative care interventions for older adults outside of specific disease-based programs. A successful trial would facilitate broader adop- tion of similar interventions for older adults, and fundamentally transform the scale and scope of palliative care efforts in this population. Project Narrative Despite major advances in palliative care for patients with specific diseases, we know little about how to deliver palliative interventions `upstream'—earlier in the disease trajectory for older adults with multiple chronic conditions. We will apply advanced predictive modeling techniques (`machine learning') to identify older patients in a primary care setting who would benefit most from palliative care: those whose complex interplay of chronic conditions puts them at high risk of near-term death. Building on our team's strong infrastructure for clinical trials in palliative care, we will enroll the highest-risk patients in a randomized controlled trial, comparing usual primary care to primary care integrated with palliative care.",Integrated Model of Palliative and Primary Care in Seriously Ill Older Adults,9565691,R56AG055728,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Area Under Curve', 'Awareness', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Geriatrics', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SF-12', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cost', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'palliative', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'trial comparing']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R56,2017,382595,0.08438034224262278
"Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults spend over 8 hours per day sitting, more than any other age group. High sedentary time has now been associated with adverse health impacts (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease related mortality) independent from physical activity. This suggests that research explicitly focusing on sedentary behavior is warranted. To further the field of sedentary behavior research among older adults with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, three gaps will be addressed: 1) improving measures of sedentary time using advanced technology-based methods (due to limitations of self-reports and traditional accelerometer data processing techniques); 2) understanding relationships between sedentary time and cardio-metabolic biomarkers and health conditions; and, 3) developing technology-based interventions to reduce sedentary time. The iSTAND (Investigating Sedentary Time in Aging: New Directions using technology) Project aims to address these gaps using data from 3 rich sources (Successful Aging Evaluation [SAGE] Study, the Women's Health Initiative [WHI] Long Life Study, and a participant pool from a large integrated health care system). In the first research aim, objective measurement techniques for sedentary time (e.g. accelerometers, SenseCam, machine learning algorithms) are explored (Aim 1a), and machine learning algorithms for accelerometer data are applied to the WHI sample to examine relationships between sedentary time and health risk factors among older women (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, focus groups will be conducted to inform development of a technology-based sedentary time reduction program targeting older adults with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease. In a pilot intervention, the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be tested in 40 older aduls with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease from a large integrated health care system. The research plans dovetail with training plans for Dr. Rosenberg to obtain necessary skills and knowledge in 2 key areas where she has deficits: 1) wireless technologies to measure sedentary time more accurately, and, 2) application of wireless technologies to sedentary time reduction interventions among older adults. The project will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (bioinformatics, technology and measurement, geriatrics, statistics) and knowledge obtained through training experiences, coursework, and conferences. Support from this 4-year patient-oriented research career development award will position Dr. Rosenberg to lead an independent research program in using technology decrease sedentary time among older adults with chronic health conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sedentary behaviors (activities done in a seated or lying down position, such as watching television) are associated with many adverse health impacts. Older adults with chronic conditions engage in high levels of sedentary time, yet sedentary time is an understudied behavioral risk. This project will leverage technology advancements to measure sedentary time and examine relationships with health risk factors. It will also develop a technology-based program to reduce sedentary time and support healthy aging in the growing population of older adults with chronic health conditions.",Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND),9323499,K23HL119352,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hour', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Older Population', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Preparation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wireless Technology', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'frailty', 'group intervention', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light intensity', 'moderate-to-vigorous physical activity', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'older women', 'patient oriented research', 'population based', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'retention rate', 'satisfaction', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'tool', 'tv watching']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,K23,2017,137691,0.09025032908403709
"Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Individual sleep disorders and characteristics are known to be associated with adverse health outcomes. However, few studies consider sleep in a multivariate context. Therefore, we propose a paradigmatic shift in sleep research towards sleep health. Conducting research through a sleep health lens can change health practice by clarifying which sleep characteristics are most important to treat, enhancing screening efforts, and facilitating the generalization of findings to all individuals, not just those with specific sleep disorders or complaints. Before achieving these long-term goals, however, the crucial first steps in the study of sleep health are to determine which sleep profiles predict health outcomes (Aim 1), and develop predictive algorithms that can identify individuals at risk of adverse health outcomes based on their sleep and other risk factors (Aim 2). These aims can only be achieved with an awareness of the statistical challenges related to the inherent multidimensionality of sleep health (e.g. multiple domains of sleep, multiple characteristics to represent each domain, multiple data sources, etc.). This multidimensionality generates substantial methodological barriers regarding variable and model selection and threatens researchers' abilities to develop transparent and reproducible models. In this R01, investigators will apply rigorous, sophisticated statistical methods to a large aggregated sample of adults aged >60 with self-report and polysomnographic characterization and over 10 years of longitudinal follow-up from three parent studies: Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study (MrOS), Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). In Aim 1, investigators will determine which multidimensional sleep profiles predict time to mortality in older adults using Cox-proportional hazards models, tree-structured survival analysis, and clustering. In Aim 2, investigators will develop powerful machine learning algorithms that incorporate sleep and other risk factors to identify which older adults have the greatest risk for early mortality. Within each aim, the impact of sex and race will be rigorously investigated, and models will be internally validated in independent samples to ensure reproducibility. The Secondary Aim is to investigate generalizability to studies with different demographic profiles and sleep protocols (Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, Honolulu Asia Aging Study of Sleep America) and different data types (sleep diary, actigraphy). All models will be developed in the context of other important known risk factors, including but not limited to age, gender, race, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and BMI. Findings from Aim 1 will jumpstart subsequent mechanistic research focused on sleep-related causal factors of mortality, leading to identification of targeted treatments for sleep problems that could reduce risk of mortality and morbidity. Findings from Aim 2 will provide important preliminary evidence for enhanced screening tools that can more accurately identify which individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project initiates a paradigmatic research shift by studying multivariate sleep health in older adults. Cutting- edge statistical methods will be applied to a large, multi-cohort sample, and replicability of findings will be rigorously investigated. Achieving the proposed aims will improve health practice by: (1) determining which multivariate sleep profiles predict mortality in older adults, thereby jumpstarting subsequent mechanistic research on sleep-related causal factors of mortality and targeted treatments to reduce mortality; and (2) suggesting prediction algorithms that incorporate sleep to enhance health screening for adverse health outcomes in older adults.",Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods,9360318,R01AG056331,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Vision', 'Wakefulness', 'Well in self', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'diaries', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'health practice', 'improved', 'lens', 'men', 'mortality', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prediction algorithm', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,353303,0.10361014305628423
"An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics Project Summary Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper neurological development. During sleep, there is enhanced synaptic plasticity in the nervous system in addition to often extensive neural remodeling. Although we know that sleep regulation is important to neurological development, many aspects of sleep regulation are poorly understood. In particular, the mechanisms of how we compensate for missed sleep in future sleep cycles are mysterious, despite general knowledge of how circadian rhythms are established. It is likely that these mechanisms involve neuropeptide signaling in the brain. However, current tools to study the roles these peptides play in sleep homeostasis, even with the use of simple model organisms like C. elegans, are low- throughput, qualitative, and subjective. In order to study sleep-like behavior in C. elegans, there is an unmet need for a tool for continuously monitoring and perturbing long-term behavior of the worm, as well as an automated and un-biased method for quantifying behavioral data. In this proposal, we will first develop the enabling technology, and use it to identify the roles of neuropeptides in homeostasis of the nematode’s sleep- like state. In Aim I, we will engineer and validate a scalable microscopy platform for monitoring and perturbing C. elegans behavior, decreasing the cost of long-term candidate screens by ~ 100 fold. In Aim 2, we will quantify behavior of wild-type animals via an automated and bias-free quantitative analysis to establish baseline behavior and prioritize behaviors that are linked to sleep homeostasis. In Aim 3, we will use the technology developed in Aims I and 2 to quantify differences in behavior of C. elegans neuropeptide mutants using a candidate approach. Because of the strong preliminary data we have gathered so far and the experience of the sponsor’s laboratory, this proposed work is likely to identify the roles of these candidate neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis, contributing to our mechanistic understanding of sleep regulation. Furthermore, the tools we develop for this particular study will also have broad utilities in many other problems, such as developmental programming, aging, and neurobehavioral studies. Project Narrative Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper brain development and is linked to a variety of neurological and behavioral disorders. In particular, how animals correct for interrupted sleep cycles in future cycles could lead to therapeutic targets, but apart from a few implicated neuropeptides, little is known about the mechanisms behind this aspect of sleep. The objective of this proposal is to identify the roles of neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis by screening C. elegans mutants for behavioral defects.",An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics,9396432,F31GM123662,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Interruption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Middle Insomnia', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropeptides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Reproduction', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Study models', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'age related', 'behavioral study', 'circadian pacemaker', 'cost', 'developmental genetics', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurobehavioral', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sleep regulation', 'software development', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2017,44044,0.05615303425403343
"Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans spend over 90% of their activity related energy expenditure performing common daily activities. Health care professionals use normative data as a guide to prescribe appropriate activities for patients and clients. Additionally, scientists use this resource to plan physical activity or nutritional interventions ad apply these estimates to epidemiological research. However, while normative data have existed for over 20 years and are seemingly accurate in young adults, they can lead to misguided estimates of the metabolic cost of daily activities in older adults. This is not a trivial issue sice physical activity is one of the only known modalities to improve physical function in older adults and plays a critical role in regulating body weight. However, there is a serious lack of information pertaining to potential age-related differences in the metabolic cost of daily activitis. This leaves a major gap in knowledge for properly prescribing physical activity for a population that has elevated risk cardiopulmonary and orthopedic impairments. The primary goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that aging is associated with a difference in the metabolic cost f doing exercise and lifestyle activities. We will assess pulmonary gas exchange in 210 adults aged 20 to 80+ years with a portable indirect calorimeter worn while performing 38 daily activities. We will examine the metabolic equivalent (MET as a function of 3.5 milliliter"" min-1""kg-1), metabolic economy (energy expended for a given work rate) and relative metabolic cost (as a function of resting and peak oxygen consumption) for each task as a function of age. Secondly, we will address how metabolic costs of daily activities are affected by having functional impairments by testing an additional 90 older adults (60+ years) with functional impairment. Thirdly, because scientists and public health officials alike rely on perception-based exertion to monitor intensity of physical activity, we will address the question- ""Is aging associated with inaccuracies for self-gauging perceived exertion?"" Addressing this question will gain insight into a better delivery system for recommending physical intensity to older adults. Lastly, the design and comprehensive metabolic measurements being proposed will provide an unprecedented opportunity to validate accelerometers for estimating the type and intensity of physical activity. Using new mathematical techniques that apply machine learning approaches (random forests, support vector and multiple kernel learning techniques), we will assess the potential to reduce the error in estimating the type and intensity of physical activity as compared to traditional methods. There are many end products of this research. First, the work will produce the largest dataset of metabolic cost for daily activities in 60+ years old. Second, an age-correction factor for metabolic costs will be created to apply to hundreds of tasks that fall into similar categories as those being evaluated. Finally, the work will refine the tools needed to feasibly assess physical activity in young and old adults. These accomplishments will directly impact the fields of epidemiology, geriatric medicine, rehabilitation, and nutritional sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will advance the understanding the differences in the metabolic costs of daily activities due to old age and functional impairment. This is highly relevant to NIH's mission of promoting health by reducing the burdens of physical disability in old age.",Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults,9291394,R01AG042525,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Americas', 'Ankle', 'Beds', 'Body Weight', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nutritional Science', 'Orthopedics', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Gas Exchange', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'falls', 'fitness', 'forest', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical methods', 'metabolic rate', 'middle age', 'milliliter', 'named group', 'portability', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation science', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2017,293788,0.018678386707385905
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9266749,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phonation', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,600547,0.012641549366951565
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9278036,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2017,1755747,0.01619579242279408
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9353310,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2017,157988,0.07221116368957328

"A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults Abstract  People aged 65+ will represent 21% of the U.S. population and increase to about 80 million by 2040, and the oldest old (age 85+) will number ~ 14.1 million. Population aging presents both opportunities and challenges for our healthcare, the economy, and existing social support systems. Many older adults especially the oldest old, minorities and those of lower Socio-Economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, poor diet, and decreased levels of physical activity each of which influence morbidity and mortality. Mobile-based, tablet-based, and in-home technologies provide an excellent opportunity for projecting behavior- change interventions and social support into the everyday life of older adults at great economies of scale. The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system, designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2) the Fittle+ mobile platform designed to support positive health behavior change through integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence (AI). The study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1 we will develop and pilot test the FSS with representative samples of older adults. Phase 2 will involve a two group randomized trial where participants will be randomized to the Fittle Senior System (FSS, an adaptive coaching and social support system using mobile technology) or to a paper-based psycho-educational (BPE) control condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at risk for social isolation (90 per condition - 30 White Caucasians, 30 Black/African Americans and 30 Hispanic Americans). We will recruit males and females commensurate to the gender proportions represented in this age group and work to ensure that we have sufficient representation from the “oldest old” cohort. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on clinically significant measures of health and health behaviors and indices of social support. We will also gather information on potential moderating (e.g., ethnicity, age) and mediating variables (e.g., health self-efficacy), which will be examined using multilevel modeling techniques guided by current theories of behavior change and technology acceptance and use among older adults. Project Narrative This proposed project is addressing a critical public concern. The population is aging and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are common among older adults especially ethnic minorities. This study will develop and evaluate a mobile technology-based intervention designed to support positive health behavior change among diverse older adults through integrated online social support, personalized coaching and goal setting.",A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults,9346004,R01AG053163,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caucasians', 'Chronic', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Industry', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Jordan', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Support System', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'active method', 'age group', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinically significant', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'dynamic system', 'education research', 'efficacy trial', 'ethnic minority population', 'family structure', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'low socioeconomic status', 'male', 'medical schools', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'nutrition', 'programs', 'psychoeducational', 'psychoeducational intervention', 'randomized trial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,579139,0.04272646449670042
"NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed project aims at developing a novel quadrupedal human-assistive robotic platform (Q-HARP}, with the objective of helping the large number of elderly individuals live a healthy, physically active life style. The Q-HARP primarily functions as a smart power-assist walker: a user, situated in the center of the legged robot, can enjoy the desired amount of power assist in walking according to his/her intent. As such, a Q-HARP user is able to perform an appropriate amount of physical activity, while enjoying the enhanced level of mobility during his/her daily lif. Furthermore, with the Q-HARP's legged motion, the human-robot system can easily overcome most obstacles in the daily life. With this capability, the Q-HARP has a potential of becoming a basic building block for Aging-in-Place, enabling elderly individuals to stay in their home longer without conducting costly modification to their existing home structures. To develop this innovative robot, the investigators will conduct research in various aspects of the project. The specific aims of the project are: AIM 1) Understand user needs and promote user involvement in the research process; AIM 2) Create a systematic design framework for the human-assistive quadrupedal robot, and build robot prototypes for experimental testing; AIM 3) Develop a 3D computer vision-based approach for motion and environment detection; AIM 4) Study the human assistive strategies in assistive walking and emergency response; AIM 5) Develop an intelligent robot control system for interactive assistance in locomotion; AIM 6) Conduct experiments to test the robot performance in human assistance tasks. The project's potential bene*fits to society are substantial. By 2030, there will be 71 million older adults living in the S, accounting for 20°/o of the entire population. For the health and well ness of older adults, a key contributing factor is to be physically active. However, a large number of older adults have significant difficulty in staying physically active due to mobility impairment. By providing desire physical assistance in the coordinated locomotion, the Q-HARP is anticipated to restore an elderly person's mobility, keep him/her physically active, and enjoy a more healthy life with reduced reliance on the assistance of caregivers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The human-assistive robotic platform in this proposal has a potential of promoting and improving the health and well ness of the large elderly population in the US, and thus is in direct support of NINR's mission. Specifically, it fits well into the theme of ""Wellness: Promoting Health and Preventing Illness"" by helping elderly individuals to stay physically active and prevent the illnesses associated with the sedentary lifestyle.",NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP),9313141,R01NR016151,"['Accounting', 'Aging', 'Caregivers', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Emergency response', 'Environment', 'Equine mule', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Locomotion', 'Mental Depression', 'Mission', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Walkers', 'Walking', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot control', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2017,125000,0.057183459762206956
"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar. The outcome of this work will result in automated health assessments that make use of smart technology, recommendations for improving the ecological validity of office-based clinical assessments, automated real-time intervention methods that can help support preventative health care measures, and clinically-relevant, user-friendly interfaces for integration of smart home data into health records. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smar home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to gather validated activity and health related information that can be used by the medical community to improve the efficacy of traditional assessment and support ecological momentary intervention techniques. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance,9303391,R01EB009675,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Phonation', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Software Design', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'computer science', 'coping', 'cost effective', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology development', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,334829,0.059964002513255704
"A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of adults age � 65 years have high blood pressure (BP), but optimal management of high BP in the elderly remains controversial. Contrary to evidence in middle age that lowering BP is clearly beneficial, data in older adults are inconsistent and high BP may not be a risk factor in all elders. We recently reported that, among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey age e65 years, high BP was a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death only among persons in better health status (defined as fast walking of a 20-ft walk test). In contrast, high BP was not a risk factor among slow walkers. Additionally, the benefit of lowering BP in all elders remains an issue of debate; a recent meta-analysis in persons age 80 years and older reported no benefit of BP treatment on mortality, and significant heterogeneity across trials. Finally, there is growin concern for potential harms associated with treatment to lower BP. Excessive lowering of BP, particularly diastolic, has been associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in some studies. In the proposed research, we propose a novel paradigm where the associations of BP with adverse outcomes in older persons are considered in the setting of the complex aging process. Our long-term goal is to reliably identify elderly persons in whom BP treatment is beneficial and those in whom treatment is ineffective or even harmful, by defining subpopulations of similar health status. Specifically, aim 1 proposes to elucidate factors from four domains (functional, cognitive/mental, self-rated health, and physiologic) that can identify elderly persons in whom high systolic BP is strongly associated with higher risk for death and CV events, and those in whom it is not, using data from three NIH-funded cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) and Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA). In aim 2, we will evaluate the role of diastolic BP across level of health status. Finally, based on findings from these observational cohorts, in aim 3 we will evaluate whether these factors can identify elderly persons in whom treatment to lower BP is of maximum benefit in two randomized controlled trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SHEP) and the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3). Since participants in trials are healthier than the U.S. population, we will also evaluate the effect of treatment in the observational studies, using state-of-the-art causal inference methods, which can correct for the bias of standard analytic approaches. Completion of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the importance of high BP in older adults; will improve our ability to identify elderly persons who will benefit from BP treatment; will allow a systematic understanding of groups in whom evidence for BP treatment is lacking; and will guide design of future trials of hypertension in elderly adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Treatment of high blood pressure in elderly persons remains controversial.

"Working Memory Training in Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that cognitive interventions targeting working memory are beneficial in that they show generalizing effects that go beyond what has been specifically trained, i.e. transfer effects. Although it seems more difficult to observe such transfer effects in older adults as compared to young adults or children, we and others have found that some interventions do show promise in older populations. Despite the promising results, more research is needed to make our interventions more effective and more robust, and to uncover the underlying mechanisms of training in an aging population. For our proposed studies, we envision two lines of research with different goals: First, we aim to address questions of pragmatics. Our goal here is to make our intervention more accessible and inviting for participants, thus increasing their motivation to participate effectively in training regimens. In addition, we will investigate the intervention's optimal scheduling (i.e., spacing of practice), and explore whether the improvements extend to measures of everyday functioning, and finally, investigate longitudinal effects and their trajectories over the course of one year after training completion. These are our applied goals. Second, we propose to address the most important questions of any intervention research: The investigation of the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of improvement. Furthermore, we will shed light on individual differences as moderating factors for training success. These are our mechanistic goals. Given the sparse availability of effective cognitive interventions, and the limited knowledge about their generalizing effects to applied measures of daily living, the proposed work will have important implications in that it will shed more light on the mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in old age, and serve as groundwork for future large-scale randomized clinical trials and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The vast majority of our nation's aging population will experience some decline in cognitive function with age. Therefore, the development of effective preventative interventions to mitigate age-related cognitive decline is of critical importance in that those interventions could not only impact older adults' cognitive and daily life functioning, but ultimately, contribute to their well-being and quality of life. The proposed work will have important implications in that it will get at the underlying mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in ld age, and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted cognitive interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia.",Working Memory Training in Older Adults,9284375,R01AG049006,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Financial compensation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Motivation', 'Older Population', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Self Efficacy', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specificity', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'active control', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'improved', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2017,648284,0.008113992544201342
"Pre-clinic model for sleep deprivation-induced obesity and hedonic intake due to noise exposure Easy access to calories and poor sleep independently increase eating and weight gain. Sleep deprivation (SD) increases hedonic intake (eating palatable food for pleasure) and in humans environmental noise exposure causes SD, is detrimental to health and increases obesity risk. We have shown that noise (pre-recorded random city sounds) causes SD, hyperphagia and weight gain in male rats, which is novel and replicates human data. Yet this methodology must be established in female rodents as sex is a critical biological variable. The overall goal is to establish the method of SD by noise to induce obesity in female rodents, use the model to define the contribution of hedonic intake to SD-induced obesity and use these data to develop a non- invasive method to distinguish types of sleep (REM vs. non-REM). Aim 1 will use statistical learning methods and data mining to quantify REM and non-REM based on data collected from studies in this proposal (food intake, physical activity energy expenditure, EEG, EMG) and will establish SD by noise in females as a pre- clinical model for obesity due to SD. We will compare sleep disruption caused by noise exposure and the gentle handling technique; test whether sex moderates the effect of noise exposure on sleep, weight gain and food intake and whether Suvorexant (used clinically for insomnia) normalizes sleep in noise-exposed rats. Finally, data mining will be completed to address a critical need in the sleep field: to develop a high-throughput, non-invasive technique to distinguish REM vs. non-REM in rats. In humans, SD increases hedonic intake, which promotes obesity. Taste preference is highly variable and may modulate hedonic intake caused by SD. We show clear individual taste preferences for snacks using a cafeteria (CAF) diet protocol (i.e. rotating selection of palatable human snacks plus rodent chow ad lib). We also show SD by noise increases chocolate intake in sated rats with low initial preference for chocolate and maintains intake in rats with high preference. Thus, SD by noise may increase intake of palatable foods that would normally be avoided during adequate sleep. Aim 2 will test if the effects of SD by noise on hedonic intake and obesity are dependent upon sex and individual taste preferences in rats. We will test whether SD increases binge chocolate intake and intake of CAF diet snacks. The scientific premise is: SD in increases hedonic intake and promotes obesity in humans; environmental noise promotes SD in humans; and our pre-clinical model mirrors the human response to SD. We hypothesize that like male rats, SD due to noise will cause obesity in females and increase hedonic intake despite individual preference to in turn worsen obesity. The innovation lies in establishing a simple method of SD that replicates human SD-induced obesity; developing a non-surgical method to measure sleep types; and identifying how individual preferences affects hedonic intake and obesity caused by SD. Its significance lies in establishing a translational model of SD independent of sex to identify mechanisms underlying reward behavior and obesity propensity due to SD, with the ultimate goal of developing novel anti-obesity therapies. The goal of these studies is to establish our method of sleep deprivation by environmental noise to induce obesity, and use this model to define the contribution of hedonic intake to obesity due to sleep deprivation in humans. Studies will employ a novel method of partial sleep deprivation by noise, which mimics weight gain in sleep deprived humans. We propose to establish sleep deprivation by noise in females rats, as we have shown in males, as a pre-clinical model for obesity due to sleep deprivation, develop a non-invasive method to distinguish REM from non-REM sleep based on food intake, physical activity, energy expenditure, EEG and EMG data, in lieu of EEG/EMG recordings, and define the effects of sleep deprivation by noise on hedonic intake and its influence on obesity in males and female rats. Completing these studies will provide a valid translational pre-clinical model of sleep deprivation to identify how sleep deprivation alters reward behavior, eating and obesity propensity, with the ultimate goal of developing new therapies against obesity.",Pre-clinic model for sleep deprivation-induced obesity and hedonic intake due to noise exposure,9386535,R21NS099468,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Welfare', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body Weight', 'Calories', 'Chocolate', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Electroencephalography', 'Energy Intake', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperphagia', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Middle Insomnia', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'REM Sleep', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleeplessness', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Study models', 'Taste preferences', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'data mining', 'defined contribution', 'experience', 'feeding', 'food consumption', 'hedonic', 'human data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'noise pollution', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'obesity risk', 'pleasure', 'preference', 'response', 'sex', 'sound', 'urban area']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2017,227208,0.031000439547574837
"Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality Abstract Older adults struggle to engage in health enhancing physical activity (PA) and spend up to 11 hours a day sitting. Older women, in particular, are at increased risk of chronic disease and disability, and use a high proportion of healthcare resources. Improving both these behaviors has promise for improving several salient aging outcomes, but evidence to inform guidelines on how best to interrupt long periods of sedentary behavior (SB) are lacking. Few laboratory-based trials have included adults over 70 years old, have focused on PA to interrupt SB, and have not tested standing breaks that might be acceptable to older adults. A recent review showed that in the real world, traditional PA interventions do not meaningfully impact SB. In contrast, interventions that focus on standing can reduce SB, up to 2 hours per day. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between self-reported SB and increased risks of death and metabolic outcomes, but very few prospective studies have employed objective measures of SB. Although accelerometer measures can indicate the intensity of movement or lack of it, traditional cutpoints do not accurately classify behaviors such as sitting, standing or walking. While pilot intervention studies, using thigh worn inclinometers, have demonstrated that SB can be greatly reduced, there are no RCTs in older adults with health outcomes. There is much room for improvement in our understanding of SB and healthy aging. The National Institute on Aging conducted a summer workshop series to address this issue in 2013. We have therefore designed a Program project – Sedentary Time and Aging Research (STAR) – to provide more rigorous and comprehensive evidence on how to interrupt sitting time and the consequences for healthy aging. In particular, we are proposing a paradigm shift away from energy expenditure as the primary mechanism for health outcomes to investigating behaviors such as brief sit-to-stand transitions that expend little energy but engage muscles, improve postural blood flow, and may impact physical functioning in older adults. Further, we will study a broader range of outcomes than investigated to date, including targeted novel mechanisms important for healthy aging. The STAR program will include 3 Projects and 2 Cores for study of postmenopausal women at risk for chronic disease. STAR includes 2 randomized trials, in the laboratory (N=86) and in the real world (N=592), with focus on optimizing new computational techniques to apply to existing prospective accelerometer data (n>6000). All projects will investigate the consequences of extended sitting, standing, brief sit-to-stand transitions and PA breaks on mechanisms of healthy aging including glucose regulation, endothelial functioning, and mitochondrial functioning. We will also investigate physical functioning, blood pressure and in Project 3, 5-7 year mortality risk. All Projects will compare effects across age groups. STAR will provide a comprehensive evidence base that can inform public health guidelines on SB and aging. We will coordinate our efforts with a new American Heart Association Center on SB and Latinas.  Narrative Sitting time may be particularly bad for the health of older women.

"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,9205503,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'cohesion', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'speech recognition', 'support network', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2017,2137301,0.04738251163711153
"Chronic Conditions and Mutuality of Care in Late Life Marriage:A Multi-method App DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% experience functional disability. Thus, married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditios and disability of their own but also their spouse's. Understanding how support dynamics in marriage influence each partner's health will provide great insight into helping couples stay healthier and functionally independent into late life. The aim of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA) is to train the candidate in epidemiology of aging and advanced dyadic data analysis techniques to build on her expertise in experimental research and to understand how mutual care in late-life marriage influence health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression, and longevity. The proposed research focuses on older couples in which both partners suffer from chronic conditions and disability, and drawing from communal relationships theory, mutual care is defined as both partners receiving high levels of balanced instrumental and emotional support from one another. Through this MRSDA, the candidate will (1) learn from expert mentors and consultants about the epidemiology of aging and advanced statistical techniques to analyze dyadic, longitudinal data, (2) conduct secondary analysis on a large epidemiologic dyadic data set to examine how mutual care in older adult marriages influences long-term health and longevity and an experiment to examine a proposed mechanism, cardiovascular stress recovery, (3) complete coursework in epidemiology of aging, advanced epidemiologic statistics, and research ethics, and (4) attend workshops on dyadic data analysis. Yale University is a phenomenal environment to pursue this training as it has extensive resources in epidemiology of aging, statistics for analyzing epidemiologic data, experimental relationships research, and cardiovascular psychophysiology. The candidate has a state-of-the- art observational and psychophysiology lab that she will utilize for this project. Th Yale School of Public Health and the Claude D. Pepper Older American's Independence Center at Yale have excellent junior faculty mentoring programs. The candidate's primary mentor, Dr. Becca Levy at Yale School of Public Health has extensive expertise in bridging experimental and epidemiological methods to study psychosocial factors and health in older adults, including dyads. Dr. Richard Schulz will serve as a co-mentor, as he is the primary investigator for the Cardiovascular Health Effects Study which will be used for Study 1 of the proposed research and is an expert in conducting large, longitudinal studies. Dr. Trace Kershaw, an expert in dyadic data analysis at Yale School of Public Health, will also be a co-mentor. The proposed training will occur in the context of (1) a longitudinal study of married couples in which both members of the couple have chronic conditions and disability (Study 1; The Caregiver Health Effects Study; n=819 couples; an ancillary study to the Cardiovascular Health Study) examining the influence of mutual support on health trajectories (e.g. clinical and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease, clinical depression, and self-reported health) and longevity, and (2) an experimental study (Study 2; n=100 couples) examining cardiovascular stress recovery, a proposed mechanism for the link between mutual care and cardiovascular health proposed in Study 1. In the experimental study each partner will discuss a health-related stressor, and mutual support will be manipulated and compared to a control and one-sided support conditions to examine the effects on cardiovascular stress recovery. Consistent with the priorities outlined by the National Institute on Aging, the proposed MRSDA has the potential to address mechanisms for links between interpersonal relationships and health in the context of aging (RFA: PA-11-128). Further, the combination of training and research will serve as a spring board for the candidate's independent research career to elucidate how interpersonal relationships influence health among older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% are functionally disabled. Married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditions and disability of their own but also their spouse's.

"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI. The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years. One of our overarching goals is to achieve a highly useful 7T clinical utility, which requires high quality, robust, and consistent acquisitions. This could be a potentially exclusive (over other human MRI field strengths) application for 7T imaging.",High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression,9352370,R01MH111265,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Consultations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Edema', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Gliosis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heating', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'Work', 'absorption', 'aging brain', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disturbance in affect', 'follow-up', 'geriatric depression', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'radiofrequency', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'vascular depression']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,600239,0.08713987921176702
"Opioid Use and Safety in US Nursing Homes PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Nationwide use of prescription opioids quadrupled to more than 240 million prescriptions per year between 1999 to 2010. This increase has been accompanied by an alarming rise in opioid misuse and abuse, addiction, and fatal and nonfatal overdoses. In response to this growing national epidemic, the Department of Health and Human Services has called for the creation of clear opioid prescribing guidelines and further developing the evidence base to guide opioid prescribing for the management of pain. To date, guidelines have largely focused on opioid use in younger adults despite the unique issues facing older adults (≥65 years old) including a large burden of pain, extensive analgesics use, and recent increase in drug overdose-related deaths in the elderly population. Prior guidelines have provided no direction regarding appropriate opioid use to treat pain in nursing home residents. This is problematic due to the high prevalence of chronic pain in nursing home residents as well as age-related vulnerability to adverse drug events due to changes in pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and higher prevalence of multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy in this population as compared to noninstitutionalized older adults.  Using an in-house national repository of Minimum Data Set 3.0 – a federally required clinical assessment of all residents in Medicare or Medicaid certified nursing homes – merged to Medicare Part A and D and facility-level characteristics in CASPER (Certification and Survey Provider and Enhanced Reporting) from 2011-2013, this proposal addresses the evidence gap in safe opioid use in US nursing home residents with three specific aims: 1) to identify sociodemographic, clinical, and facility-level correlates of opioid use in terms of duration of use (acute vs. chronic), duration of action (short- vs. long-acting), and dose in “morphine equivalents”; 2) to estimate the incidence of opioid-related drug overdoses and identify resident- and drug regimen-related risk factors for opioid overdose; and 3) to evaluate the comparative safety of specific commonly-initiated opioids in terms of serious adverse health outcomes (all-cause mortality, hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, fractures, and bowel obstruction). Methodological innovations include the use of multilevel modeling and targeted maximum likelihood estimation approaches. This proposal is directly relevant to the approximately 1.4 million older adults living in US nursing homes on any given day – many of whom will receive opioids while institutionalized. The knowledge generated will inform stakeholders on how opioids are used in this population, the risk of overdose when using opioids, and the comparative safety of short- and long- term use of commonly initiated opioids in the nursing home setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 1.4 million US adults live in nursing homes on any given day; many experience acute and chronic pain often treated with opioid analgesics despite the potential risks associated with these medications. This study will describe the resident and facility risk factors associated with receiving opioids, risk factors for opioid overdose, and the comparative safety of commonly-initiated opioids. The results will inform stakeholders on the use and safety of opioids in nursing homes.",Opioid Use and Safety in US Nursing Homes,9328950,F31AG056078,"['Acetaminophen', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Acute Pain', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Analgesics', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Anxiety', 'Big Data', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Certification', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fracture', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitalization', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medication Management', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Non-Malignant', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Research', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacology', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'addiction', 'adverse outcome', 'age related', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'chronic pain', 'comparative', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multilevel analysis', 'neglect', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'prescription opioid', 'repository', 'response', 'safety study', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2017,23642,-0.025652253391891002
"Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health PROJECT SUMMARY Nearly 10% of Americans practice meditation to improve health. Randomized controlled trials support this practice and show that mindfulness training is effective in improving a broad range of health outcomes. In particular, mindfulness training has been shown to reduce biomarkers of systemic inflammation that contribute to the pathophysiology of disease and predict risk for all-cause mortality. Still, little is known about the biological processes linking mindfulness training with inflammation. This proposal tests the hypothesis that mindfulness training aids the regulation of inflammation by mitigating glucocorticoid resistance (GCR). GCR is a leading candidate mechanism linking psychosocial threat with systemic inflammation. Whereas cortisol released in response to threat normally binds to glucocorticoid receptors and down-regulates inflammation, chronic perceptions of threat lead to a state of GCR, in which glucocorticoid receptors become insensitive to the anti-inflammatory effects of circulating cortisol. Mindfulness training is proposed to diminish perceptions of threat in ways that restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. To test this biological pathway, this study assesses functional GCR and biomarkers of inflammation before and after a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or control Health Enhancement Program (HEP) in a sample of lonely older adults (N=188). Loneliness is a form of chronic psychosocial threat, and is consistently associated with GCR and systemic inflammation, yet MBSR is one of very few interventions successful in reducing loneliness. MBSR is expected to decrease GCR (and restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity) compared to HEP from pre- to post- intervention. Moreover, these decreases in GCR are expected to mediate the effects of MBSR (vs. HEP) on lowering systemic inflammation (CRP and IL-6) from pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up. In sum, this proposal investigates decreased GCR as a biological mechanism through which mindfulness training reduces inflammatory disease risk. It addresses NCCIH's call for research on understanding the biological mechanisms of action underlying mind-body intervention approaches and complements NCCIH's special interest in alleviating inflammatory processes. The knowledge gained from this research will contribute to a better understanding of the basic biological pathways underlying mindfulness practices, which may help to identify and target populations likely to benefit from mindfulness training. The research and training plan described in this application provide opportunities for the applicant to develop a knowledge base and methodology in psychoneuroimmunology, learn statistical techniques for analyzing complex mechanistic pathways, and develop the professional skills necessary for a successful career testing biological and psychological mechanisms underlying mind-body interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mindfulness meditation practices are widely used to alleviate physical symptoms, and growing evidence suggests that mindfulness training may reduce systemic inflammation, but less is known about the biological pathways linking mindfulness training with inflammatory processes. The proposed project investigates a biological mechanism, glucocorticoid sensitivity, to explain how mindfulness training lowers inflammation among lonely older adults who are at risk for multiple inflammatory diseases. From a public health perspective, clarifying this mechanistic pathway will help to identify who is likely to show health benefits from mindfulness training.",Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health,9327105,F32AT009508,"['Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood Circulation', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Dexamethasone', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Feeling', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Immune', 'Immunology procedure', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meditation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Mind-Body Intervention', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychoneuroimmunology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'career', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy trial', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health training', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mindfulness meditation', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'physical symptom', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'receptor function', 'receptor sensitivity', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'successful intervention', 'training aid', 'training opportunity']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2017,60834,0.011574238125944818
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Integrated Web-Based Customer Engagement, Physical Exercise, and Coaching Platform for Older Adults ABSTRACT The fast-growing older population coupled with the worsening shortage of caregivers and nurses will soon present our nation with severe societal and economic challenges. Older adults often struggle to maintain quality of life and independence in the presence of chronic diseases and isolation. Physical exercise and socialization have been shown to reduce chronic disease, depression, falls and to improve quality of life in older adults. Motivation and feedback are essential to continued engagement in a wellness program, but doing so through the traditional manner of in-person coaching can be prohibitively expensive. Vigorous Mind (VM) has been providing a web-based platform to promote sustained engagement in older adults primarily in senior living facilities. The platform provides dynamic and tailored content including reminiscence activities, favorite music and video, adaptive computer games and communication. With the help of the Consortium on Technology for Proactive Care, we will enhance the current VM system with an additional interactive physical exercise module and a health coach with automated tailored messaging and incentives for continued engagement and adherence. This will optimize the VM system for home-based deployment, thus expanding the reach and impact of VM to potentially delay or even prevent institutionalization among older adults living independently. There is a compelling need for a tool that can increase older adults’ engagement in physical activity and socialization to reduce chronic disease, depression and falls and improve quality of life in this fast-growing population. The proposed integrated web-based platform represents the first step in the development of environments that combine human and machine intelligence in order to care for older adults and to enhance their quality of life.","Integrated Web-Based Customer Engagement, Physical Exercise, and Coaching Platform for Older Adults",9408822,R43AG057337,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Independent Living', 'Institutionalization', 'Intervention', 'Mental Depression', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Music', 'Nurses', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Exercise', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Retirement', 'Rewards', 'Socialization', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Wellness Program', 'Work', 'base', 'computer game', 'design', 'falls', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'tailored messaging', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,"VIGOROUS MIND, INC.",R43,2017,218333,0.10008708055572453
"Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM) Abstract for Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM) Hypertension is prevalent among older adults. Hypertension increases risk for stroke and myocardial infarction, and can result in end organ damage to the kidneys, retina and brain. Medication adherence is critically important to prevent the deleterious effects of hypertension; yet, adherence is often calculated at only 50%. We developed and tested the Multifaceted Prospective Memory Intervention (MPMI), a behavioral intervention, using theories of prospective memory and aging to improve adherence to antihypertensive medications. The MPMI was tested among older adults (≥ 65 years of age) and improved adherence by 35%. The MPMI was efficacious over the short term, but after an additional 5 months without the ongoing presence of the interventionists, adherence declined. The purpose of the current study is to create an evidence-based smartphone application and companion website in order to provide continuous use of the efficacious strategies to sustain adherence. We are at an exciting time since among persons with hypertension the potential benefits of improved health can be achieved through improved adherence. The recent SPRINT study (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) supports improved outcomes (lower fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause) by targeting a lower systolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg compared to using the previously recommended guideline of 140 mm Hg.2 These outcomes will not be achieved unless we can help people take their medications as prescribed and as intended. Specifically using iterative usability, cognitive walk-through and heuristic evaluation, we will build, test and modify a mobile application (App) and companion website, the Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM). Mobile devices are ubiquitous and can be leveraged to capture the prospective memory strategies and improve adherence. The development of the MEDSReM will be based on the strategies from the MPMI, human factors in aging, preferences, needs and requirements of older adults taking medications using technology and iterative testing to assure usability for older adults. The strategies will be translated to technology and add decision support. Decision support will provide the patient with assistance in taking medications if they have missed a dose. A decision tree will be created with knowledge of pharmacotherapeutic and pharmacokinetics based on the patient's medication time to peak, duration and half-life properties to determine a safe interval for taking missed doses. The final MEDSReM will include a website that can easily be accessed with links in the App for educational support and ongoing coaching. Taking a human factors approach to inform the preferences, needs and requirements for technological support to take medications as intended, and iterative testing for usability of the App and website among older adults, will result in a superior product for the mobile App and website and improve health outcomes. This final product will be field tested and consequent improvement in adherence assessed. Public Health Significance High blood pressure is common among older adults and can lead to poor health including the increased likelihood of stroke and heart disease. Adhering to medications that lower blood pressure is difficult, particularly among older adults who have been shown to experience age-associated declines in cognitive processes that could support medication taking. A previously tested intervention was successful in improving adherence. The aim of this study is to translate the intervention into mobile technology with the goal of sustaining good adherence.","Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM)",9314865,R21NR016285,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Companions', 'Consult', 'Cues', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Financial cost', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Half-Life', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Memory Loss', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Self Management', 'Self-Administered', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'field study', 'handheld mobile device', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'memory process', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'post intervention', 'preference', 'prevent', 'prospective memory', 'prototype', 'software development', 'successful intervention', 'theories', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2017,268625,0.06374593471750399
"Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults spend over 8 hours per day sitting, more than any other age group. High sedentary time has now been associated with adverse health impacts (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease related mortality) independent from physical activity. This suggests that research explicitly focusing on sedentary behavior is warranted. To further the field of sedentary behavior research among older adults with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, three gaps will be addressed: 1) improving measures of sedentary time using advanced technology-based methods (due to limitations of self-reports and traditional accelerometer data processing techniques); 2) understanding relationships between sedentary time and cardio-metabolic biomarkers and health conditions; and, 3) developing technology-based interventions to reduce sedentary time. The iSTAND (Investigating Sedentary Time in Aging: New Directions using technology) Project aims to address these gaps using data from 3 rich sources (Successful Aging Evaluation [SAGE] Study, the Women's Health Initiative [WHI] Long Life Study, and a participant pool from a large integrated health care system). In the first research aim, objective measurement techniques for sedentary time (e.g. accelerometers, SenseCam, machine learning algorithms) are explored (Aim 1a), and machine learning algorithms for accelerometer data are applied to the WHI sample to examine relationships between sedentary time and health risk factors among older women (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, focus groups will be conducted to inform development of a technology-based sedentary time reduction program targeting older adults with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease. In a pilot intervention, the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be tested in 40 older aduls with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease from a large integrated health care system. The research plans dovetail with training plans for Dr. Rosenberg to obtain necessary skills and knowledge in 2 key areas where she has deficits: 1) wireless technologies to measure sedentary time more accurately, and, 2) application of wireless technologies to sedentary time reduction interventions among older adults. The project will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (bioinformatics, technology and measurement, geriatrics, statistics) and knowledge obtained through training experiences, coursework, and conferences. Support from this 4-year patient-oriented research career development award will position Dr. Rosenberg to lead an independent research program in using technology decrease sedentary time among older adults with chronic health conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sedentary behaviors (activities done in a seated or lying down position, such as watching television) are associated with many adverse health impacts. Older adults with chronic conditions engage in high levels of sedentary time, yet sedentary time is an understudied behavioral risk. This project will leverage technology advancements to measure sedentary time and examine relationships with health risk factors. It will also develop a technology-based program to reduce sedentary time and support healthy aging in the growing population of older adults with chronic health conditions.",Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND),9115229,K23HL119352,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hour', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wireless Technology', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'frailty', 'group intervention', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light intensity', 'moderate-to-vigorous physical activity', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'older women', 'patient oriented research', 'population based', 'programs', 'retention rate', 'satisfaction', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'tool', 'tv watching']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,K23,2016,142671,0.09025032908403709
"Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans spend over 90% of their activity related energy expenditure performing common daily activities. Health care professionals use normative data as a guide to prescribe appropriate activities for patients and clients. Additionally, scientists use this resource to plan physical activity or nutritional interventions ad apply these estimates to epidemiological research. However, while normative data have existed for over 20 years and are seemingly accurate in young adults, they can lead to misguided estimates of the metabolic cost of daily activities in older adults. This is not a trivial issue sice physical activity is one of the only known modalities to improve physical function in older adults and plays a critical role in regulating body weight. However, there is a serious lack of information pertaining to potential age-related differences in the metabolic cost of daily activitis. This leaves a major gap in knowledge for properly prescribing physical activity for a population that has elevated risk cardiopulmonary and orthopedic impairments. The primary goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that aging is associated with a difference in the metabolic cost f doing exercise and lifestyle activities. We will assess pulmonary gas exchange in 210 adults aged 20 to 80+ years with a portable indirect calorimeter worn while performing 38 daily activities. We will examine the metabolic equivalent (MET as a function of 3.5 milliliter"" min-1""kg-1), metabolic economy (energy expended for a given work rate) and relative metabolic cost (as a function of resting and peak oxygen consumption) for each task as a function of age. Secondly, we will address how metabolic costs of daily activities are affected by having functional impairments by testing an additional 90 older adults (60+ years) with functional impairment. Thirdly, because scientists and public health officials alike rely on perception-based exertion to monitor intensity of physical activity, we will address the question- ""Is aging associated with inaccuracies for self-gauging perceived exertion?"" Addressing this question will gain insight into a better delivery system for recommending physical intensity to older adults. Lastly, the design and comprehensive metabolic measurements being proposed will provide an unprecedented opportunity to validate accelerometers for estimating the type and intensity of physical activity. Using new mathematical techniques that apply machine learning approaches (random forests, support vector and multiple kernel learning techniques), we will assess the potential to reduce the error in estimating the type and intensity of physical activity as compared to traditional methods. There are many end products of this research. First, the work will produce the largest dataset of metabolic cost for daily activities in 60+ years old. Second, an age-correction factor for metabolic costs will be created to apply to hundreds of tasks that fall into similar categories as those being evaluated. Finally, the work will refine the tools needed to feasibly assess physical activity in young and old adults. These accomplishments will directly impact the fields of epidemiology, geriatric medicine, rehabilitation, and nutritional sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will advance the understanding the differences in the metabolic costs of daily activities due to old age and functional impairment. This is highly relevant to NIH's mission of promoting health by reducing the burdens of physical disability in old age.",Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults,9084415,R01AG042525,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Americas', 'Ankle', 'Beds', 'Body Weight', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nutritional Science', 'Orthopedics', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Gas Exchange', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'falls', 'fitness', 'forest', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical methods', 'metabolic rate', 'middle age', 'milliliter', 'psychologic', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2016,341674,0.018678386707385905
"Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] needed for older adults to maintain optimal physical function is unknown. Institute of Medicine and Endocrine Society have publicly debated on 20 ng/mL or 30 ng/mL, respectively, as targets for skeletal health, but both groups agree that stronger evidence is needed to identify target concentrations for extra-skeletal outcomes, e.g., falls and physical function. The problem is significant: >25% of older adults have poor physical function, 50% have 25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and 30 ng/mL. Identifying 25(OH)D targets for older adults will have immediate impact by informing design and analysis of vitamin D supplementation trials. Namely, targets serve as inclusion/exclusion criteria or baseline subgroups and as secondary outcomes. Our solution is to empirically identify and validate sex-specific (possibly stratified by other factors; e.g., race, genetic variants) 25(OH)D targets in older adults (= 65 years) related to lowe risk of falls and better physical function using existing NIH-funded datasets. A critical challenge is that 25(OH)D cannot be randomized; therefore observational data are a crucial part of the solution. Conventional statistical methods are ill-equipped for this problem; thus, we will develop novel statistical methods by adapting and refining structural modeling and machine-learning methods, and apply them to our aims. We will carry out the aims using 4 prospective cohort studies comprising >12,500 older adults: Health, Aging, and Body Composition, Invecchiare in Chianti, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. We will: 1) identify and validate 25(OH)D targets for falls reduction, mobility, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living (functional outcomes); and gait speed, muscle strength, and frailty (proximal conditions) (aim 1); 2) characterize the joint impact of 25(OH)D and serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations on functional outcomes/proximal conditions (aim 2); and 3) quantify mediation of 25(OH)D on functional outcomes/proximal conditions by endocrine and metabolic factors (PTH, serum alkaline phosphatase, aklotho, fibroblast growth factor 23) (aim 3). We will write code in SAS and R statistical languages and disseminate it to the scientific community for use in additional research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aging of the population is expected to lead to an increased burden of poor physical function and loss of independence. Low concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are common in older adults and may be one reason for deficits in physical function. Since 25(OH)D can easily be increased by sunlight exposure, diet, and supplements; identifying and validating a target 25(OH)D for functional outcomes in older adults can have a significant impact on public health.",Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults,9147536,R01AG048069,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Body mass index', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gait speed', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Living', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intake', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'PTH gene', 'Phosphorus', 'Physical Function', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Sun Exposure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Woman', 'Writing', 'aging population', 'bone', 'bone health', 'calcium intake', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic variant', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'sarcopenia', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'skeletal', 'ultraviolet']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2016,321959,0.08859277000093538
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.            ",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9026192,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Analgesics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,578991,0.012641549366951565
"Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Richard D. Boyce, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has training in informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research as well as a strong commitment to improving medication safety for older adults. His prior work has focused on artificial intelligence methods for predicting drug-drug interactions and the comparative safety of antidepressants for treating de-pressed nursing home residents. The current proposal is for a three year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that will address gaps in his knowledge of aging research and the nursing home setting. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Charles Reynolds, Jordan Karp, and Steven Handler) he has developed a training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on how to effectively translate research results from pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research to informatics interventions that improve medication safety for older adults, especially nursing home residents. To accomplish this goal, he proposes eight career development activities and two research aims that will help him 1) obtain rigorous training in the science and practice of creating clinical decision support interventions that are effective in the nursing home setting; 2) obtain a thorough understanding of how falls and fall risk factors are detected, monitored, reported, and assessed in the nursing home setting; and 3) learn the perceptions of multiple nursing home clinician stakeholders on what research is needed to help reduce medication-related adverse events. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by exploring the feasibility and potential clinical usefulness of actively monitoring patients exposed to psycho- tropic PDDIs. The approach would use electronic data available in most United States (US) NHs to provide highly specific and actionable alerts to physicians and/or nurses when a resident who is exposed to a PDDI involving a psychotropic drug transitions to a state of unacceptably high risk for experiencing a fall. Dr. Boyce's hypothesis is that this approach will extend the ability of NH clinicians to perform the recommended ""diligent monitoring"" of PDDIs, while avoiding alert fatigue. He anticipates that the approach would be generalizable to other prevalent NH ADEs (e.g., delirium) and other drug classes (e.g., mood stabilizers). This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore an innovative approach to managing PDDIs that may ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls).

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will impact public health by providing quantitative and qualitative pilot data that will inform the design of an intervention that should ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls).

"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9242212,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2016,162518,0.07221116368957328
"A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults Abstract  People aged 65+ will represent 21% of the U.S. population and increase to about 80 million by 2040, and the oldest old (age 85+) will number ~ 14.1 million. Population aging presents both opportunities and challenges for our healthcare, the economy, and existing social support systems. Many older adults especially the oldest old, minorities and those of lower Socio-Economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, poor diet, and decreased levels of physical activity each of which influence morbidity and mortality. Mobile-based, tablet-based, and in-home technologies provide an excellent opportunity for projecting behavior- change interventions and social support into the everyday life of older adults at great economies of scale. The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system, designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2) the Fittle+ mobile platform designed to support positive health behavior change through integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence (AI). The study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1 we will develop and pilot test the FSS with representative samples of older adults. Phase 2 will involve a two group randomized trial where participants will be randomized to the Fittle Senior System (FSS, an adaptive coaching and social support system using mobile technology) or to a paper-based psycho-educational (BPE) control condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at risk for social isolation (90 per condition - 30 White Caucasians, 30 Black/African Americans and 30 Hispanic Americans). We will recruit males and females commensurate to the gender proportions represented in this age group and work to ensure that we have sufficient representation from the “oldest old” cohort. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on clinically significant measures of health and health behaviors and indices of social support. We will also gather information on potential moderating (e.g., ethnicity, age) and mediating variables (e.g., health self-efficacy), which will be examined using multilevel modeling techniques guided by current theories of behavior change and technology acceptance and use among older adults. Project Narrative This proposed project is addressing a critical public concern. The population is aging and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are common among older adults especially ethnic minorities. This study will develop and evaluate a mobile technology-based intervention designed to support positive health behavior change among diverse older adults through integrated online social support, personalized coaching and goal setting.",A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults,9147924,R01AG053163,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caucasians', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational Materials', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Industry', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Jordan', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Support System', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'active method', 'age group', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinically significant', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'dynamic system', 'education research', 'efficacy trial', 'ethnic minority population', 'family structure', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'low socioeconomic status', 'male', 'medical schools', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'nutrition', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2016,834282,0.04272646449670042
"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar. The outcome of this work will result in automated health assessments that make use of smart technology, recommendations for improving the ecological validity of office-based clinical assessments, automated real-time intervention methods that can help support preventative health care measures, and clinically-relevant, user-friendly interfaces for integration of smart home data into health records. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smar home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to gather validated activity and health related information that can be used by the medical community to improve the efficacy of traditional assessment and support ecological momentary intervention techniques. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance,9103121,R01EB009675,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Software Design', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'computer science', 'coping', 'cost effective', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology development', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,333930,0.059964002513255704
"NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed project aims at developing a novel quadrupedal human-assistive robotic platform (Q-HARP}, with the objective of helping the large number of elderly individuals live a healthy, physically active life style. The Q-HARP primarily functions as a smart power-assist walker: a user, situated in the center of the legged robot, can enjoy the desired amount of power assist in walking according to his/her intent. As such, a Q-HARP user is able to perform an appropriate amount of physical activity, while enjoying the enhanced level of mobility during his/her daily lif. Furthermore, with the Q-HARP's legged motion, the human-robot system can easily overcome most obstacles in the daily life. With this capability, the Q-HARP has a potential of becoming a basic building block for Aging-in-Place, enabling elderly individuals to stay in their home longer without conducting costly modification to their existing home structures. To develop this innovative robot, the investigators will conduct research in various aspects of the project. The specific aims of the project are: AIM 1) Understand user needs and promote user involvement in the research process; AIM 2) Create a systematic design framework for the human-assistive quadrupedal robot, and build robot prototypes for experimental testing; AIM 3) Develop a 3D computer vision-based approach for motion and environment detection; AIM 4) Study the human assistive strategies in assistive walking and emergency response; AIM 5) Develop an intelligent robot control system for interactive assistance in locomotion; AIM 6) Conduct experiments to test the robot performance in human assistance tasks. The project's potential bene*fits to society are substantial. By 2030, there will be 71 million older adults living in the S, accounting for 20°/o of the entire population. For the health and well ness of older adults, a key contributing factor is to be physically active. However, a large number of older adults have significant difficulty in staying physically active due to mobility impairment. By providing desire physical assistance in the coordinated locomotion, the Q-HARP is anticipated to restore an elderly person's mobility, keep him/her physically active, and enjoy a more healthy life with reduced reliance on the assistance of caregivers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The human-assistive robotic platform in this proposal has a potential of promoting and improving the health and well ness of the large elderly population in the US, and thus is in direct support of NINR's mission. Specifically, it fits well into the theme of ""Wellness: Promoting Health and Preventing Illness"" by helping elderly individuals to stay physically active and prevent the illnesses associated with the sedentary lifestyle.",NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP),9132846,R01NR016151,"['Accounting', 'Aging', 'Caregivers', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Emergency response', 'Environment', 'Equine mule', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Locomotion', 'Mental Depression', 'Mission', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Walkers', 'Walking', 'aging population', 'base', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'robot control', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2016,125000,0.057183459762206956
"A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of adults age � 65 years have high blood pressure (BP), but optimal management of high BP in the elderly remains controversial. Contrary to evidence in middle age that lowering BP is clearly beneficial, data in older adults are inconsistent and high BP may not be a risk factor in all elders. We recently reported that, among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey age e65 years, high BP was a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death only among persons in better health status (defined as fast walking of a 20-ft walk test). In contrast, high BP was not a risk factor among slow walkers. Additionally, the benefit of lowering BP in all elders remains an issue of debate; a recent meta-analysis in persons age 80 years and older reported no benefit of BP treatment on mortality, and significant heterogeneity across trials. Finally, there is growin concern for potential harms associated with treatment to lower BP. Excessive lowering of BP, particularly diastolic, has been associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in some studies. In the proposed research, we propose a novel paradigm where the associations of BP with adverse outcomes in older persons are considered in the setting of the complex aging process. Our long-term goal is to reliably identify elderly persons in whom BP treatment is beneficial and those in whom treatment is ineffective or even harmful, by defining subpopulations of similar health status. Specifically, aim 1 proposes to elucidate factors from four domains (functional, cognitive/mental, self-rated health, and physiologic) that can identify elderly persons in whom high systolic BP is strongly associated with higher risk for death and CV events, and those in whom it is not, using data from three NIH-funded cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) and Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA). In aim 2, we will evaluate the role of diastolic BP across level of health status. Finally, based on findings from these observational cohorts, in aim 3 we will evaluate whether these factors can identify elderly persons in whom treatment to lower BP is of maximum benefit in two randomized controlled trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SHEP) and the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3). Since participants in trials are healthier than the U.S. population, we will also evaluate the effect of treatment in the observational studies, using state-of-the-art causal inference methods, which can correct for the bias of standard analytic approaches. Completion of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the importance of high BP in older adults; will improve our ability to identify elderly persons who will benefit from BP treatment; will allow a systematic understanding of groups in whom evidence for BP treatment is lacking; and will guide design of future trials of hypertension in elderly adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Treatment of high blood pressure in elderly persons remains controversial. This proposal focuses on developing systematic methods to understand which elderly persons benefit from lowering blood pressure. This question is of great relevance as U.S. elders are living longer than any prior generation, and the majority have high blood pressure.",A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age,8925759,R01AG046206,"['Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walkers', 'Walking', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'evidence base', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'novel', 'systolic hypertension', 'treatment effect']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2016,309383,0.042156573287503905
"Working Memory Training in Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that cognitive interventions targeting working memory are beneficial in that they show generalizing effects that go beyond what has been specifically trained, i.e. transfer effects. Although it seems more difficult to observe such transfer effects in older adults as compared to young adults or children, we and others have found that some interventions do show promise in older populations. Despite the promising results, more research is needed to make our interventions more effective and more robust, and to uncover the underlying mechanisms of training in an aging population. For our proposed studies, we envision two lines of research with different goals: First, we aim to address questions of pragmatics. Our goal here is to make our intervention more accessible and inviting for participants, thus increasing their motivation to participate effectively in training regimens. In addition, we will investigate the intervention's optimal scheduling (i.e., spacing of practice), and explore whether the improvements extend to measures of everyday functioning, and finally, investigate longitudinal effects and their trajectories over the course of one year after training completion. These are our applied goals. Second, we propose to address the most important questions of any intervention research: The investigation of the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of improvement. Furthermore, we will shed light on individual differences as moderating factors for training success. These are our mechanistic goals. Given the sparse availability of effective cognitive interventions, and the limited knowledge about their generalizing effects to applied measures of daily living, the proposed work will have important implications in that it will shed more light on the mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in old age, and serve as groundwork for future large-scale randomized clinical trials and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The vast majority of our nation's aging population will experience some decline in cognitive function with age. Therefore, the development of effective preventative interventions to mitigate age-related cognitive decline is of critical importance in that those interventions could not only impact older adults' cognitive and daily life functioning, but ultimately, contribute to their well-being and quality of life. The proposed work will have important implications in that it will get at the underlying mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in ld age, and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted cognitive interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia.",Working Memory Training in Older Adults,9145147,R01AG049006,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Financial compensation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Motivation', 'Older Population', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Self Efficacy', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specificity', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'active control', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'success', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2016,606591,0.008113992544201342
"Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses neuroimaging to enrich our understanding of the impact of negative aging stereotypes on cognitive performance in older adults - a phenomenon known as ""stereotype threat"". We will identify task-related brain activity associated with stereotype threat, and the extent to which individual beliefs in memory ability, stereotype self-relevance, and anxiety mediate these neural effects. We also will test two hypothesized mechanisms of threat, using traditional fMRI methods and novel pattern classifier techniques. This project will inform theories of ageist stereotype threat at the psychological and neural level, which is critical for disentangling the effects of aging-related neural decline and social factors on brain activity. The impact of stereotype threat on cognitive tests has significan public health implications, not only for cognitive functioning in daily life, but because cognitive tests are used to diagnose the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. To the extent that threat impairs performance on these tests, an individual's true cognitive ability would be underestimated. In our study, cognitively normal older adults will be explicitly exposed to negative stereotypes about aging memory (threat condition) or a positive, age-fair framing of the task (control condition). Next, during fMRI, they will take a recollection task known to be sensitive to aging stereotype threat effects. The neural mechanisms of stereotype threat will be determined by directly comparing brain activity between the threat and control groups, as well as comparisons to brain activity in younger adult groups that are tested in conditions that simulate the cognitive processes thought to drive stereotype threat. In determining which neural mechanisms drive stereotype threat in aging populations, we hope to minimize the negative impact of ageist stereotypes on older adults, in daily cognitive routines and in medical settings where cognitive tests are used for diagnosis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research studies ageist stereotype effects on cognition, using psychological measures and neuroimaging to identify the causes of stereotype effects in different people. Understanding stereotypes can help individuals avoid them, thereby increasing the well-being of older adults.            ",Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition,9061560,R21AG049931,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age difference', 'age related', 'anxiety states', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'emotion regulation', 'expectation', 'interest', 'mental state', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'social', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2016,197500,0.02480976569520076
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,9012784,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'aging population', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'support network', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2016,2214679,0.04738251163711153
"Chronic Conditions and Mutuality of Care in Late Life Marriage:A Multi-method App DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% experience functional disability. Thus, married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditios and disability of their own but also their spouse's. Understanding how support dynamics in marriage influence each partner's health will provide great insight into helping couples stay healthier and functionally independent into late life. The aim of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA) is to train the candidate in epidemiology of aging and advanced dyadic data analysis techniques to build on her expertise in experimental research and to understand how mutual care in late-life marriage influence health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression, and longevity. The proposed research focuses on older couples in which both partners suffer from chronic conditions and disability, and drawing from communal relationships theory, mutual care is defined as both partners receiving high levels of balanced instrumental and emotional support from one another. Through this MRSDA, the candidate will (1) learn from expert mentors and consultants about the epidemiology of aging and advanced statistical techniques to analyze dyadic, longitudinal data, (2) conduct secondary analysis on a large epidemiologic dyadic data set to examine how mutual care in older adult marriages influences long-term health and longevity and an experiment to examine a proposed mechanism, cardiovascular stress recovery, (3) complete coursework in epidemiology of aging, advanced epidemiologic statistics, and research ethics, and (4) attend workshops on dyadic data analysis. Yale University is a phenomenal environment to pursue this training as it has extensive resources in epidemiology of aging, statistics for analyzing epidemiologic data, experimental relationships research, and cardiovascular psychophysiology. The candidate has a state-of-the- art observational and psychophysiology lab that she will utilize for this project. Th Yale School of Public Health and the Claude D. Pepper Older American's Independence Center at Yale have excellent junior faculty mentoring programs. The candidate's primary mentor, Dr. Becca Levy at Yale School of Public Health has extensive expertise in bridging experimental and epidemiological methods to study psychosocial factors and health in older adults, including dyads. Dr. Richard Schulz will serve as a co-mentor, as he is the primary investigator for the Cardiovascular Health Effects Study which will be used for Study 1 of the proposed research and is an expert in conducting large, longitudinal studies. Dr. Trace Kershaw, an expert in dyadic data analysis at Yale School of Public Health, will also be a co-mentor. The proposed training will occur in the context of (1) a longitudinal study of married couples in which both members of the couple have chronic conditions and disability (Study 1; The Caregiver Health Effects Study; n=819 couples; an ancillary study to the Cardiovascular Health Study) examining the influence of mutual support on health trajectories (e.g. clinical and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease, clinical depression, and self-reported health) and longevity, and (2) an experimental study (Study 2; n=100 couples) examining cardiovascular stress recovery, a proposed mechanism for the link between mutual care and cardiovascular health proposed in Study 1. In the experimental study each partner will discuss a health-related stressor, and mutual support will be manipulated and compared to a control and one-sided support conditions to examine the effects on cardiovascular stress recovery. Consistent with the priorities outlined by the National Institute on Aging, the proposed MRSDA has the potential to address mechanisms for links between interpersonal relationships and health in the context of aging (RFA: PA-11-128). Further, the combination of training and research will serve as a spring board for the candidate's independent research career to elucidate how interpersonal relationships influence health among older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% are functionally disabled.

"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI. The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years. One of our overarching goals is to achieve a highly useful 7T clinical utility, which requires high quality, robust, and consistent acquisitions. This could be a potentially exclusive (over other human MRI field strengths) application for 7T imaging.",High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression,9196861,R01MH111265,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Consultations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Edema', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Gliosis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heating', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'Work', 'absorption', 'abstracting', 'aging brain', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disturbance in affect', 'follow-up', 'geriatric depression', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'radiofrequency', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'vascular depression']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,685522,0.08713987921176702
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exercise is arguably the most potent approach we can take to defer physical decline associated with aging and to protect against late onset diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Molecular understanding of how exercise benefits translate into healthy aging is thus of definitive medical interest. We study fundamental processes relevant to healthy aging in the 959-celled nematode C. elegans. Recently we made a fascinating discovery-C. elegans can exercise (swim) to exhibit training benefits, and appear to gain benefits by molecular pathways conserved in humans. Our initial model development opens up a new research area for understanding how tissue-specific and organism-wide health benefits are induced by exercise, and creates a novel paradigm for identifying exercise mimetic drugs that might promote healthy aging. To really harvest the potential of this model, we need to measure the strength of the tiny C. elegans. We collaborated to develop a strength test in which trained animals thread through a matrix of deformable pillars, and the extent of pillar deflection is used to calculate force. Our ""NemaFlex"" force detection device is the quantitative foundation with which we expect to break new ground in understanding exercise impact on healthy aging. Here we propose required development to enhance assay throughput and pursue applications that will not only anchor this technology as an essential component of C. elegans exercise evaluation but also accelerate studies on exercise biology and healthy aging in this powerful model. Aim 1 is to develop a novel high throughput tool for direct strength evaluation in C. elegans.  This aim will generate an essential tool for analysis of C. elegans strength at multiple life stages, define the exercise regimen that will become the anchor protocol in the field, and reveal features of training in this model. Aim 2 is to use NemaFlex to evaluate exercise mimetic drugs & to facilitate focused pilot genetic screens. This aim will establish critical proof-of-principle for genetic and drug discovery using the NemaFlex. Aim 3 is to initiate dissection of the functional and molecular relationship between exercise and healthy aging, grounded in NemaFlex force measures of training benefits.  To begin, we will test how optimized strength training tracks with a broad spectrum of healthspan indicators that decline with age, we will investigate impact of cessation of training on aging quality, and we will ask if exercise mimetic drugs extend healthspan in the absence of training. Our goals will create novel technology that for the first time permits facile quantitativ analysis of exercise adaptations in the powerful C. elegans genetic model. Accomplishment of our tractable aims will anchor a new subfield of genetic investigation of exercise and healthy aging that may influence design of interventions that broadly promote health and defer aging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Exercise has a profound positive impact on health of the aging population in that it protects against age-associated diseases including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, at the same time it maintains muscle, immune system, and nervous system function in aging. We are developing the first exercise model in the simple animal C. elegans, in which training benefits appear mediated by conserved mechanisms and exercise promotes healthy aging. We will optimize a novel tool for direct strength measurement of these tiny 959-celled animals and show how our device can facilitate searches for exercise mimetic drugs and genes that are associated with training adaptations, and can also help define exercise impact on a broad range of healthy aging measures. The experimental advantages of C. elegans may yield unexpected insights that inspire development of novel interventions that protect against age-associated disease and age-associated decline.",A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans,9116734,R21AG050503,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biology of Aging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pump', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Swimming', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'age-related muscle loss', 'aging population', 'anti aging', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'exercise regimen', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'strength training', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIA,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,184503,-0.0030280208409255234
"Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults spend over 8 hours per day sitting, more than any other age group. High sedentary time has now been associated with adverse health impacts (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease related mortality) independent from physical activity. This suggests that research explicitly focusing on sedentary behavior is warranted. To further the field of sedentary behavior research among older adults with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, three gaps will be addressed: 1) improving measures of sedentary time using advanced technology-based methods (due to limitations of self-reports and traditional accelerometer data processing techniques); 2) understanding relationships between sedentary time and cardio-metabolic biomarkers and health conditions; and, 3) developing technology-based interventions to reduce sedentary time. The iSTAND (Investigating Sedentary Time in Aging: New Directions using technology) Project aims to address these gaps using data from 3 rich sources (Successful Aging Evaluation [SAGE] Study, the Women's Health Initiative [WHI] Long Life Study, and a participant pool from a large integrated health care system). In the first research aim, objective measurement techniques for sedentary time (e.g. accelerometers, SenseCam, machine learning algorithms) are explored (Aim 1a), and machine learning algorithms for accelerometer data are applied to the WHI sample to examine relationships between sedentary time and health risk factors among older women (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, focus groups will be conducted to inform development of a technology-based sedentary time reduction program targeting older adults with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease. In a pilot intervention, the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be tested in 40 older aduls with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease from a large integrated health care system. The research plans dovetail with training plans for Dr. Rosenberg to obtain necessary skills and knowledge in 2 key areas where she has deficits: 1) wireless technologies to measure sedentary time more accurately, and, 2) application of wireless technologies to sedentary time reduction interventions among older adults. The project will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (bioinformatics, technology and measurement, geriatrics, statistics) and knowledge obtained through training experiences, coursework, and conferences. Support from this 4-year patient-oriented research career development award will position Dr. Rosenberg to lead an independent research program in using technology decrease sedentary time among older adults with chronic health conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sedentary behaviors (activities done in a seated or lying down position, such as watching television) are associated with many adverse health impacts. Older adults with chronic conditions engage in high levels of sedentary time, yet sedentary time is an understudied behavioral risk. This project will leverage technology advancements to measure sedentary time and examine relationships with health risk factors. It will also develop a technology-based program to reduce sedentary time and support healthy aging in the growing population of older adults with chronic health conditions.",Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND),8919443,K23HL119352,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hour', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wireless Technology', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'frailty', 'group intervention', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light intensity', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'older women', 'patient oriented research', 'population based', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'sedentary', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'tool', 'tv watching']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,K23,2015,140097,0.09025032908403709
"Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     PROJECT SUMMARY Sleep disorders are highly prevalent and are associated with substantial adverse consequences including motor vehicle and other accidents, impaired cognition, impaired immune function, altered mood, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. The gold standard test for assessing the physiology of sleep is the polysomnogram suffers from a number of well-recognized limitations. These limitations decrease the capacity of sleep researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from sleep disorders. (PSG). Currently employed PSG technology Our long-term goal is to address the shortcomings of current PSG methodology by developing a low cost, low for automated assessment of sleep physiology. We hypothesize that this would be possible by expanding the types of brain assessments carried out to include near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) where recent evidence suggests that the low frequency hemodynamic oscillation reflect sleep stage-related changes in brain function. NIRS also simultaneously provides cerebral oxygen saturation, heart rate and breathing rate estimates. In this application, we propose to design, build, and test power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system a proof-of-principle prototype system combining diffuse optical spectroscopic, electrophysiological, and inertial . This system will have the form factor of an adhesive bandage which will disturb and limit subjects to a far lesser degree than traditional PSG systems. We will use supervised machine learning-based methods to explore NIRS features specific to sleep stages and clinically relevant events. Other innovations include recording inertial signals and incorporating adaptive signal processing in order to remove artifacts and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR), and using commercial-off-the-shelf proximity sensor circuitry to support the NIRS front-end. measurement capabilities If successful, this project will lead to improved capacity to carry out sleep research and to detect and treat sleep disorders. The proposed methodology would test whether novel clinically relevant NIRS parameters can be explored enabling further understanding of sleep physiology. The miniaturization, low cost, and low power consumption of our new NIRS-based wireless system would pave the way for rapid adoption and deployment of these bandages for home-use in real-world settings. Given the high prevalence and substantial impairments associated with sleep disorders, this project has the potential to have a major positive impact on public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative A review carried out by the Institute of Medicine concluded that 50-70 million people in the United States suffer from a chronic disorder of sleep and wakefulness which diminishes their ability to function, adversely impacts their health, and decreases longevity. Current systems for objectively monitoring sleep physiology and diagnosing sleep disorders suffer from a number of widely-recognized shortcomings that limit the capacity of researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and sleep disorders and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from these conditions.

"Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans spend over 90% of their activity related energy expenditure performing common daily activities. Health care professionals use normative data as a guide to prescribe appropriate activities for patients and clients. Additionally, scientists use this resource to plan physical activity or nutritional interventions ad apply these estimates to epidemiological research. However, while normative data have existed for over 20 years and are seemingly accurate in young adults, they can lead to misguided estimates of the metabolic cost of daily activities in older adults. This is not a trivial issue sice physical activity is one of the only known modalities to improve physical function in older adults and plays a critical role in regulating body weight. However, there is a serious lack of information pertaining to potential age-related differences in the metabolic cost of daily activitis. This leaves a major gap in knowledge for properly prescribing physical activity for a population that has elevated risk cardiopulmonary and orthopedic impairments. The primary goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that aging is associated with a difference in the metabolic cost f doing exercise and lifestyle activities. We will assess pulmonary gas exchange in 210 adults aged 20 to 80+ years with a portable indirect calorimeter worn while performing 38 daily activities. We will examine the metabolic equivalent (MET as a function of 3.5 milliliter"" min-1""kg-1), metabolic economy (energy expended for a given work rate) and relative metabolic cost (as a function of resting and peak oxygen consumption) for each task as a function of age. Secondly, we will address how metabolic costs of daily activities are affected by having functional impairments by testing an additional 90 older adults (60+ years) with functional impairment. Thirdly, because scientists and public health officials alike rely on perception-based exertion to monitor intensity of physical activity, we will address the question- ""Is aging associated with inaccuracies for self-gauging perceived exertion?"" Addressing this question will gain insight into a better delivery system for recommending physical intensity to older adults. Lastly, the design and comprehensive metabolic measurements being proposed will provide an unprecedented opportunity to validate accelerometers for estimating the type and intensity of physical activity. Using new mathematical techniques that apply machine learning approaches (random forests, support vector and multiple kernel learning techniques), we will assess the potential to reduce the error in estimating the type and intensity of physical activity as compared to traditional methods. There are many end products of this research. First, the work will produce the largest dataset of metabolic cost for daily activities in 60+ years old. Second, an age-correction factor for metabolic costs will be created to apply to hundreds of tasks that fall into similar categories as those being evaluated. Finally, the work will refine the tools needed to feasibly assess physical activity in young and old adults. These accomplishments will directly impact the fields of epidemiology, geriatric medicine, rehabilitation, and nutritional sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will advance the understanding the differences in the metabolic costs of daily activities due to old age and functional impairment. This is highly relevant to NIH's mission of promoting health by reducing the burdens of physical disability in old age.",Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults,8904579,R01AG042525,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Americas', 'Ankle', 'Beds', 'Body Weight', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nutritional Science', 'Orthopedics', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Gas Exchange', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'falls', 'fitness', 'forest', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical methods', 'metabolic rate', 'middle age', 'milliliter', 'psychologic', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2015,330803,0.018678386707385905
"Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] needed for older adults to maintain optimal physical function is unknown. Institute of Medicine and Endocrine Society have publicly debated on 20 ng/mL or 30 ng/mL, respectively, as targets for skeletal health, but both groups agree that stronger evidence is needed to identify target concentrations for extra-skeletal outcomes, e.g., falls and physical function. The problem is significant: >25% of older adults have poor physical function, 50% have 25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and 30 ng/mL. Identifying 25(OH)D targets for older adults will have immediate impact by informing design and analysis of vitamin D supplementation trials. Namely, targets serve as inclusion/exclusion criteria or baseline subgroups and as secondary outcomes. Our solution is to empirically identify and validate sex-specific (possibly stratified by other factors; e.g., race, genetic variants) 25(OH)D targets in older adults (= 65 years) related to lowe risk of falls and better physical function using existing NIH-funded datasets. A critical challenge is that 25(OH)D cannot be randomized; therefore observational data are a crucial part of the solution. Conventional statistical methods are ill-equipped for this problem; thus, we will develop novel statistical methods by adapting and refining structural modeling and machine-learning methods, and apply them to our aims. We will carry out the aims using 4 prospective cohort studies comprising >12,500 older adults: Health, Aging, and Body Composition, Invecchiare in Chianti, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. We will: 1) identify and validate 25(OH)D targets for falls reduction, mobility, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living (functional outcomes); and gait speed, muscle strength, and frailty (proximal conditions) (aim 1); 2) characterize the joint impact of 25(OH)D and serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations on functional outcomes/proximal conditions (aim 2); and 3) quantify mediation of 25(OH)D on functional outcomes/proximal conditions by endocrine and metabolic factors (PTH, serum alkaline phosphatase, aklotho, fibroblast growth factor 23) (aim 3). We will write code in SAS and R statistical languages and disseminate it to the scientific community for use in additional research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aging of the population is expected to lead to an increased burden of poor physical function and loss of independence. Low concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are common in older adults and may be one reason for deficits in physical function. Since 25(OH)D can easily be increased by sunlight exposure, diet, and supplements; identifying and validating a target 25(OH)D for functional outcomes in older adults can have a significant impact on public health.                ",Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults,8885952,R01AG048069,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Body mass index', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dietary intake', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hormones', 'Independent Living', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intake', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Parathyroid gland', 'Phosphorus', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Solutions', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Sun Exposure', 'Supplementation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vitamin D', 'Woman', 'Writing', 'bone', 'bone health', 'calcium intake', 'cohort', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic variant', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'men', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sarcopenia', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'skeletal', 'ultraviolet']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2015,356753,0.08859277000093538
"Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Richard D. Boyce, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has training in informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research as well as a strong commitment to improving medication safety for older adults. His prior work has focused on artificial intelligence methods for predicting drug-drug interactions and the comparative safety of antidepressants for treating de-pressed nursing home residents. The current proposal is for a three year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that will address gaps in his knowledge of aging research and the nursing home setting. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Charles Reynolds, Jordan Karp, and Steven Handler) he has developed a training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on how to effectively translate research results from pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research to informatics interventions that improve medication safety for older adults, especially nursing home residents. To accomplish this goal, he proposes eight career development activities and two research aims that will help him 1) obtain rigorous training in the science and practice of creating clinical decision support interventions that are effective in the nursing home setting; 2) obtain a thorough understanding of how falls and fall risk factors are detected, monitored, reported, and assessed in the nursing home setting; and 3) learn the perceptions of multiple nursing home clinician stakeholders on what research is needed to help reduce medication-related adverse events. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by exploring the feasibility and potential clinical usefulness of actively monitoring patients exposed to psycho- tropic PDDIs. The approach would use electronic data available in most United States (US) NHs to provide highly specific and actionable alerts to physicians and/or nurses when a resident who is exposed to a PDDI involving a psychotropic drug transitions to a state of unacceptably high risk for experiencing a fall. Dr. Boyce's hypothesis is that this approach will extend the ability of NH clinicians to perform the recommended ""diligent monitoring"" of PDDIs, while avoiding alert fatigue. He anticipates that the approach would be generalizable to other prevalent NH ADEs (e.g., delirium) and other drug classes (e.g., mood stabilizers). This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore an innovative approach to managing PDDIs that may ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). It wil also inform an R-series grant proposal to study a mature intervention that Dr. Boyce plans to submit in year 2 of the project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will impact public health by providing quantitative and qualitative pilot data that will inform the design of an intervention that should ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). The work will also provide a solid research basis for future active monitoring interventios targeting a broader set of PDDIs and other adverse events (e.g., delirium) prevalent in the NH setting.",Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr,8776906,K01AG044433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Detection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Group Interviews', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness research', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'hypnotic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prototype', 'sedative', 'therapy design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2015,114082,0.01564708621800078
"NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed project aims at developing a novel quadrupedal human-assistive robotic platform (Q-HARP}, with the objective of helping the large number of elderly individuals live a healthy, physically active life style. The Q-HARP primarily functions as a smart power-assist walker: a user, situated in the center of the legged robot, can enjoy the desired amount of power assist in walking according to his/her intent. As such, a Q-HARP user is able to perform an appropriate amount of physical activity, while enjoying the enhanced level of mobility during his/her daily lif. Furthermore, with the Q-HARP's legged motion, the human-robot system can easily overcome most obstacles in the daily life. With this capability, the Q-HARP has a potential of becoming a basic building block for Aging-in-Place, enabling elderly individuals to stay in their home longer without conducting costly modification to their existing home structures. To develop this innovative robot, the investigators will conduct research in various aspects of the project. The specific aims of the project are: AIM 1) Understand user needs and promote user involvement in the research process; AIM 2) Create a systematic design framework for the human-assistive quadrupedal robot, and build robot prototypes for experimental testing; AIM 3) Develop a 3D computer vision-based approach for motion and environment detection; AIM 4) Study the human assistive strategies in assistive walking and emergency response; AIM 5) Develop an intelligent robot control system for interactive assistance in locomotion; AIM 6) Conduct experiments to test the robot performance in human assistance tasks. The project's potential bene*fits to society are substantial. By 2030, there will be 71 million older adults living in the S, accounting for 20°/o of the entire population. For the health and well ness of older adults, a key contributing factor is to be physically active. However, a large number of older adults have significant difficulty in staying physically active due to mobility impairment. By providing desire physical assistance in the coordinated locomotion, the Q-HARP is anticipated to restore an elderly person's mobility, keep him/her physically active, and enjoy a more healthy life with reduced reliance on the assistance of caregivers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The human-assistive robotic platform in this proposal has a potential of promoting and improving the health and well ness of the large elderly population in the US, and thus is in direct support of NINR's mission. Specifically, it fits well into the theme of ""Wellness: Promoting Health and Preventing Illness"" by helping elderly individuals to stay physically active and prevent the illnesses associated with the sedentary lifestyle.",NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP),9052390,R01NR016151,"['Accounting', 'Aging', 'Caregivers', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Emergency response', 'Environment', 'Equine mule', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Locomotion', 'Mental Depression', 'Mission', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Walkers', 'Walking', 'base', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2015,125000,0.057183459762206956
"Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses neuroimaging to enrich our understanding of the impact of negative aging stereotypes on cognitive performance in older adults - a phenomenon known as ""stereotype threat"". We will identify task-related brain activity associated with stereotype threat, and the extent to which individual beliefs in memory ability, stereotype self-relevance, and anxiety mediate these neural effects. We also will test two hypothesized mechanisms of threat, using traditional fMRI methods and novel pattern classifier techniques. This project will inform theories of ageist stereotype threat at the psychological and neural level, which is critical for disentangling the effects of aging-related neural decline and social factors on brain activity. The impact of stereotype threat on cognitive tests has significan public health implications, not only for cognitive functioning in daily life, but because cognitive tests are used to diagnose the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. To the extent that threat impairs performance on these tests, an individual's true cognitive ability would be underestimated. In our study, cognitively normal older adults will be explicitly exposed to negative stereotypes about aging memory (threat condition) or a positive, age-fair framing of the task (control condition). Next, during fMRI, they will take a recollection task known to be sensitive to aging stereotype threat effects. The neural mechanisms of stereotype threat will be determined by directly comparing brain activity between the threat and control groups, as well as comparisons to brain activity in younger adult groups that are tested in conditions that simulate the cognitive processes thought to drive stereotype threat. In determining which neural mechanisms drive stereotype threat in aging populations, we hope to minimize the negative impact of ageist stereotypes on older adults, in daily cognitive routines and in medical settings where cognitive tests are used for diagnosis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research studies ageist stereotype effects on cognition, using psychological measures and neuroimaging to identify the causes of stereotype effects in different people. Understanding stereotypes can help individuals avoid them, thereby increasing the well-being of older adults.            ",Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition,8868661,R21AG049931,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age difference', 'age related', 'anxiety states', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'emotion regulation', 'expectation', 'interest', 'mental state', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'social', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2015,237000,0.02480976569520076
"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar. The outcome of this work will result in automated health assessments that make use of smart technology, recommendations for improving the ecological validity of office-based clinical assessments, automated real-time intervention methods that can help support preventative health care measures, and clinically-relevant, user-friendly interfaces for integration of smart home data into health records. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smar home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to gather validated activity and health related information that can be used by the medical community to improve the efficacy of traditional assessment and support ecological momentary intervention techniques. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance,8935770,R01EB009675,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Software Design', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'computer science', 'coping', 'cost effective', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology development', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,327802,0.059964002513255704
"Working Memory Training in Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that cognitive interventions targeting working memory are beneficial in that they show generalizing effects that go beyond what has been specifically trained, i.e. transfer effects. Although it seems more difficult to observe such transfer effects in older adults as compared to young adults or children, we and others have found that some interventions do show promise in older populations. Despite the promising results, more research is needed to make our interventions more effective and more robust, and to uncover the underlying mechanisms of training in an aging population. For our proposed studies, we envision two lines of research with different goals: First, we aim to address questions of pragmatics. Our goal here is to make our intervention more accessible and inviting for participants, thus increasing their motivation to participate effectively in training regimens. In addition, we will investigate the intervention's optimal scheduling (i.e., spacing of practice), and explore whether the improvements extend to measures of everyday functioning, and finally, investigate longitudinal effects and their trajectories over the course of one year after training completion. These are our applied goals. Second, we propose to address the most important questions of any intervention research: The investigation of the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of improvement. Furthermore, we will shed light on individual differences as moderating factors for training success. These are our mechanistic goals. Given the sparse availability of effective cognitive interventions, and the limited knowledge about their generalizing effects to applied measures of daily living, the proposed work will have important implications in that it will shed more light on the mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in old age, and serve as groundwork for future large-scale randomized clinical trials and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The vast majority of our nation's aging population will experience some decline in cognitive function with age. Therefore, the development of effective preventative interventions to mitigate age-related cognitive decline is of critical importance in that those interventions could not only impact older adults' cognitive and daily life functioning, but ultimately, contribute to their well-being and quality of life. The proposed work will have important implications in that it will get at the underlying mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in ld age, and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted cognitive interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia.            ",Working Memory Training in Older Adults,8907211,R01AG049006,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Financial compensation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Motivation', 'Older Population', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Populations at Risk', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Self Efficacy', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specificity', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'active control', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'success', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2015,602211,0.008113992544201342
"Molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The circadian clock regulates physiology and behavior and impinges on many aspects of our daily life. Nowhere is this more obvious than control of the sleep wake cycle, where clock genes have been shown to play a role in both the timing of sleep and its quality. For example, mutations in PER2 cause familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS), while mutations in  CSNK1E and CSNK1D cause FASPS and delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS),  respectively. However, while we have learned much about the clock and how it regulates sleep, the picture is incomplete. Behavioral studies in mice and studies in human cells show that dozens to hundreds of loci impact circadian clock function. However, only a dozen genes have been investigated for their roles in regulating behavior. Testing dozens to hundreds of mice isn't practical, so a new approach is needed. Here we seek to address this gap with a novel strategy that uses, i) integrative bioinformatics to prioritize putative core clock factors, ii) new experimental methods to determine whether they interact with known clock genes and regulate clock function in several cellular or tissue slice models, and, finally, iii) for a subset of promising candidates, generate mouse models and test them for their roles in regulating circadian behavior and sleep. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans. Our internal biological clocks control many important aspects of our physiology and behavior such as the sleep-wake cycle. Genetics and large-scale genomic studies have implicated the role of a dozen canonical and hundreds of additional new genes in the circadian clock.  However, almost none of the new genes have been studied in animal models for their ability to regulate sleep onset or quality. We will address this gap using bioinformatics, experimental biology, and finally through behavioral analysis. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans.","Molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock",8825538,R01NS054794,"['Address', 'Adipocytes', 'Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome', 'Disease', 'Fibroblasts', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Knockout Mice', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'Psyche structure', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'Slice', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'circadian pacemaker', 'data integration', 'evidence base', 'fly', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'improved', 'knockout animal', 'luminescence', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'neurogenetics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reverse genetics', 'screening', 'sleep onset', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,557700,0.04480182773592947
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,8786533,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2015,2302752,0.04738251163711153
"Chronic Conditions and Mutuality of Care in Late Life Marriage:A Multi-method App DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% experience functional disability. Thus, married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditios and disability of their own but also their spouse's. Understanding how support dynamics in marriage influence each partner's health will provide great insight into helping couples stay healthier and functionally independent into late life. The aim of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA) is to train the candidate in epidemiology of aging and advanced dyadic data analysis techniques to build on her expertise in experimental research and to understand how mutual care in late-life marriage influence health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression, and longevity. The proposed research focuses on older couples in which both partners suffer from chronic conditions and disability, and drawing from communal relationships theory, mutual care is defined as both partners receiving high levels of balanced instrumental and emotional support from one another. Through this MRSDA, the candidate will (1) learn from expert mentors and consultants about the epidemiology of aging and advanced statistical techniques to analyze dyadic, longitudinal data, (2) conduct secondary analysis on a large epidemiologic dyadic data set to examine how mutual care in older adult marriages influences long-term health and longevity and an experiment to examine a proposed mechanism, cardiovascular stress recovery, (3) complete coursework in epidemiology of aging, advanced epidemiologic statistics, and research ethics, and (4) attend workshops on dyadic data analysis. Yale University is a phenomenal environment to pursue this training as it has extensive resources in epidemiology of aging, statistics for analyzing epidemiologic data, experimental relationships research, and cardiovascular psychophysiology. The candidate has a state-of-the- art observational and psychophysiology lab that she will utilize for this project. Th Yale School of Public Health and the Claude D. Pepper Older American's Independence Center at Yale have excellent junior faculty mentoring programs. The candidate's primary mentor, Dr. Becca Levy at Yale School of Public Health has extensive expertise in bridging experimental and epidemiological methods to study psychosocial factors and health in older adults, including dyads. Dr. Richard Schulz will serve as a co-mentor, as he is the primary investigator for the Cardiovascular Health Effects Study which will be used for Study 1 of the proposed research and is an expert in conducting large, longitudinal studies. Dr. Trace Kershaw, an expert in dyadic data analysis at Yale School of Public Health, will also be a co-mentor. The proposed training will occur in the context of (1) a longitudinal study of married couples in which both members of the couple have chronic conditions and disability (Study 1; The Caregiver Health Effects Study; n=819 couples; an ancillary study to the Cardiovascular Health Study) examining the influence of mutual support on health trajectories (e.g. clinical and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease, clinical depression, and self-reported health) and longevity, and (2) an experimental study (Study 2; n=100 couples) examining cardiovascular stress recovery, a proposed mechanism for the link between mutual care and cardiovascular health proposed in Study 1. In the experimental study each partner will discuss a health-related stressor, and mutual support will be manipulated and compared to a control and one-sided support conditions to examine the effects on cardiovascular stress recovery. Consistent with the priorities outlined by the National Institute on Aging, the proposed MRSDA has the potential to address mechanisms for links between interpersonal relationships and health in the context of aging (RFA: PA-11-128). Further, the combination of training and research will serve as a spring board for the candidate's independent research career to elucidate how interpersonal relationships influence health among older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% are functionally disabled. Married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditions and disability of their own but also their spouse's.

"A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exercise is arguably the most potent approach we can take to defer physical decline associated with aging and to protect against late onset diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Molecular understanding of how exercise benefits translate into healthy aging is thus of definitive medical interest. We study fundamental processes relevant to healthy aging in the 959-celled nematode C. elegans. Recently we made a fascinating discovery-C. elegans can exercise (swim) to exhibit training benefits, and appear to gain benefits by molecular pathways conserved in humans. Our initial model development opens up a new research area for understanding how tissue-specific and organism-wide health benefits are induced by exercise, and creates a novel paradigm for identifying exercise mimetic drugs that might promote healthy aging. To really harvest the potential of this model, we need to measure the strength of the tiny C. elegans. We collaborated to develop a strength test in which trained animals thread through a matrix of deformable pillars, and the extent of pillar deflection is used to calculate force. Our ""NemaFlex"" force detection device is the quantitative foundation with which we expect to break new ground in understanding exercise impact on healthy aging. Here we propose required development to enhance assay throughput and pursue applications that will not only anchor this technology as an essential component of C. elegans exercise evaluation but also accelerate studies on exercise biology and healthy aging in this powerful model. Aim 1 is to develop a novel high throughput tool for direct strength evaluation in C. elegans.  This aim will generate an essential tool for analysis of C. elegans strength at multiple life stages, define the exercise regimen that will become the anchor protocol in the field, and reveal features of training in this model. Aim 2 is to use NemaFlex to evaluate exercise mimetic drugs & to facilitate focused pilot genetic screens. This aim will establish critical proof-of-principle for genetic and drug discovery using the NemaFlex. Aim 3 is to initiate dissection of the functional and molecular relationship between exercise and healthy aging, grounded in NemaFlex force measures of training benefits.  To begin, we will test how optimized strength training tracks with a broad spectrum of healthspan indicators that decline with age, we will investigate impact of cessation of training on aging quality, and we will ask if exercise mimetic drugs extend healthspan in the absence of training. Our goals will create novel technology that for the first time permits facile quantitativ analysis of exercise adaptations in the powerful C. elegans genetic model. Accomplishment of our tractable aims will anchor a new subfield of genetic investigation of exercise and healthy aging that may influence design of interventions that broadly promote health and defer aging.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Exercise has a profound positive impact on health of the aging population in that it protects against age-associated diseases including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, at the same time it maintains muscle, immune system, and nervous system function in aging. We are developing the first exercise model in the simple animal C. elegans, in which training benefits appear mediated by conserved mechanisms and exercise promotes healthy aging. We will optimize a novel tool for direct strength measurement of these tiny 959-celled animals and show how our device can facilitate searches for exercise mimetic drugs and genes that are associated with training adaptations, and can also help define exercise impact on a broad range of healthy aging measures. The experimental advantages of C. elegans may yield unexpected insights that inspire development of novel interventions that protect against age-associated disease and age-associated decline.              ",A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans,8936078,R21AG050503,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biology of Aging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pump', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Swimming', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aging population', 'anti aging', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'strength training', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIA,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,235630,-0.0030280208409255234
"Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults spend over 8 hours per day sitting, more than any other age group. High sedentary time has now been associated with adverse health impacts (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease related mortality) independent from physical activity. This suggests that research explicitly focusing on sedentary behavior is warranted. To further the field of sedentary behavior research among older adults with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, three gaps will be addressed: 1) improving measures of sedentary time using advanced technology-based methods (due to limitations of self-reports and traditional accelerometer data processing techniques); 2) understanding relationships between sedentary time and cardio-metabolic biomarkers and health conditions; and, 3) developing technology-based interventions to reduce sedentary time. The iSTAND (Investigating Sedentary Time in Aging: New Directions using technology) Project aims to address these gaps using data from 3 rich sources (Successful Aging Evaluation [SAGE] Study, the Women's Health Initiative [WHI] Long Life Study, and a participant pool from a large integrated health care system). In the first research aim, objective measurement techniques for sedentary time (e.g. accelerometers, SenseCam, machine learning algorithms) are explored (Aim 1a), and machine learning algorithms for accelerometer data are applied to the WHI sample to examine relationships between sedentary time and health risk factors among older women (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, focus groups will be conducted to inform development of a technology-based sedentary time reduction program targeting older adults with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease. In a pilot intervention, the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be tested in 40 older aduls with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease from a large integrated health care system. The research plans dovetail with training plans for Dr. Rosenberg to obtain necessary skills and knowledge in 2 key areas where she has deficits: 1) wireless technologies to measure sedentary time more accurately, and, 2) application of wireless technologies to sedentary time reduction interventions among older adults. The project will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (bioinformatics, technology and measurement, geriatrics, statistics) and knowledge obtained through training experiences, coursework, and conferences. Support from this 4-year patient-oriented research career development award will position Dr. Rosenberg to lead an independent research program in using technology decrease sedentary time among older adults with chronic health conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sedentary behaviors (activities done in a seated or lying down position, such as watching television) are associated with many adverse health impacts. Older adults with chronic conditions engage in high levels of sedentary time, yet sedentary time is an understudied behavioral risk. This project will leverage technology advancements to measure sedentary time and examine relationships with health risk factors. It will also develop a technology-based program to reduce sedentary time and support healthy aging in the growing population of older adults with chronic health conditions.            ",Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND),8696515,K23HL119352,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hour', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wireless Technology', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'frailty', 'group intervention', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light intensity', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'older women', 'patient oriented research', 'population based', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'satisfaction', 'sedentary', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'time use', 'tool', 'tv watching']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,K23,2014,143504,0.09025032908403709
"Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     PROJECT SUMMARY Sleep disorders are highly prevalent and are associated with substantial adverse consequences including motor vehicle and other accidents, impaired cognition, impaired immune function, altered mood, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. The gold standard test for assessing the physiology of sleep is the polysomnogram suffers from a number of well-recognized limitations. These limitations decrease the capacity of sleep researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from sleep disorders. (PSG). Currently employed PSG technology Our long-term goal is to address the shortcomings of current PSG methodology by developing a low cost, low for automated assessment of sleep physiology. We hypothesize that this would be possible by expanding the types of brain assessments carried out to include near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) where recent evidence suggests that the low frequency hemodynamic oscillation reflect sleep stage-related changes in brain function. NIRS also simultaneously provides cerebral oxygen saturation, heart rate and breathing rate estimates. In this application, we propose to design, build, and test power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system a proof-of-principle prototype system combining diffuse optical spectroscopic, electrophysiological, and inertial . This system will have the form factor of an adhesive bandage which will disturb and limit subjects to a far lesser degree than traditional PSG systems. We will use supervised machine learning-based methods to explore NIRS features specific to sleep stages and clinically relevant events. Other innovations include recording inertial signals and incorporating adaptive signal processing in order to remove artifacts and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR), and using commercial-off-the-shelf proximity sensor circuitry to support the NIRS front-end. measurement capabilities If successful, this project will lead to improved capacity to carry out sleep research and to detect and treat sleep disorders. The proposed methodology would test whether novel clinically relevant NIRS parameters can be explored enabling further understanding of sleep physiology. The miniaturization, low cost, and low power consumption of our new NIRS-based wireless system would pave the way for rapid adoption and deployment of these bandages for home-use in real-world settings. Given the high prevalence and substantial impairments associated with sleep disorders, this project has the potential to have a major positive impact on public health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative A review carried out by the Institute of Medicine concluded that 50-70 million people in the United States suffer from a chronic disorder of sleep and wakefulness which diminishes their ability to function, adversely impacts their health, and decreases longevity. Current systems for objectively monitoring sleep physiology and diagnosing sleep disorders suffer from a number of widely-recognized shortcomings that limit the capacity of researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and sleep disorders and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from these conditions. Our long term goal is to develop a low cost, low power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system for automated assessment of sleep physiology which addresses these shortcomings. The specific objective of this proposal is to investigate the capability of a miniaturized, wireless near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) system to achieve this. As such, the proposed project has the potential to improve the lives of the millions of people suffering from sleep disorders.            ",Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting,8771722,R21NS085818,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Apnea', 'Bandage', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lithium', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Movement', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plethysmography', 'Polymers', 'Polysomnography', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleeplessness', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wakefulness', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'immune function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'meetings', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'sleep onset']",NINDS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R21,2014,265759,0.0600182534540617
"Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans spend over 90% of their activity related energy expenditure performing common daily activities. Health care professionals use normative data as a guide to prescribe appropriate activities for patients and clients. Additionally, scientists use this resource to plan physical activity or nutritional interventions ad apply these estimates to epidemiological research. However, while normative data have existed for over 20 years and are seemingly accurate in young adults, they can lead to misguided estimates of the metabolic cost of daily activities in older adults. This is not a trivial issue sice physical activity is one of the only known modalities to improve physical function in older adults and plays a critical role in regulating body weight. However, there is a serious lack of information pertaining to potential age-related differences in the metabolic cost of daily activitis. This leaves a major gap in knowledge for properly prescribing physical activity for a population that has elevated risk cardiopulmonary and orthopedic impairments. The primary goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that aging is associated with a difference in the metabolic cost f doing exercise and lifestyle activities. We will assess pulmonary gas exchange in 210 adults aged 20 to 80+ years with a portable indirect calorimeter worn while performing 38 daily activities. We will examine the metabolic equivalent (MET as a function of 3.5 milliliter"" min-1""kg-1), metabolic economy (energy expended for a given work rate) and relative metabolic cost (as a function of resting and peak oxygen consumption) for each task as a function of age. Secondly, we will address how metabolic costs of daily activities are affected by having functional impairments by testing an additional 90 older adults (60+ years) with functional impairment. Thirdly, because scientists and public health officials alike rely on perception-based exertion to monitor intensity of physical activity, we will address the question- ""Is aging associated with inaccuracies for self-gauging perceived exertion?"" Addressing this question will gain insight into a better delivery system for recommending physical intensity to older adults. Lastly, the design and comprehensive metabolic measurements being proposed will provide an unprecedented opportunity to validate accelerometers for estimating the type and intensity of physical activity. Using new mathematical techniques that apply machine learning approaches (random forests, support vector and multiple kernel learning techniques), we will assess the potential to reduce the error in estimating the type and intensity of physical activity as compared to traditional methods. There are many end products of this research. First, the work will produce the largest dataset of metabolic cost for daily activities in 60+ years old. Second, an age-correction factor for metabolic costs will be created to apply to hundreds of tasks that fall into similar categories as those being evaluated.

"Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Richard D. Boyce, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has training in informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research as well as a strong commitment to improving medication safety for older adults. His prior work has focused on artificial intelligence methods for predicting drug-drug interactions and the comparative safety of  antidepressants for treating de- pressed nursing home residents. The current proposal is for a three year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that will address gaps in his knowledge of aging research and the nursing home setting. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Charles Reynolds, Jordan Karp, and Steven Handler) he has developed a training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on how to effectively translate research results from pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research to informatics interventions that improve medication safety for older adults, especially nursing home residents. To accomplish this goal, he proposes eight career development activities and two research aims that will help him 1) obtain rigorous training in the science and practice of creating clinical decision support interventions that are effective in the nursing home setting; 2) obtain a thorough understanding of how falls and fall risk factors are detected, monitored, reported, and assessed in the nursing home setting; and 3) learn the perceptions of multiple nursing home clinician stakeholders on what research is needed to help reduce medication-related adverse events. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by exploring the feasibility and potential clinical usefulness of actively monitoring patients exposed to psycho- tropic PDDIs. The approach would use electronic data available in most United States (US) NHs to provide highly specific and actionable alerts to physicians and/or nurses when a resident who is exposed to a PDDI involving a psychotropic drug transitions to a state of unacceptably high risk for experiencing a fall. Dr. Boyce's hypothesis is that this approach will extend the ability of NH clinicians to perform the recommended ""diligent monitoring"" of PDDIs, while avoiding alert fatigue. He anticipates that the approach would be generalizable to other prevalent NH ADEs (e.g., delirium) and other drug classes (e.g., mood stabilizers). This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore an innovative approach to managing PDDIs that may ultimately re- duce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). It wil also inform an R-series grant proposal to study a mature intervention that Dr. Boyce plans to submit in year 2 of the project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will impact public health by providing quantitative and qualitative pilot data that will inform the design of an intervention that should ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). The work will also provide a solid research basis for future active monitoring interventios targeting a broader set of PDDIs and other adverse events (e.g., delirium) prevalent in the NH setting.",Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr,8634379,K01AG044433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Detection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Group Interviews', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness research', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'hypnotic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'professor', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'sedative', 'therapy design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2014,114449,0.015330174827501323
"A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of adults age ≥ 65 years have high blood pressure (BP), but optimal management of high BP in the elderly remains controversial. Contrary to evidence in middle age that lowering BP is clearly beneficial, data in older adults are inconsistent and high BP may not be a risk factor in all elders. We recently reported that, among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey age e65 years, high BP was a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death only among persons in better health status (defined as fast walking of a 20-ft walk test). In contrast, high BP was not a risk factor among slow walkers. Additionally, the benefit of lowering BP in all elders remains an issue of debate; a recent meta-analysis in persons age 80 years and older reported no benefit of BP treatment on mortality, and significant heterogeneity across trials. Finally, there is growin concern for potential harms associated with treatment to lower BP. Excessive lowering of BP, particularly diastolic, has been associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in some studies. In the proposed research, we propose a novel paradigm where the associations of BP with adverse outcomes in older persons are considered in the setting of the complex aging process. Our long-term goal is to reliably identify elderly persons in whom BP treatment is beneficial and those in whom treatment is ineffective or even harmful, by defining subpopulations of similar health status. Specifically, aim 1 proposes to elucidate factors from four domains (functional, cognitive/mental, self-rated health, and physiologic) that can identify elderly persons in whom high systolic BP is strongly associated with higher risk for death and CV events, and those in whom it is not, using data from three NIH-funded cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) and Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA). In aim 2, we will evaluate the role of diastolic BP across level of health status. Finally, based on findings from these observational cohorts, in aim 3 we will evaluate whether these factors can identify elderly persons in whom treatment to lower BP is of maximum benefit in two randomized controlled trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SHEP) and the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3). Since participants in trials are healthier than the U.S. population, we will also evaluate the effect of treatment in the observational studies, using state-of-the-art causal inference methods, which can correct for the bias of standard analytic approaches. Completion of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the importance of high BP in older adults; will improve our ability to identify elderly persons who will benefit from BP treatment; will allow a systematic understanding of groups in whom evidence for BP treatment is lacking; and will guide design of future trials of hypertension in elderly adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Treatment of high blood pressure in elderly persons remains controversial. This proposal focuses on developing systematic methods to understand which elderly persons benefit from lowering blood pressure.

"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar. The outcome of this work will result in automated health assessments that make use of smart technology, recommendations for improving the ecological validity of office-based clinical assessments, automated real-time intervention methods that can help support preventative health care measures, and clinically-relevant, user-friendly interfaces for integration of smart home data into health records.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smar home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to gather validated activity and health related information that can be used by the medical community to improve the efficacy of traditional assessment and support ecological momentary intervention techniques. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.                ",Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance,8794633,R01EB009675,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Software Design', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'computer science', 'coping', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology development', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,334654,0.059964002513255704
"Molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The circadian clock regulates physiology and behavior and impinges on many aspects of our daily life. Nowhere is this more obvious than control of the sleep wake cycle, where clock genes have been shown to play a role in both the timing of sleep and its quality. For example, mutations in PER2 cause familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS), while mutations in  CSNK1E and CSNK1D cause FASPS and delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS),  respectively. However, while we have learned much about the clock and how it regulates sleep, the picture is incomplete. Behavioral studies in mice and studies in human cells show that dozens to hundreds of loci impact circadian clock function. However, only a dozen genes have been investigated for their roles in regulating behavior. Testing dozens to hundreds of mice isn't practical, so a new approach is needed. Here we seek to address this gap with a novel strategy that uses, i) integrative bioinformatics to prioritize putative core clock factors, ii) new experimental methods to determine whether they interact with known clock genes and regulate clock function in several cellular or tissue slice models, and, finally, iii) for a subset of promising candidates, generate mouse models and test them for their roles in regulating circadian behavior and sleep. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans.             Our internal biological clocks control many important aspects of our physiology and behavior such as the sleep-wake cycle. Genetics and large-scale genomic studies have implicated the role of a dozen canonical and hundreds of additional new genes in the circadian clock.  However, almost none of the new genes have been studied in animal models for their ability to regulate sleep onset or quality. We will address this gap using bioinformatics, experimental biology, and finally through behavioral analysis. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans.

"Chronic Conditions and Mutuality of Care in Late Life Marriage:A Multi-method App     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% experience functional disability. Thus, married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditios and disability of their own but also their spouse's. Understanding how support dynamics in marriage influence each partner's health will provide great insight into helping couples stay healthier and functionally independent into late life. The aim of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA) is to train the candidate in epidemiology of aging and advanced dyadic data analysis techniques to build on her expertise in experimental research and to understand how mutual care in late-life marriage influence health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression, and longevity. The proposed research focuses on older couples in which both partners suffer from chronic conditions and disability, and drawing from communal relationships theory, mutual care is defined as both partners receiving high levels of balanced instrumental and emotional support from one another. Through this MRSDA, the candidate will (1) learn from expert mentors and consultants about the epidemiology of aging and advanced statistical techniques to analyze dyadic, longitudinal data, (2) conduct secondary analysis on a large epidemiologic dyadic data set to examine how mutual care in older adult marriages influences long-term health and longevity and an experiment to examine a proposed mechanism, cardiovascular stress recovery, (3) complete coursework in epidemiology of aging, advanced epidemiologic statistics, and research ethics, and (4) attend workshops on dyadic data analysis. Yale University is a phenomenal environment to pursue this training as it has extensive resources in epidemiology of aging, statistics for analyzing epidemiologic data, experimental relationships research, and cardiovascular psychophysiology. The candidate has a state-of-the- art observational and psychophysiology lab that she will utilize for this project. Th Yale School of Public Health and the Claude D. Pepper Older American's Independence Center at Yale have excellent junior faculty mentoring programs. The candidate's primary mentor, Dr. Becca Levy at Yale School of Public Health has extensive expertise in bridging experimental and epidemiological methods to study psychosocial factors and health in older adults, including dyads. Dr. Richard Schulz will serve as a co-mentor, as he is the primary investigator for the Cardiovascular Health Effects Study which will be used for Study 1 of the proposed research and is an expert in conducting large, longitudinal studies. Dr. Trace Kershaw, an expert in dyadic data analysis at Yale School of Public Health, will also be a co-mentor. The proposed training will occur in the context of (1) a longitudinal study of married couples in which both members of the couple have chronic conditions and disability (Study 1; The Caregiver Health Effects Study; n=819 couples; an ancillary study to the Cardiovascular Health Study) examining the influence of mutual support on health trajectories (e.g. clinical and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease, clinical depression, and self-reported health) and longevity, and (2) an experimental study (Study 2; n=100 couples) examining cardiovascular stress recovery, a proposed mechanism for the link between mutual care and cardiovascular health proposed in Study 1. In the experimental study each partner will discuss a health-related stressor, and mutual support will be manipulated and compared to a control and one-sided support conditions to examine the effects on cardiovascular stress recovery. Consistent with the priorities outlined by the National Institute on Aging, the proposed MRSDA has the potential to address mechanisms for links between interpersonal relationships and health in the context of aging (RFA: PA-11-128). Further, the combination of training and research will serve as a spring board for the candidate's independent research career to elucidate how interpersonal relationships influence health among older adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% are functionally disabled.

"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,8617361,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2014,2047726,0.04738251163711153
"Smart Environment Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Americans unable to live independently in their homes due to cognitive or physical impairments is rising significantly due to the aging of the population. There is a currently a fundamental gap in the knowledge base concerning how to apply machine learning technologies to improve health monitoring and how to harness these technologies to implement interventions designed to sustain independent living. The long-term objective of this work is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this particular application is to design, implement, and evaluate technologies for assessing everyday functional limitations and for providing automated intervention strategies for persons with early-stage dementia. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. The central hypothesis is that many older adults with cognitive impairment can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Guided by strong preliminary data and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Design software algorithms that use smart environment data to recognize complex everyday activities in real-world settings, (2) Use smart environments to automate functional health assessment and to examine the ecological validity of laboratory-based measures, (3) Design automated reminder and prompting-based interventions to aid with everyday activity completion, and (4) Analyze correlations between everyday behavioral patterns and physiological data. The proposed work is innovative because it defines methods of detecting and coping with aging, early dementia and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. The proposed work is significant because it provides the basis for automated, robust functional assessment of individuals with cognitive limitations and of intervention strategies designed to improve functional independence for these individuals. Rather than relying on self-reporting by the patient or by an informant who may or may not spend extended time with the patient, smart home technologies will allow us to identify functional deficits that impede a patient's ability to maintain independence in their home as they begin to occur, and to extend independent living at home by intervening in a real world setting.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment. The result of this research will be software algorithms embedded in everyday environments that provide more reliable and accessible tools for measuring functional limitations, and that lay the foundation for creating and assessing tools that sustain or improve the ability to accomplish everyday tasks of living. Once such technologies become available, there is the likelihood that they can provide an ecologically valid method for monitoring an individual's everyday functional status and for extending the amount of time individuals can live independently in their own homes through the use of automated and reminder-based intervention.

"Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans spend over 90% of their activity related energy expenditure performing common daily activities. Health care professionals use normative data as a guide to prescribe appropriate activities for patients and clients. Additionally, scientists use this resource to plan physical activity or nutritional interventions ad apply these estimates to epidemiological research. However, while normative data have existed for over 20 years and are seemingly accurate in young adults, they can lead to misguided estimates of the metabolic cost of daily activities in older adults. This is not a trivial issue sice physical activity is one of the only known modalities to improve physical function in older adults and plays a critical role in regulating body weight. However, there is a serious lack of information pertaining to potential age-related differences in the metabolic cost of daily activitis. This leaves a major gap in knowledge for properly prescribing physical activity for a population that has elevated risk cardiopulmonary and orthopedic impairments. The primary goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that aging is associated with a difference in the metabolic cost f doing exercise and lifestyle activities. We will assess pulmonary gas exchange in 210 adults aged 20 to 80+ years with a portable indirect calorimeter worn while performing 38 daily activities. We will examine the metabolic equivalent (MET as a function of 3.5 milliliter"" min-1""kg-1), metabolic economy (energy expended for a given work rate) and relative metabolic cost (as a function of resting and peak oxygen consumption) for each task as a function of age. Secondly, we will address how metabolic costs of daily activities are affected by having functional impairments by testing an additional 90 older adults (60+ years) with functional impairment. Thirdly, because scientists and public health officials alike rely on perception-based exertion to monitor intensity of physical activity, we will address the question- ""Is aging associated with inaccuracies for self-gauging perceived exertion?"" Addressing this question will gain insight into a better delivery system for recommending physical intensity to older adults. Lastly, the design and comprehensive metabolic measurements being proposed will provide an unprecedented opportunity to validate accelerometers for estimating the type and intensity of physical activity. Using new mathematical techniques that apply machine learning approaches (random forests, support vector and multiple kernel learning techniques), we will assess the potential to reduce the error in estimating the type and intensity of physical activity as compared to traditional methods. There are many end products of this research. First, the work will produce the largest dataset of metabolic cost for daily activities in 60+ years old. Second, an age-correction factor for metabolic costs will be created to apply to hundreds of tasks that fall into similar categories as those being evaluated. Finally, the work will refine the tools needed to feasibly assess physical activity in young and old adults. These accomplishments will directly impact the fields of epidemiology, geriatric medicine, rehabilitation, and nutritional sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will advance the understanding the differences in the metabolic costs of daily activities due to old age and functional impairment. This is highly relevant to NIH's mission of promoting health by reducing the burdens of physical disability in old age.                ",Metabolic Costs of Daily Activities in Older Adults,8504141,R01AG042525,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Americas', 'Ankle', 'Beds', 'Body Weight', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Orthopedics', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Gas Exchange', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'falls', 'fitness', 'forest', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'insight', 'middle age', 'milliliter', 'nutrition', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2013,332841,0.018678386707385905
"Molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The circadian clock regulates physiology and behavior and impinges on many aspects of our daily life. Nowhere is this more obvious than control of the sleep wake cycle, where clock genes have been shown to play a role in both the timing of sleep and its quality. For example, mutations in PER2 cause familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS), while mutations in  CSNK1E and CSNK1D cause FASPS and delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS),  respectively. However, while we have learned much about the clock and how it regulates sleep, the picture is incomplete. Behavioral studies in mice and studies in human cells show that dozens to hundreds of loci impact circadian clock function. However, only a dozen genes have been investigated for their roles in regulating behavior. Testing dozens to hundreds of mice isn't practical, so a new approach is needed. Here we seek to address this gap with a novel strategy that uses, i) integrative bioinformatics to prioritize putative core clock factors, ii) new experimental methods to determine whether they interact with known clock genes and regulate clock function in several cellular or tissue slice models, and, finally, iii) for a subset of promising candidates, generate mouse models and test them for their roles in regulating circadian behavior and sleep. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans.             Our internal biological clocks control many important aspects of our physiology and behavior such as the sleep-wake cycle. Genetics and large-scale genomic studies have implicated the role of a dozen canonical and hundreds of additional new genes in the circadian clock.  However, almost none of the new genes have been studied in animal models for their ability to regulate sleep onset or quality. We will address this gap using bioinformatics, experimental biology, and finally through behavioral analysis. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans.

"Chronic Conditions and Mutuality of Care in Late Life Marriage     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% experience functional disability. Thus, married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditios and disability of their own but also their spouse's. Understanding how support dynamics in marriage influence each partner's health will provide great insight into helping couples stay healthier and functionally independent into late life. The aim of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA) is to train the candidate in epidemiology of aging and advanced dyadic data analysis techniques to build on her expertise in experimental research and to understand how mutual care in late-life marriage influence health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression, and longevity. The proposed research focuses on older couples in which both partners suffer from chronic conditions and disability, and drawing from communal relationships theory, mutual care is defined as both partners receiving high levels of balanced instrumental and emotional support from one another. Through this MRSDA, the candidate will (1) learn from expert mentors and consultants about the epidemiology of aging and advanced statistical techniques to analyze dyadic, longitudinal data, (2) conduct secondary analysis on a large epidemiologic dyadic data set to examine how mutual care in older adult marriages influences long-term health and longevity and an experiment to examine a proposed mechanism, cardiovascular stress recovery, (3) complete coursework in epidemiology of aging, advanced epidemiologic statistics, and research ethics, and (4) attend workshops on dyadic data analysis. Yale University is a phenomenal environment to pursue this training as it has extensive resources in epidemiology of aging, statistics for analyzing epidemiologic data, experimental relationships research, and cardiovascular psychophysiology. The candidate has a state-of-the- art observational and psychophysiology lab that she will utilize for this project. Th Yale School of Public Health and the Claude D. Pepper Older American's Independence Center at Yale have excellent junior faculty mentoring programs. The candidate's primary mentor, Dr. Becca Levy at Yale School of Public Health has extensive expertise in bridging experimental and epidemiological methods to study psychosocial factors and health in older adults, including dyads. Dr. Richard Schulz will serve as a co-mentor, as he is the primary investigator for the Cardiovascular Health Effects Study which will be used for Study 1 of the proposed research and is an expert in conducting large, longitudinal studies. Dr. Trace Kershaw, an expert in dyadic data analysis at Yale School of Public Health, will also be a co-mentor. The proposed training will occur in the context of (1) a longitudinal study of married couples in which both members of the couple have chronic conditions and disability (Study 1; The Caregiver Health Effects Study; n=819 couples; an ancillary study to the Cardiovascular Health Study) examining the influence of mutual support on health trajectories (e.g. clinical and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease, clinical depression, and self-reported health) and longevity, and (2) an experimental study (Study 2; n=100 couples) examining cardiovascular stress recovery, a proposed mechanism for the link between mutual care and cardiovascular health proposed in Study 1. In the experimental study each partner will discuss a health-related stressor, and mutual support will be manipulated and compared to a control and one-sided support conditions to examine the effects on cardiovascular stress recovery. Consistent with the priorities outlined by the National Institute on Aging, the proposed MRSDA has the potential to address mechanisms for links between interpersonal relationships and health in the context of aging (RFA: PA-11-128). Further, the combination of training and research will serve as a spring board for the candidate's independent research career to elucidate how interpersonal relationships influence health among older adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% are functionally disabled.

"Smart Environment Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Americans unable to live independently in their homes due to cognitive or physical impairments is rising significantly due to the aging of the population. There is a currently a fundamental gap in the knowledge base concerning how to apply machine learning technologies to improve health monitoring and how to harness these technologies to implement interventions designed to sustain independent living. The long-term objective of this work is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this particular application is to design, implement, and evaluate technologies for assessing everyday functional limitations and for providing automated intervention strategies for persons with early-stage dementia. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. The central hypothesis is that many older adults with cognitive impairment can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Guided by strong preliminary data and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Design software algorithms that use smart environment data to recognize complex everyday activities in real-world settings, (2) Use smart environments to automate functional health assessment and to examine the ecological validity of laboratory-based measures, (3) Design automated reminder and prompting-based interventions to aid with everyday activity completion, and (4) Analyze correlations between everyday behavioral patterns and physiological data.

"Predicting Care Coordination Needs of Frail Older Adults from Longitudinal Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current health care system fails to meet the needs of most chronically ill older adults. Given that the chronically ill are the major consumers of health care dollars, development of systems that provide support in the management of the complex health care needs is critical. Care coordination is one intervention that is recognized as a mechanism to support chronically ill persons in managing their health care. However, care coordination has multiple definitions, models, providers, and settings. Most care coordination programs have been focused on specific time periods such as transition between care settings. Further, there is limited evidence about the key components of care coordination, making the content of care coordination virtually a ""black box"" although payment for care coordination is included in current health care legislation. Accordingly, the purpose of this proposed study is to examine the type and amount of nurse care coordination interventions and the relationship of these interventions to both patient characteristics and outcomes. To be specific, this study aims to  "" identify interventions used in nurse care coordination for frail older community dwelling adults;  "" identify the relationships among patient characteristics, components of nurse care coordination  intervention, and patient outcomes; and  "" develop and validate models predicting patient outcomes for frail older community dwelling adults who  received nurse care coordination interventions. This proposed study employs a secondary analysis that will examine existing datasets derived from a recent randomized controlled trial that tested the effectiveness of a home care medication management program (HCMM) for frail older adults. The datasets examined will include electronic patient records and communication logs documented through the CareFacts(R) system, HCMM Access database, and Medicare claims data. Due to the complexity of datasets with structured data and unstructured narrative text data, both natural language processing and statistical analyses will be employed according to the purpose of the study. This project is innovative in that it explores nurse care coordination interventions that followed patients across multiple settings with the focus on management of their chronic illness care in their day to day life over a one year period in the home setting. The results of this study will add new insight to the relationships among specific patient characteristics, care coordination interventions, and patient outcomes. This new knowledge will assist decision-making of clinicians, health administrators, and policy makers with respect to health care quality, resource utilization, cost reduction, and reimbursement policy. Also, the resulting predictive model will assist in clinical information system design to support clinicians' decision-making.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed study will use existing data to examine the type and amount of nurse care coordination interventions provided to frail older community dwelling adults. The results of this study will add new insight to the relationships among specific patient characteristics, nurse care coordination interventions, and patient outcomes.

"Care coordination for older adults: Process, outcomes, cost    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent research provides evidence that care coordination improves outcomes such as hospitalization, rehospitalization, emergency room use, and reduces cost. One program using nurse care coordination as an intervention to improve care for community dwelling older adults' was Aging in Place (AIP) at the University of Missouri's Sinclair School of Nursing. AIP's service provider for the enhanced nurse care coordination intervention was Senior Care, a home health agency and Home and Community Based service provider. After the AIP study ended Senior Care continued to exist as a home health care (HHC) agency. Taking advantage of the unique data from the AIP study, and the HHC agency we propose to perform a secondary analysis to (1) identify care coordination interventions, intervention activities, and intervention doses used by AIP nurse care coordinators using enhanced nurse coordination, and HHC nurses providing traditional HHC , (2) describe any differences in interventions used by AIP nurse care coordinators, and HHC nurses, and finally (3) to identify whether outcomes of hospitalization, rehospitalization, emergency room use, and cost differ for older adults in the AIP and HHC groups. The original AIP analysis did not link specific nurse care coordination interventions with outcomes, identify the specific activities associated with interventions, explore intervention dose, or compare outcomes to traditional HHC. Data will compare two groups of older people who received services, those with enhanced nurse care coordination in the AIP group from the years 2000-2002 and those who received traditional HHC without enhanced nurse care coordination from the years 2003-2005. Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods will be used to identify interventions and activities nurse care coordinators used when coordinating care for older adults. NLP transforms human-generated text into machine-readable (structured) information. We propose to use a unique iterative approach to NLP in which the available activities are extracted from existing electronic medical records from Senior Care, while new activities are identified by hand from records in which not enough information was found in the first pass. After each pass, a team of experts will check the extracted activities to assure that they are relevant to care coordination. Intervention profiles that are representative for AIP and HHC will be developed by determining what types of activities occur most frequently for each intervention category and target, and which ones are most representative of the category and target. Dose profiles of interventions will be developed, and finally, outcomes of hospitalization, rehospitalization, emergency room use, and cost will be compared between the AIP and HHC groups.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study informs research and clinical practice by identifying actual care coordination intervention activities and dose, and developing intervention profiles for future use in research and practice. The Natural Language Processing method will add to our knowledge of how to successful use electronic medical record text data.              This study informs research and clinical practice by identifying actual care coordination intervention activities and dose, and developing intervention profiles for future use in research and practice.

"Predicting Care Coordination Needs of Frail Older Adults from Longitudinal Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current health care system fails to meet the needs of most chronically ill older adults. Given that the chronically ill are the major consumers of health care dollars, development of systems that provide support in the management of the complex health care needs is critical. Care coordination is one intervention that is recognized as a mechanism to support chronically ill persons in managing their health care. However, care coordination has multiple definitions, models, providers, and settings. Most care coordination programs have been focused on specific time periods such as transition between care settings. Further, there is limited evidence about the key components of care coordination, making the content of care coordination virtually a ""black box"" although payment for care coordination is included in current health care legislation. Accordingly, the purpose of this proposed study is to examine the type and amount of nurse care coordination interventions and the relationship of these interventions to both patient characteristics and outcomes. To be specific, this study aims to  "" identify interventions used in nurse care coordination for frail older community dwelling adults;  "" identify the relationships among patient characteristics, components of nurse care coordination  intervention, and patient outcomes; and  "" develop and validate models predicting patient outcomes for frail older community dwelling adults who  received nurse care coordination interventions. This proposed study employs a secondary analysis that will examine existing datasets derived from a recent randomized controlled trial that tested the effectiveness of a home care medication management program (HCMM) for frail older adults. The datasets examined will include electronic patient records and communication logs documented through the CareFacts(R) system, HCMM Access database, and Medicare claims data. Due to the complexity of datasets with structured data and unstructured narrative text data, both natural language processing and statistical analyses will be employed according to the purpose of the study. This project is innovative in that it explores nurse care coordination interventions that followed patients across multiple settings with the focus on management of their chronic illness care in their day to day life over a one year period in the home setting. The results of this study will add new insight to the relationships among specific patient characteristics, care coordination interventions, and patient outcomes. This new knowledge will assist decision-making of clinicians, health administrators, and policy makers with respect to health care quality, resource utilization, cost reduction, and reimbursement policy. Also, the resulting predictive model will assist in clinical information system design to support clinicians' decision-making.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed study will use existing data to examine the type and amount of nurse care coordination interventions provided to frail older community dwelling adults.

"Variable prompting technology for improving the ADL task performance of older adu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The older adult population (65+) is the fastest growing segment of the American population and is expected to grow from 12% to 21% of the US population over the next 20 years 1. As people live longer, the prevalence of debilitating, diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia will also increase. The cognitive decline associated with dementia often leads to impaired functioning with activities of daily living (ADL) with a resultant increased burden for health and social support services currently approaches $100 billion annually in the United States.1 Attempts to minimize the demand for human support services have resulted in research investigating the use of assistive technology to support independence. These systems generally incorporate sensors and/or video surveillance techniques to remotely monitor the health and behavior of seniors. However, this population is still underserved by existing technology's ability to detect the required amount of prompting needed and provide coaching on activities of daily living in a respectful, non-invasive manner. Consistent with NIA's mission and research priorities, CreateAbility Concepts, Inc.'s (CCI) will produce the SMART (Sensor Monitoring and Acuity Recognition Technology) prompt system. The hypothesis for Phase I is that variable prompting technology can successfully aid in the completion of tasks associated with ADLs for individuals with cognitive impairments. The Specific Aims CCI will use to test this hypothesis are: 1): Design and develop the computer vision and integrate and test the prototype subsystems to support the pilot study, and 2) Using a pilot study, determine whether variable prompting will improve the functional task performance for older adults with dementia. At the conclusion of Phase I, CCI will have data from a pilot study with 60 participants to support the premise that older adults with dementia can independently complete tasks of varying complexities when a human administrator assesses their need based on the participant's task performance and supplies the correct level of detail to the participant. Market acceptance is expected to be high due to the pent up demand and cost- effective offering.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this SBIR project, CreateAbility Concepts, Inc. will develop technology to support and improve quality of life, well-being, and the ability of older adults to live independently and safely at home. SMART-prompt will detect and monitor an individual's task performance throughout the day and deliver person-centered prompting instructions to complete activities of daily living.            In this SBIR project, CreateAbility Concepts, Inc. will develop technology to support and improve quality of life, well-being, and the ability of older adults to live independently and safely at home.

"Prediction of Physiological Events in People with Sleep Disordered Breathing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) refers to a spectrum of disorders characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns or levels of ventilation during sleep. The most common is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). People with OSA experience repetitive apnea (cessation of breathing) and hypopnea (marked decrease in tidal volume) during sleep in association with airway compromise and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). An arousal, or brief, often unnoticed, disruption of sleep is commonly associated with apnea. People with OSA also exhibit cognitive dysfunction, including impairment to memory, attention, and executive function. OSA- associated EDS and cognitive dysfunction are thought to significantly contribute to automobile accidents and workplace injuries. The first aim of this research is to predict the onset of nocturnal apnea, hypopnea, and arousal. Our proposal to accomplish this aim represents an entirely new approach to improving the effectiveness and tolerability of SBD therapy. The most common therapy is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which is difficult for many patients to tolerate. Existing auto-adjusting PAP may be more tolerable but relies on detection of disordered breathing events and does not appear to improve quality of life compared with conventional CPAP. Predicting these events could lead to more effective titration of PAP levels and improved outcomes. Other therapies, such as the electrical stimulation of various cranial nerves or pharyngeal muscles, could also be improved by predicting disordered breathing. The second aim is to predict the onset of unintended daytime sleep while subjects undergo maintenance of wakefulness tests, which assess one's ability to resist sleep in a soporific condition. The third aim is to predict performance lapses during driving simulations. Accomplishing aims two and three could lead to the development of warning devices for at-risk individuals. Our novel prediction algorithms track the interactions between several physiological systems and reveal the most important predictors. The fourth aim is to contrast the key predictors between OSA, acutely sleep-deprived, and control subjects, and between men and women. By doing so, we expect to gain insight into the underlying pathophysiology of SDB and EDS, and will investigate sex differences in OSA and sleep deprivation. OSA is a major public health problem whose effects on society are comparable to those of smoking. The capability to predict its adverse consequences will be an invaluable tool to improve the quality of life of people with SDB, reduce the associated costs, and improve public health          n/a",Prediction of Physiological Events in People with Sleep Disordered Breathing,8133670,F30HL097403,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Apnea', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breathing', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronics', 'Environmental air flow', 'Event', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Illinois', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Smoking', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Titrations', 'Universities', 'Wakefulness', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'Zebra', 'adverse outcome', 'automobile accident', 'cost', 'design', 'executive function', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pharynx muscle', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'sleep onset', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2011,42919,0.04791672762305955
"Smart Environment Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Americans unable to live independently in their homes due to cognitive or physical impairments is rising significantly due to the aging of the population. There is a currently a fundamental gap in the knowledge base concerning how to apply machine learning technologies to improve health monitoring and how to harness these technologies to implement interventions designed to sustain independent living. The long-term objective of this work is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this particular application is to design, implement, and evaluate technologies for assessing everyday functional limitations and for providing automated intervention strategies for persons with early-stage dementia. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. The central hypothesis is that many older adults with cognitive impairment can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society.

The capability to predict its adverse consequences will be an invaluable tool to improve the quality of life of people with SDB, reduce the associated costs, and improve public health          n/a",Prediction of Physiological Events in People with Sleep Disordered Breathing,7745752,F30HL097403,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Apnea', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breathing', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronics', 'Environmental air flow', 'Event', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Illinois', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Smoking', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Titrations', 'Universities', 'Wakefulness', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'Zebra', 'automobile accident', 'cost', 'design', 'executive function', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pharynx muscle', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'sleep onset', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2009,42295,0.04791672762305955
"HIV Risk Behavior in out-of school rural Af. Am. Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent epidemiological evidence indicates that the risk of contracting HIV is increasing among African American young adults living in the rural South. African American communities in rural Georgia are characterized by chronic unemployment and poverty along with a dearth of health and educational resources. Young adults in these communities face significant barriers to adequate employment and higher education. Many respond to this lack of opportunity and the resulting economic pressure by engaging in high-risk behavior, including substance use and unprotected sexual activity. Although young adults attending higher education have been studied extensively, barriers to obtaining valid samples have prevented empirical research on the risk and protective factors that affect rural African American young adults who do not attend college. The research proposed in this R-21 application addresses the public health need to develop new approaches to obtaining valid samples of hard-to-reach members of populations at risk for HIV and substance use and to identify the protective factors that dissuade them from engaging in high risk behaviors. The objectives of this study are to (1) test the feasibility of Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) for obtaining a sample of rural African American young adults age 18-21 who are out of school and living in resource- poor, rural environments, and (2) evaluate a model of the personal, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors that explain high-risk sexual behavior among these young people. RDS is a novel technique that combines ""snowball sampling"" with a mathematical model that weights the sample to compensate for its non-random nature. RDS will be used to obtain a sample of 240 rural African American young adults. Data will be gathered to evaluate a heuristic model that includes the following predictors: socioeconomic and personal stressors; the negative emotions these stressors induce; support and socialization from prosocial adults; intrapersonal protective processes, including a future orientation, self-regulation, emotion regulation, and racial identity; affiliations with risk-taking peers and sexual partners; and antecedents of HIV-related risk behavior, such as behavioral intentions and attitudes toward sexually protective behaviors.           n/a",HIV Risk Behavior in out-of school rural Af.

"Novel Real-Time Algorithms:Quantifying Wake-Sleep States The overall goal of this project is to develop and clinically validate a novel class of computerized EEG-based algorithms and sophisticated signal processing methods designed for high temporal resolution characterization of the wake-sleep transition and fluctuations within sleep stages. In addition to their capability of profiling wakefulness and various sleep stages as a continuous process, these algorithms will be developed in a format such that they can be eventually implemented for real-time detection of wake-to sleep transitions. The new approach of this proposal is based on an innovative interaction of classically independent signal processing methods for quantifying EEG, including traditional Short-Term Fourier Transform, Recursive Auto-regressive Parameter Estimation, and Wavelet analysis. This new approach takes advantage of each method's relative strength and ""fuses"" the information obtained from each technique to provide a means of quantifying the entire wake-sleep transition with high temporal resolution (e.g., early detection of sleep onset) while being robust to factors that normally degrade EEG processing. The developed algorithms will be validated with an extensive set of clinical data including nocturnal polysomnography, and day-time tests of Sleepiness, MSLT (Multiple Sleep Latency Test) and MWT (Maintenance of Wakefulness Test). The dynamic events detected by these algorithms (e.g., micro-arousals and micro-sleeps) will be evaluated against standard R&K scoring of the same EEG data. Furthermore, the profile and characteristics of the events detected in PSG will be correlated with the daytime objective and subjective tests of sleepiness. n/a",Novel Real-Time Algorithms:Quantifying Wake-Sleep States,6838292,R43HL078442,"['arousal', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'electroencephalography', 'human subject', 'mathematics', 'polysomnography', 'sleep', 'wakefulness']",NHLBI,"CLEVELAND MEDICAL DEVICES, INC.",R43,2004,176785,0.00974155379076757
"Cognitive and social aspects of decision-making  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of decision making in older adults is critical for both theoretical and practical reasons. Despite the importance of this topic, there is limited empirical data describing how decision making changes in adulthood. The proposed project will examine the basic processes that underlie decision-making in older adults. A review of the literature suggests that older adults should rely more on heuristics and be more susceptible to environmental triggers than younger adults. However, a direct examination of the impact on decision-making has not been done. Specifically, we will examine the availability and anchoring heuristics in younger and older adults using modified versions of the traditional tasks designed by Tversky and Kahneman (1973, 1974). Finally, we will examine the impact of a negative stereotype trigger on the use of heuristics in older and younger adults. A total of 6 experiments are proposed over a three-year period. Experiment 1 examines the availability heuristic in young and older adults across several conditions that manipulate the amount of material presented. Experiment 2 examines the availability heuristic in older and young adults across two conditions that manipulate speed of presentation. It is hypothesized that older adults will demonstrate an increase in the availability heuristic on conditions with a large amount of material and with speeded presentation. Experiment 3 and 4 will examine the anchoring bias in two experiments that present an anchor randomly and with a decision agent present, respectively. We hypothesize an increase in the anchoring bias and more reliance on decision agents. Experiment 5 and 6 will introduce a negative stereotype trigger prior to the administration of an availability heuristic task and anchoring task. We hypothesize that the addition of a trigger will result in an increased bias across tasks and conditions as older adults switch from an analytic to rule-based mode.   n/a",Cognitive and social aspects of decision-making,6556001,R15AG021442,"['age difference', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' bias', ' clinical research', ' cognition', ' decision making', ' human old age (65+)', ' human subject', ' prejudice', ' questionnaires', ' university student', ' young adult human (21-34)']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT COLORADO SPGS,R15,2002,137500,0.11122420548559275

"SCH: INT: VOLI: Voice Assistant for Quality of Life and Healthcare Improvement in Aging Populations   According to the latest US Census Bureau predictions, by 2035 older people are projected to outnumber children for the first time in US history. This brings significant societal challenges based on their unique living and health-related conditions stemming from reduced sensory, motor, and cognitive capabilities, as wen as multiple chronic conditions. We propose a personalized and context-aware voice-based digital assistant to improve the quality of life and the healthcare of older adults. VOLI will leverage the growing capabilities of existing technologies, such as mobile devices and smart speakers, and go well beyond the basics of weather reports, news services, and simple games, to provide more complex voice-based services and to focus on the healthcare domain with its many challenges and constraints. We will pursue three parallel research aims: 1) Our technical aim will investigate how digital assistants, natural language processing, and machine learning can produce meaningful health-related conversations by leveraging population- and patient-level data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs); 2) Our social, behavioral, and cognitive aim will focus on designing services for older adults based on their needs to support independence and investigate the acceptability of digital assistants for the aging population; and 3) Our clinical aim will investigate how digital assistants can detect new symptoms and correlate them with medication side effects and interactions, worsening of existing conditions, or onset of new illnesses. Using our VOLI voice-assistant, older adults will be able to get medication reminders and instructions based on prescriptions and clinical notes from EHRs, notify their family/caregiver about their well-being status, interact with their healthcare provider, request an Uber/Lyft car or other third-party services, engage in cognitive games, report symptoms as they occur throughout the day and over the counter medications they are taking, ask questions about symptoms and medications, and so on. VOLi integrates information from EHRs, clinical ontologies, and patient-level terminology. This work will be supported by innovations in natural language understanding, deep learning, and human-computer interfaces. Our work is guided by both clinicians and researchers in human-centered computing. Our team has a history of successful interdisciplinary work in healthcare, expert systems in clinical care, EHR integration, patient monitoring and self-report, ubiquitous computing, data analytics, and field studies. This research directly supports the mission of NIA by addressing the needs of older adults to be independent in their homes and to optimize their healthcare based on the context of their symptoms and medications. VOLI will also reduce caregiving burden and optimize the interactions with healthcare and service providers. The research can be extended to monitor recovery after surgery and reduce length of stay in the hospital, identify onset of new illness, or Identify when to refer a patient to hospice.",SCH: INT: VOLI: Voice Assistant for Quality of Life and Healthcare Improvement in Aging Populations  ,10019457,R56AG067393,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data Analytics', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Expert Systems', 'Family Caregiver', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Instruction', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Time', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Voice', 'Weather', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'care giving burden', 'clinical care', 'deep learning', 'design', 'electronic data', 'field study', 'handheld mobile device', 'hospice environment', 'human centered computing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent personal assistant', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'news', 'postoperative recovery', 'service providers', 'side effect', 'social', 'stem', 'ubiquitous computing']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R56,2020,299370,0.04603794943712889
"Are phenotype algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults?- Revision Are phenotyping algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults? According to the latest population estimates by the US Census bureau, the United States population is growing older and more diverse, with their projections indicating that in 2035 there will be more people 65-and-older than 18-and-younger. In terms of diversity, the US Census Bureau projects that by 2060 the non-Hispanic White-alone population will shrink by 20 million, leading to the increased representation of currently underrepresented minority groups. These future population milestones paired with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) use in medicine, present a very unique and problematic problem: determining if AI solutions are fair for underrepresented populations within older adults. This has been a very debated issue, with opinion pieces in the New York times making it clear that when done incorrectly, AI solutions can actually worsen health disparities in underrepresented populations due to the nature of the training sets for said AI solutions. It is intuitive to understand how dermatology AI systems could be biased to perform better for lighter skinned individuals, due to the prevalence of said patients in the training datasets. Other biases come from the fact that there is simply a lack of diverse research subjects, which is why their mortality outcomes are considerably worse. Electronic phenotyping algorithms are the cornerstone for automatic identification of selected patient groups for tasks like disease classification, epidemiological studies and clinical-trial recruitment. These algorithms are both rule-based or probabilistic in nature (machine learning models), and are usually built by using bundled patient populations (everybody put together), with very few exceptions (due to the nature of the phenotype) having some sort of stratification of populations. This proposed project seeks to identify bias in probabilistic electronic phenotype algorithms for older populations and create best-practices and software tools to overcome them in order to lead to better health outcomes. Are phenotyping algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults? We will determine racial and age bias in probabilistic phenotype algorithms in both local, and national datasets. After characterizing bias, we will develop best-practices and software tools to improve the phenotyping process to achieve fairness for underrepresented minorities.",Are phenotype algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults?- Revision,10049865,P30AG059307,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Censuses', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data Set', 'Dermatology', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Excision', 'Expert Systems', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research Subjects', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'base', 'disease classification', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic bias', 'ethnic diversity', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'population stratification', 'racial bias', 'recruit']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,P30,2020,50916,0.0744295191334345
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.

"Inflammatory and ADRD Biomarker Predictors of Perioperative Digital Clock Drawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.

"Understanding and Predicting High-Need, High-Cost Patients among Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This is a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award submitted to the National Institute on Aging by Yongkang Zhang, a Research Associate in the Department of Healthcare Policy and Research at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC). Dr. Zhang’s career goal is to become an independent researcher on improving care for the elderly through developing and applying effective prediction tools to identify older adults with complex conditions and high healthcare needs. This K99/R00 application will provide Dr. Zhang with the necessary training 1) to understand the complexity and characteristics of high-need, high-cost (HNHC) older adults; 2) to develop a prediction model for HNHC adults using machine learning methods; and 3) to test the performance of the machine learning-based model with three commonly used, patient-risk prediction tools.  Dr. Zhang has assembled a mentor team of accomplished researchers across multiple divisions and departments at Weill Cornell Medical College: Dr. Rainu Kaushal (primary mentor) who is the Nanette Laitman Distinguished Professor and an expert on the HNHC patients and health data science; Dr. Lawrence Casalino (co-mentor) who is the Livingston Farrand Professor of Public Health and an expert on characteristics of and healthcare delivery for HNHC patients; Dr. Mark Lachs (co-mentor) who is a Professor of Geriatrics and prac- ticing geriatrician and an expert on the complexity and healthcare needs of older adults; Dr. Yuhua Bao (co- mentor) who is an Associate Professor of Healthcare Policy and Research and expert on behavioral health conditions and prescription data; Dr. Fei Wang (co-mentor) who is an Associate Professor of Health Informat- ics and an expert on machine learning methods; and Dr. James Flory (consultant) who is an Assistant Profes- sor of Healthcare Policy and Research and practicing clinician and an expert on medication use.  HNHC older adults are small group of patients representing a disproportionate share of healthcare utili- zation. These patients are more likely to experience preventable quality and safety problems due to their fre- quent interactions with health systems. Caring for HNHC older adults provides great potential benefits for qual- ity improvement and cost reduction. However, the benefits are unlikely to be realized unless these patients can be correctly identified and targeted. Building on his previous research and training on developing a claims data-based taxonomy for HNHC Medicare patients, Dr. Zhang’s research will understand the characteristics of HNHC older adults and develop predictors for these patients using clinical and prescription data (Aim 1), de- velop a machine learning-based prediction model for HNHC older adults (Aim 2), and compare the perfor- mance of the prediction model with three commonly used, patient risk prediction tools (Aim 3). This research will be the foundation for an R01 grant application that will incorporate this prediction model into healthcare de- livery process and identify the optimal ways to inform opportunities for improvement in healthcare delivery. PROJECT NARRATIVE High-need, high-cost (HNHC) older adults are a small group of individuals representing a disproportionate share of healthcare utilization and experiencing preventable quality and safety problems. Improving care for HNHC older adults is challenging because of their complex medical, behavioral, and social conditions and the instability of their healthcare utilization. Developing a prediction model for HNHC older adults could better inform patient-centered clinical decision-making, help target quality improvement interventions, and prioritize the allocation of scarce healthcare resources.","Understanding and Predicting High-Need, High-Cost Patients among Older Adults",9977380,K99AG064030,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policy Research', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Conditions', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'career', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'distinguished professor', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'frailty', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'health care service organization', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'multilayer perceptron', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'performance tests', 'post-doctoral training', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'random forest', 'social', 'social vulnerability', 'tool']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K99,2020,125185,0.05754590531217274
"Innovative technologies for active surveillance of older adults with low-risk skin cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the number one cancer diagnosed in the US each year and accounts for more cases than all other cancers combined.1,2 Most BCCs are not dangerous, as they typically grow slowly and rarely metastasize or affect quality of life. Because cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is a major cause of these lesions, BCCs are considered a non-lethal disease of aging, with the vast majority occurring in people 65 years or older. Despite the low risk BCCs present to patients, in the US all lesions are usually treated. Though existing treatments are effective,3,4 post treatment complications are common; in one prospective cohort study 27% of patients reported a problem after a procedure.5 Moreover, over 100,000 BCCs are treated annually in persons who ultimately die within one year of unrelated causes.6 For patients near the end of life, who often manage multiple health issues, treating these lesions may expose them to the associated medical risks with little potential benefit.7  There is a pressing need to reduce over-treatment and instead develop safe and effective active surveillance methods for low risk BCC in older patients. This research aims to fundamentally change the current “one size fits all” standard of care for treatment of BCCs, which is particularly problematic for older adults.6,8,9 The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). We hypothesize that home-based active surveillance of low risk BCCs would reduce unnecessary procedures, complications and burdensome clinic visits in patients whose BCCs are not changing, while ensuring that patients whose BCCs grow or become symptomatic receive prompt care. For the first step of the proposed research, we will refine an existing artificial intelligence algorithm and mobile app to optimize it for at-home active surveillence use for older adults with low-risk BCC. We will then conduct pre-testing with a small group of patients and caregivers (n=15) to iteratively improve the app and ensure usability. Finally, we will compare the data collected via the app to that collected during routine clinical visits. Over a 9-month period, we will follow participants (n=30) with low-risk BCC who have selected an active surveillance option. We will collect data monthly through the app, and every 3 months through in-person clinic visits. We will evaluate patient satisfaction and clinical course to determine the feasibility of using a mobile app for active surveillance of low-risk BCC.

"Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis PROJECT SUMMARY  The opioid overdose crisis emerged in predominantly White communities, but the opioid-related mortality rate is increasing most rapidly in the Black population. A key driver of the crisis is opioid use disorder, which affects over 2 million Americans. Despite their effectiveness, medications for opioid use disorder remain underused, especially among Black Americans. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans have lower access to medications for opioid use disorder, are one-third as likely to initiate treatment, and have lower retention in care. Black Americans face unique structural obstacles to care, such as mistrust of the health care system, lack of representation among medical providers, and racially-biased providers’ perceptions. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the structural factors associated with treatment initiation and retention in care for Black patients with OUD. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify modifiable structural factors at the community, provider, and facility levels that affect treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder in the Black population. This innovative project proposes to leverage machine learning-based causal inference methods with a combination of large national electronic medical records, corporate data warehouses, and publicly available data. By combining multiple data sources, this project will empirically evaluate modifiable factors such as provider characteristics (e.g., years of experience, patient satisfaction scores), facility characteristics (e.g., mental health staffing to patient ratios, number of buprenorphine-eligible prescribers), and patient-provider characteristics (e.g., number of previous visits or interactions). While focused on promoting equitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder in Black Americans, the public health implications of this proposal are expected to apply broadly to ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders and reduce health disparities. This research plan is complemented by a career development plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics. Specifically, this career development plan outlines new training in three areas: (1) the clinical treatment of opioid use disorder, (2) analysis of the massive data of electronic medical records, and (3) machine learning-based causal inference methods. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career identifying, evaluating, and implementing multilevel interventions to reduce racial/ethnic inequalities in treatment for substance use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Opioid use disorder is a key driver of the U.S. opioid overdose crisis, yet treatment remains both underused and unequal. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying modifiable structural predictors of treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder. The results of this project are expected to inform multilevel interventions equitably deliver treatment for opioid use disorder, ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders, and reduce health disparities.",Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis,10039535,K99DA051534,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'African American', 'American', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caucasian American', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'forest', 'health administration', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'novel strategies', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'prescription opioid', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial disparity', 'skills', 'social', 'standard of care', 'success', 'treatment disparity']",NIDA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,179582,0.02086560879577599
"Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The opioid crisis is the deadliest drug epidemic in American history and new approaches are needed. One novel approach includes predicting likelihood of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment retention by assessing someone’s risk of early departure from treatment. Current methods to improve treatment retention rely on providers using their intuition to identify when an individual is at risk of leaving treatment early in order to intervene, which often happens too late. Mobile health and machine learning predictive analytics offer a new opportunity to personalize OUD treatment, improve retention in OUD care, and mitigate the risk of relapse and overdose episodes. Project Motivate will combine physiological and behavioral data from disparate sources in order to predict when an individual is at risk of early departure from OUD treatment. This data will be displayed in a user-friendly manner so that providers can more effectively support patients to remain in treatment with timely intervention and responses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early departure from opioid use disorder treatment programs is common, with early termination rates over 50% for many opioid use disorder treatments, putting individuals at an increased risk of relapsing, overdose and death. Using physiological monitoring tools to predict the likelihood that someone is at risk of early departure from opioid use disorder treatment due to worsening symptoms and/or cravings will allow for proactive interventions that will improve treatment retention. Making an impact here will not only save lives, but it will also lower medical costs, municipal emergency response costs, recidivism, workplace accidents, lost workplace productivity and costs to families.",Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder,10013066,R43DA051279,"['Accidents', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dropout', 'Early treatment', 'Emergency response', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Heroin', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Municipalities', 'Overdose', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prescription drug overdose', 'Productivity', 'Professional counselor', 'Program Development', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residential Treatment', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visualization software', 'Weather', 'Workplace', 'Wrist', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'craving', 'dashboard', 'data visualization', 'digital', 'early onset', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'motivational intervention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'patient engagement', 'personalized intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'recidivism', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'sensor', 'sleep quality', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies', 'wearable device']",NIDA,"BIOMOTIVATE, LLC",R43,2020,251492,0.020362423542824186
"Systems Immunology in Aging and Chronic Diseases of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The funds requested in this R13 application are for partial support of “Systems Immunology in Aging and Chronic Diseases of Aging” annual meetings to be offered each September from 2020 through 2022 at The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine (JAX-GM) in Farmington, Connecticut. This meeting builds on its very successful first instance in 2019 and will bring together up to 150 interdisciplinary scientists including molecular biologists, immunologists, computational biologists, and geriatricians, who share a common interest in understanding aging and aging-associated disease at the systems level. Many aging-associated diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, are influenced by dysfunctions in the immune system. Recent advances in genomic profiling techniques (e.g., single cell transcriptomics) provide an opportunity to uncover aging-related changes in human cells/tissues and to link these changes to health and lifespan. The wealth and complexity of data produced using these technologies is ever increasing, as is the need to develop advanced computational methods to mine and integrate these data. Despite this need, there are currently no formal venues at which scientists, specifically those in the aging field, can be trained in the basics and application of data mining techniques (i.e., machine learning algorithms). Furthermore, current conferences on aging are not aimed at specifically bringing together computational biologists, immunologists and basic and clinical aging researchers. Therefore, the objectives of this meeting are: (1) to recognize and emphasize the highly interdisciplinary nature of the aging field and to promote and accelerate collaborations and cross-pollination of ideas across the three disciplines: aging, immunology, and computational biology; (2) to provide trainees (students and postdoctoral fellows) an opportunity to closely interact with, and gain feedback from, more senior investigators to advance their projects and establish connections to help build their careers; and (3) to provide an opportunity for researchers in the field of aging to learn the basics of machine learning techniques, which they will be able to immediately apply to their own research upon return to their home institutions. We will reach these objectives through carrying out the following Aims. In Aim 1, we will organize an interdisciplinary meeting and hands-on workshop focused on aging and aging-related diseases. The meeting will include a 2-day seminar session featuring talks by leading scientists, followed by a 1-day hands-on workshop on the basics of machine learning. In Aim 2, we will promote interactions to foster collaborative research and career advancement, including through a poster session. In Aim 3, we will recruit diverse attendees. Our proposed speaker list features several female scientists, and we will use our partnership networks to specifically recruit attendees from nationally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. The ultimate goal of the meeting is to advance the aging research field through expediting collaborations and the understanding of aging-related genomic data via application of advanced data mining approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Aging and aging-associated diseases, such as Alzheimer's, cancer and cardiovascular disease, represent a significant and growing health and economic burden, with the elderly population of the US projected to double by 2030. Herein, we propose to organize an interdisciplinary conference with a hands-on computational training component that will bring together scientists from the fields of aging, immunology, and computational biology, which will enable creative collaborations and train early career scientists in the aging research field on the basics of advanced computational techniques to mine aging-related genomic data.

"electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS). ABSTRACT Recent meta-analyses have found that participation in the appropriate fall-prevention exercise program for an older adult reduces the risk of falls by 23% in relative terms, for an absolute reduction of 0.20 falls per person per year. Many guidelines, including the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), recommend that older adults at risk of falls are referred to appropriate fall-prevention exercise programs (USPSTF Level B). Despite this evidence, many older adults do not receive appropriate referrals and support for fall-prevention exercises, with one study finding that less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). Older people living in rural areas are more likely to fall but are less likely to participate in fall prevention programs. Advances in computing technology can help to identify older people at risk of falls and disseminate guidance about the most effective interventions using clinical decision support (CDS) systems. Patients can be supported in their exercise programs through a patient-focused App distributed through the PCP or through content on their patient portal. Well-implemented CDS that is integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) can support prescribing or recommending effective strategies and engaging patients in fall prevention decision-making thus integrating evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice. The long-term goal of our research program is to enhance the safety of community-based older adults by reducing falls through an effective patient-centered learning health system called eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS). With eSTEPS, an exercise algorithm will be integrated into the EHR which will trigger a Best Practice Alert (BPA) and Smart Set to provide actionable CDS within primary care clinic workflows and facilitate the use of CDS with patients to ensure evidence-based recommendations are tailored to patient preferences. The resulting fall prevention exercise care plan will be sent to the EHR as a note and to a patient-facing App for the patient to view after their visit. In this proposal we will use traditional fall risk screening and machine learning approaches to accurately identify older adults at risk for falls. We will then develop, CDS implemented into the electronic health record that helps primary care providers and older patients develop a tailored fall prevention exercise plan. We will conduct a cluster randomized control trial in urban and rural primary care clinics to test the efficacy of the eSTEPS CDS intervention. Development of the eSTEPS CDS within the widely adopted Epic EHR will support dissemination of evidence for older adults, with a focus on rural elders. NARRATIVE There is substantial evidence that conducting multifactorial fall risk assessments and developing personalized prevention plans in primary care settings can reduce falls, but many barriers exist to integrating this evidence into practice. The US Preventive Service Task Force recommends fall prevention exercises for community- dwelling adults who are at increased risk for falls, however less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). The goal of this project is to develop, test, and evaluate shareable, standards-based fall prevention clinical decision support, eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS) that can used by primary care providers to facilitate personalized activity and exercise prescriptions and reduce falls in at risk older adults.",electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS).,10049339,R61AG068926,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Prevention Guidelines', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Screening procedure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavior change', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'exercise prescription', 'exercise program', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'patient portal', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'rural area', 'screening', 'smartphone Application', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R61,2020,250020,0.060385604582066536
"Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care Project Abstract The opioid epidemic is the U.S.'s most widespread behavioral public health problem, with a higher number of deaths due to drug overdose in 2016 compared to deaths due to HIV at the peak of the AIDS epidemic. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. However, only a fraction of persons with OUD access MAT, and treatment non-adherence and drop out is common. There is a dire need to improve systems to address these issues and to expand the use of MAT for many patients who are out of care. This R44 STTR application responds to RFA-DA-19-020, “HEAL Initiative: America's Startups and Small Businesses Build Technologies to Stop the Opioid Crisis.” It joins an outstanding scientific team at UCLA and a small business that has developed, Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) -- a software platform that by integrating with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) improves clinical management of patients by primary care providers (PCPs) treating patients with OUD using MAT. OARS platform uses a dashboard to show real-time measurement of patient achievements in recovery. It provides opportunities for patients to interact with their PCPs, allowing for better connection to and support from their PCPs. OARS platform features artificial intelligence to analyze information from the EHR and from patients to provide relapse risk assessment for patients receiving MAT for OUD, an innovation that sets OARS apart from other software solutions. The specific aim of Phase 1 of this STTR Fast Track proposal, is to modify the OARS platform for use in primary care settings by conducting interviews with PCPs (N=20) and their patients with OUD (N=40) in primary care settings to collect data on feasibility and acceptability of engaging with OARS to inform user- centered design of OARS. The specific aims of Phase 2 of this STTR Fast Track proposal are to: (1) employ a “stepped wedge” design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes across 6 treatment programs (N=200 treated patients) and (2) evaluate sustainability and return on investment of OARS implementation across 6 treatment programs. A commercialization plan documents progress to date for OARS platform and presents a market plan to improve both scale-up and quality of MAT services delivered by PCPs in primary care, which is a major contribution to addressing the ongoing opioid epidemic. Project Narrative With over 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017, of which 47,600 are attributable to opioid overdose, the opioid epidemic has become North America’s most widespread behavioral public health problem. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. The Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS), comprises of a healthcare team portal connected to a patient mobile application, to provide opioid related education, promote connectedness with clinicians, and track MAT treatment progress. This STTR Fast Track proposal will conduct interviews with patients that will inform optimal design of OARS and utilize a “stepped wedge” effectiveness design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes in primary care settings and evaluate sustainability and return on investment.",Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care,10212519,R42DA050398,"['Abstinence', 'Achievement', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer software', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'HIV', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'North America', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Suboxone', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'care providers', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'medical specialties', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mobile application', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'patient population', 'phase 2 testing', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse risk', 'scale up', 'social stigma', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'user centered design', 'waiver']",NIDA,"Q2I, LLC",R42,2020,833315,0.023990563657102327
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,9934286,R01NR016732,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Nursing', 'Research', 'Self Management', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain health', 'care costs', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'design', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health care delivery', 'health management', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'personalized intervention', 'physical conditioning', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smart home', 'social', 'technology validation', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'usability']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,354490,0.036278442850991514
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9869872,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'comparison intervention', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'nonmedical use', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,547843,0.012641549366951565
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions: Supplement to focus on Alzheimer's and/or other dementias PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The primary objective of the parent study is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. This supplement extends our design to monitor, assess, and intervene for individuals with ADRDs and their caregivers. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smartwatches, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to train algorithms for health assessment (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to extend brain health and objectively capture intervention both adherence and caregiver support (Aim 3). Clinician guidance is used to train machine learning algorithms to automatically recognize health events (Aim 4). Given the unique challenges that will arise when we include individuals with ADRDs, we also introduce novel methods to track multiple residents in smart environments (Aim 5) and compare behaviors between individuals with ADRDs and the original sample of older adults with chronic health conditions (Aim 6). These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society.

"iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY The integrated research and training plans outlined in this K23 submission will prepare me for a career as a clinician-scientist conducting translational substance abuse research. My career goal is to perform hypothesis- driven original research investigations directed toward reducing morbidity and mortality from opioid overdose. In this proposal, I intend to deploy wearable biosensors (small devices that continuously record physiology) to study the effects of therapeutic administration of opioid analgesics. I have already studied wearable biosensors in individuals receiving opioids; my preliminary data demonstrates that opioid-tolerant individuals have different biometric signals than non-tolerant individuals. This observation suggests that biosensors can be used to identify the onset of tolerance, an important event that correlates with higher doses of opioid analgesics, and higher risk of death from opioid overdose. Biosensor data management and analysis requires signal processing, data analytic, and machine learning techniques; these approaches are beyond the areas of traditional medical training. My short-term goal is to utilize this K23 award to fill my knowledge gaps in wearable biosensing and advanced data analysis so that I can generate ever more innovative responses to the problem of opioid prescribing, tolerance, misuse, addiction, and overdose. To optimize this important line of investigation, I have developed a training plan that includes: 1) completing a PhD through the Millennium PhD program; 2) expanding my skills in wearable biosensing and behavioral health-based research; 3) developing an understanding of signal processing and machine learning; 4) developing data analytic and data science skills; and 5) expanding my research presentation and dissemination skills. I will achieve these goals through directed coursework, focused seminars, and practical experience. My mentorship team of expert investigators who will ensure my productivity and success includes E. Boyer (primary mentor), D. Smelson, J. Fang, and P. Indic (secondary mentors), and D. Ganesan (advisor) My research plan has three specific aims: 1) to deploy a wearable biosensor technology to detect digital biomarkers associated with the initiation of opioid analgesic therapy in an opioid naïve population; 2) to use signal-processing analytics to identify transitions in digital biomarkers with progressive opioid use and to identify individual characteristics associated with this transition; and, 3) to apply and explore supervised learning algorithms that can predict transitions in digital biomarkers that herald the onset of opioid tolerance. To identify dynamic patterns in response to opioids, I will study the digital biomarkers of opioid-naïve patients with acute fractures who are prescribed opioid analgesics. Results will be used to develop “big data” approaches to apply predictive algorithms to identify the onset of opioid tolerance. This work has the potential to prevent development of problematic opioid use and will provide the basis for subsequent R01 submissions to implement sensor-based interventions triggered by the onset of tolerance in individuals receiving opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to opioids (both prescription and illicit) has reached staggering proportions: more than half of individuals who currently abuse heroin report that opioid abuse began with a prescription opioid. Dr. Carreiro has demonstrated that wearable biosensors can discriminate between individuals who are naïve to the effects of opioids from those who are opioid tolerant, a characteristic that increases risk for opioid-related death. This career development award will provide her with the training to use of wearable biosensors to identify the onset of opioid tolerance and the expertise to reach her ultimate goal of developing tools to prevent opioid-related death and increase the safety of opioid prescribing.",iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals,9889092,K23DA045242,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug abuse', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heroin Abuse', 'Immersion', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'career', 'comparative', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'digital', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opiate tolerance', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K23,2020,188616,0.02707481522102818
"Polypharmacy, Potentially Inappropriate Medications, and Adverse Outcomes in Older Adults with Advanced Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Polypharmacy (PP), or the concurrent use of multiple medications, affects up to 80% of older adults with cancer. It is associated with the use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), which have risk greater than benefit in older adults. In older adults with cancer, PP/PIMs have been associated in some studies with adverse outcomes, including poor adherence to and tolerance of cancer therapy and decrease in physical functioning. However, these data have been inconsistent, and studies to date have examined specific populations (such as disease-specific subgroups enrolled in clinical trials) that may not be representative of the general population of older adults with cancer. This proposal presents a 2-year research and career development plan focused on examining a cohort (n=370) of older adults with advanced cancer receiving chemotherapy in community oncology clinics. This is a secondary analysis of the control arm of the Geriatric Assessment Intervention for Patients Aged 70 and Over Receiving Chemotherapy or Similar Agents for Advanced Cancer (“GAP”): Reducing Toxicity in Older Adults study (URCC 13059, principal investigator is primary mentor Dr. Mohile), describing prevalence and patterns of PP/PIMs as well as the relationship of PP/PIMs to adverse outcomes including relative dose intensity of chemotherapy (RDI, a ratio of received to standard doses of chemotherapy), chemotherapy toxicity, and functional trajectory. The candidate, Dr. Erika Ramsdale, is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Rochester and is board-certified in both Oncology and Geriatric Medicine. This proposal builds upon her prior systematic review of PP/PIMs in older patients with cancer, showing the limited data available in the literature, and her work demonstrating that PP/PIMs are associated with functional impairments in older adults with advanced cancer prior to initiating chemotherapy. The aims of the proposed study are: 1/to test the hypotheses that PP/PIMs rates will be higher than reported in most prior studies, and over-the-counter medications will comprise the majority of PIMs detected; 2/to examine the association of PP/PIMs and the following adverse outcomes in older adults with cancer starting chemotherapy: chemotherapy tolerability at 3 months (RDI, grade 3-5 chemotherapy toxicity), and functional decline over 3 months. An exploratory aim will also compare the performance of regression and other supervised classification methods to model and predict factors influencing chemotherapy toxicity, including PP/PIMs and functional status. The proposal describes a comprehensive mentorship and training plan to develop complementary skills and knowledge in in polypharmacy, quantitative analysis, and data science. Under the guidance of her primary mentor Dr. Supriya Mohile, co-mentors Dr. Holly Holmes and Dr. Martin Zand, and advisor Dr. Eva Culakova, she will advance her skills in these areas with the long-term goal of becoming an independent geriatric oncology researcher implementing and testing multi-level interventions to address polypharmacy in older adults with cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polypharmacy, or taking multiple concurrent medications, is very common in older adults with cancer receiving cancer treatment, and increases the risk of taking one or more medications which are “potentially inappropriate” based on having higher risk than benefit in older adults. Polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications may be associated with adverse outcomes such as chemotherapy toxicity and functional decline in older adults with cancer. This proposal will examine the prevalence of polypharmacy, patterns of medication use, and impact of polypharmacy on tolerability of cancer treatment and functional trajectory in older patients with advanced cancer receiving chemotherapy.","Polypharmacy, Potentially Inappropriate Medications, and Adverse Outcomes in Older Adults with Advanced Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy",10027448,R03AG067977,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Antihistamines', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Pharmacists', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Companions', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Holly', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical Performance', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Role', 'Series', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'age related', 'aged', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'career development', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'i(19)', 'impaired functional status', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'interest', 'older patient', 'professor', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'symposium', 'systematic review']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R03,2020,154000,0.07590320767841441
"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood. In a more globally connected and computerized world, older adults may constitute particular at-risk targets for highly effective forms of online financial fraud, such as through social engineering in the form of emails containing malicious links or attachments (phishing). Susceptibility to financial deception in aging has been investigated primarily in the context of age-related cognitive decline, while socioemotional and neurophysiological parameters have been largely understudied. Further, there are few effective approaches to characterize, monitor and detect, and eventually prevent, financial deception. The objectives of the proposed research are threefold: Aim 1 will determine financial deception risk across the adult life span. This aim will seek to confirm that age is associated with greater susceptibility to financial deception, online and in person. Aim 2 will characterize cognitive, socioemotional, and neurophysiological mechanisms associated with deception risk. Specifically, this aim will uncover the extent to which cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction, age-related dampening in neurophysiological reactivity, and structural and functional brain changes contribute to increased susceptibility in aging. Aim 3 involves the development and psychometric validation of a novel risk assessment interview and the development of an automated deception warning tool to alert older adults about potential online fraud. Our research design will span three data collection phases comprising healthy young, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old individuals. Leveraging infrastructure developed in our lab, a behavioral field experiment will determine real-life susceptibility to financial fraud via simulated phishing email attacks (Phase I). A comprehensive in-lab assessment of cognitive/socioemotional and neurophysiological mechanisms will follow (Phase II and III, respectively). A data-analytic Phase IV will integrate data collected across Phases I-III using statistical and machine-learning methods. This multidisciplinary approach, encompassing psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering will lay the foundation for building an integrated approach to risk detection and the provision of financial decision-making supports in older adulthood. Findings and methodologies developed as part of this project have the potential to inform real-life decision-supportive interventions that adopt an age-targeted approach towards the long-term goal of financial risk reduction in older individuals. Project Narrative A rapidly aging population means that financial deception of the aged is an emerging public health problem that requires surveillance and intervention. An increasingly common form of financial fraud is conducted online as older adults more and more manage their assets online. The project goal is to determine cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological risk factors for financial deception in older adults and validate risk assessment and develop detection tools toward a long-term goal of identifying individuals who are particularly susceptible to financial fraud and facilitating prevention and decision-supportive intervention efforts.",Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging,9970378,R01AG057764,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Deception', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Educational Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Foundations', 'Fraud', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Structure', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Transact', 'Validation', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cyber security', 'decision-making capacity', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'financial decision making', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'phishing', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social factors', 'statistical and machine learning', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2020,322426,0.08338240354593988
"Individualized Vestibular Rehabilitation for Elderly with Self-Management and Gaming Elements Project Summary/Abstract: Vestibular rehabilitation has been proven to be effective in reducing dizziness and falls in older adults, but patient adherence is a major problem. Recent research shows that less than half of patients complete their rehabilitation. Some of the main reasons for this are the numerous visits that are required and accessibility. In particular for older individuals who experience dizziness and/or falls, it may be difficult to travel to attend rehabilitation sessions. Additionally, rehabilitation programs become expensive in terms of equipment and health professional’s time. Programs may also not be available to all who may benefit because of geographical limitations. Previous research has shown that remote monitoring and gaming elements have great potential to solve these issues, even in an older population. However, current solutions are generic and effectiveness can be inconsistent. The overall goal of this project is to develop a vestibular rehabilitation app to be used by older adults at home. The app will improve adherence through gaming, self-management, and remote monitoring. Patients will use low-cost sensors placed on their bodies (head and waist) to play the games on the app. This allows simultaneous monitoring of patient progress while performing the exercises. This data can be shared with a clinician via email or the cloud, allowing the patient to perform the rehabilitation at their home and the clinician to monitor how well the patients performed their exercises. The vestibular rehabilitation components are packaged in a phone and tablet app that is easy to navigate for older individuals and has a modular design that allows individualized rehabilitation. By improving patient engagement and enjoyment, rehabilitation adherence should be improved as well. Phase I demonstrated feasibility of this approach. In Phase II, games will be added to cover a full at-home rehabilitation session and improve usability of the app. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be developed to provide real-time feedback if exercises are performed incorrectly. This ensures patients will perform their exercises correctly when at home. As in Phase I, clinical collaborators will provide continued guidance and testing throughout development to ensure clinical relevance and promote adoption during commercialization. This project uses a novel approach in that it develops rehabilitation games specifically designed for vestibular rehabilitation through a mobile app tailored for an older population. Current gaming approaches for rehabilitation typically use existing or commercial games. The use of sensors for remote monitoring is also novel in this area and allows patients to perform rehabilitation at their home, while being monitored by a clinician. This project is therefore likely to have a high clinical impact. It will advance clinical practice, make vestibular rehabilitation more accessible to older individuals, and help adherence to programs. Successful implementation of this program will reduce falls and improve quality of life of for patients. Project Narrative: The overall goal of this project is to develop an app for older individuals that will improve accessibility of vestibular rehabilitation and that will improve compliance compared to current rehabilitation programs. The proposed effort uses a novel approach that combines low-cost inertial sensors and machine learning algorithms with mobile device technology to measure performance, provide real-time feedback, and present data in a comprehensible way to the clinician via email or the cloud, removing the patients’ need to travel for rehabilitation sessions. These features are packaged in an app that is appropriate for and appealing to older users to improve compliance, and uses novel gaming elements specifically developed for vestibular rehabilitation rather than repurposing existing commercial games designed for younger users and entertainment.",Individualized Vestibular Rehabilitation for Elderly with Self-Management and Gaming Elements,10011222,R44DC017408,"['Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dizziness', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Exercise', 'Eye', 'Fall prevention', 'Feedback', 'Florida', 'Focus Groups', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Health care facility', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Kansas', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Older Population', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Self Management', 'Software Design', 'Supervision', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'falls', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient engagement', 'physical therapist', 'programs', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation science', 'remote sensor', 'sensor', 'usability', 'visual tracking', 'web portal']",NIDCD,CFD RESEARCH CORPORATION,R44,2020,680368,0.007790021842139776
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,10007879,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2020,156859,0.07221116368957328
"Improving patient and caregiver engagement through the application of data science methods to audio recorded clinic visits stored in personal health libraries PROJECT SUMMARY    Forty to eighty percent of clinic visit information is forgotten by patients immediately post visit, a significant  barrier to self-­management leading to poor health outcomes. Visit summaries can improve recall, yet patient  uptake is limited and clinicians report significant burden in creating summaries for laypeople. Patients are  beginning to audio record visits and clinics are now offering this service. When patients receive a clinic  recording, 71% listen and 68% share it with a caregiver, resulting in improved understanding and self-­ management. Yet, unstructured recordings are difficult to navigate. Personal health libraries (PHLs) may help  patients organize health information;; yet current PHLs do not facilitate clinic-­recordings. The objective of this  project is to develop a PHL that integrates clinic audio-­recordings (Audio-­PHL), using data science methods to  link medical terms from the recording to trustworthy patient resources, which can be retrieved, organized,

strategies of older adults with multimorbidity and caregivers;; Aim 2 Develop an Audio-­PHL using data science  methods to securely analyze clinic visit recordings and make this information accessible and understandable  for patients;; and Aim 3 Demonstrate the usability and use of an Audio-­PHL in older adults with multimorbidity  and caregivers. Applicants hypothesize: (1) The Audio-­PHL will surpass acceptable usability metrics in older  adults and caregivers and (2) natural language processing (NLP) methods developed for the Audio-­PHL will  accurately identify key visit information (e.g. medication) and connect it to credible patient resources. The  development of the Audio-­PHL follows a user centered design model. In Aim 1, the applicants will use  participatory design activities with 48 end-­users to inform Audio-­PHL design. In Aim 2, the Audio-­PHL will be  created in iterative cycles informed by findings from Aim 1. In Aim 3, extensive usability evaluation will be  conducted in human computer interaction (HCI) laboratory settings to ensure Audio-­PHL surpasses acceptable  usability metrics. Field testing of the Audio-­PHL will follow via a patient-­randomized pilot trial with older adults  with multimorbidity from primary care. Participants (N=70) will receive an Audio-­PHL (intervention) or PHL  (control) with no recordings. Usability metrics and satisfaction will be assessed at one-­month. Preliminary data  on the impact of an Audio-­PHL on patient ability to seek, find and use health information with high confidence,  patient activation and caregiver confidence will also be gathered. The research is innovative because it will  provide patients and caregivers secure access to a PHL based on clinic-­recordings that uses data science  methods to organize visit information and connect it to trusted resources. The results are expected to have a

"A Telehealth Advance Care Planning Intervention for COVID-19 in New York City The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has highlighted the importance of advance care planning (ACP) for older patients who are most at risk of dying, and a critical need exists to optimize this process. ACP empowers patients to express their values and goals for care before they become too ill to do so. ACP also prepares patients, and their families, to make difficult decisions in real time when the moment arises. For older patients, COVID-19 may result in respiratory failure and high mortality rates. However, many older patients may prefer to avoid these interventions, especially if the mortality rate is high and death is experienced alone in the hospital without family nearby. Motivated by the disproportionate risk to older patients from COVID-19 and the higher mortality rates, primary care clinicians should engage all older patients with ACP to ensure their preferences are known and honored. Unfortunately, many clinicians have not been trained in ACP and patients are unfamiliar with it.  To address this gap, we have developed a Comprehensive Telehealth ACP Program for COVID-19 that implements ACP routinely into medical care and responds to the present need for virtual communication. The ACP Program combines two well-tested, evidence-based, and complementary interventions: online clinician communication skills training and ACP patient video decision aids. The overall objective of this application is to reduce the burden of COVID-19 and its consequences for an aging US population that may prefer to forgo aggressive potentially ineffective interventions, and to die outside of the hospital setting. To accomplish this, we propose to conduct a Pre-Post trial using an open cohort design of a telehealth ACP Program among older patients in the nation's COVID-19 epicenter, New York. We will train 250 primary care clinicians caring for 25,000 diverse patients over the age of 65 from the largest health care system in New York (Northwell Health). We will use Natural Language Processing to abstract our outcomes from the electronic health records for patients. We hypothesize that a telehealth ACP Program of clinician serious illness communication skills training combined with ACP videos will improve and sustain rates of ACP from the time that the intervention is implemented compared to the time prior to the intervention.  Clinician communication training and video decision support is a practical, evidence-based, and innovative approach to uniformly provide robust ACP. Major strengths of this proposal are: the highly experienced team making this project feasible; the present infrastructure already embedded at Northwell Health, which has the largest number of COVID-19 patients in the US; and, the potential immediate deployment of the intervention, if successful, across the country. This work holds the promise of improving the quality of care provided to millions of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has dramatically shown the need for advance care planning (ACP) by older patients who are most at risk of dying, and there is a critical need to optimize this process. Communication skills training for clinicians and patient-facing video decision aids have shown promising efficacy for improving patient-clinician communication, increasing ACP documentation, and leading to more patient-centered care. This proposal seeks to assess the effectiveness of a Comprehensive Telehealth ACP Program for increasing documented ACP conversations, improving clarification of resuscitation preferences', and enhancing palliative care and hospice utilization in 25,000 patients at Northwell Health, the largest health care system in New York and the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.",A Telehealth Advance Care Planning Intervention for COVID-19 in New York City,10170786,UH3AG060626,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Aging', 'American', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Communication', 'Consultations', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intubation', 'Life', 'Loneliness', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Resuscitation', 'Resuscitation Orders', 'Risk', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'acute care', 'cohort', 'comparison intervention', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'hospice environment', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'older patient', 'pandemic disease', 'patient health information', 'patient-clinician communication', 'pragmatic trial', 'preference', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIA,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,UH3,2020,2405961,0.01888580092794463
"A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults Abstract  People aged 65+ will represent 21% of the U.S. population and increase to about 80 million by 2040, and the oldest old (age 85+) will number ~ 14.1 million. Population aging presents both opportunities and challenges for our healthcare, the economy, and existing social support systems. Many older adults especially the oldest old, minorities and those of lower Socio-Economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, poor diet, and decreased levels of physical activity each of which influence morbidity and mortality. Mobile-based, tablet-based, and in-home technologies provide an excellent opportunity for projecting behavior- change interventions and social support into the everyday life of older adults at great economies of scale. The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system, designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2) the Fittle+ mobile platform designed to support positive health behavior change through integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence (AI). The study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1 we will develop and pilot test the FSS with representative samples of older adults. Phase 2 will involve a two group randomized trial where participants will be randomized to the Fittle Senior System (FSS, an adaptive coaching and social support system using mobile technology) or to a paper-based psycho-educational (BPE) control condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at risk for social isolation (90 per condition - 30 White Caucasians, 30 Black/African Americans and 30 Hispanic Americans). We will recruit males and females commensurate to the gender proportions represented in this age group and work to ensure that we have sufficient representation from the “oldest old” cohort. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on clinically significant measures of health and health behaviors and indices of social support. We will also gather information on potential moderating (e.g., ethnicity, age) and mediating variables (e.g., health self-efficacy), which will be examined using multilevel modeling techniques guided by current theories of behavior change and technology acceptance and use among older adults. Project Narrative This proposed project is addressing a critical public concern. The population is aging and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are common among older adults especially ethnic minorities. This study will develop and evaluate a mobile technology-based intervention designed to support positive health behavior change among diverse older adults through integrated online social support, personalized coaching and goal setting.",A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults,9928376,R01AG053163,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caucasians', 'Chronic', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Industry', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Jordan', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Support System', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'active method', 'age group', 'aged', 'aging and technology', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinically significant', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'dynamic system', 'education research', 'efficacy trial', 'ethnic minority population', 'family structure', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'low socioeconomic status', 'male', 'medical schools', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'nutrition', 'programs', 'psychoeducational', 'psychoeducational intervention', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social factors', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,736726,0.04272646449670042
"Mechanisms of sleep deficiency and effects on brain injury and neurocognitive functions among older blacks Project Summary Translational studies showing a mechanistic interplay between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis and sleep/circadian disruption has renewed interest in the maxim ‘sleep is of the brain, by the brain, and for the brain’. Relative to adults sleeping well, those exhibiting sleep deficiency (SD), defined as poor sleep, sleep apnea, and/or circadian misalignment, have greater AD risk (OR=1.55), cognitive decline (OR=1.68), or preclinical AD (OR=3.78). Since SD is observed early in the course of AD, it constitutes a prime target for prevention. Notwithstanding successes in delineating the mechanisms and functions of sleep, a critical gap remains in elucidating factors undergirding sleep disparities among blacks, marked by a greater AD risk burden. Blacks also shoulder a greater sleep burden as evidenced by a higher prevalence of the main SD indices, which are linked to increased vascular risks, inflammation, brain injury, and cognitive impairment. The multi-disciplinary team will utilize innovative dynamic and geospatial modeling in a multi-level framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants of SD and its putative effects on the brain health of older blacks. We will leverage the success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup, comprising investigators with expertise in aging research, translational sleep and circadian sciences, brain health, health disparities, and geospatial and multi-level dynamic modeling. We will leverage the social capital and assets of our Community Steering Committee to enroll 504 blacks (60-75 years) from traditional and non-traditional venues to capture study endpoints. We will investigative the following aims: 1) To ascertain the psychosocial (social/emotional support, mood, discrimination, attitudes) and environmental (household [density, noise, air quality, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital, neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with SD; 2) To assess effects of SD on markers of brain injury (Hcy, NFL, GFAP, Tau & Amyloid-β peptides) and on neurocognitive functions (attention, language, memory, and executive function using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite and Trail Making Test). The contributions of vascular risk (obesity, BP, lipid, and glucose/HbA1C) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) will be weighted; 3) To characterize blacks who are at increased risk of SD using Bayesian machine-learning modeling and forecast through Agent-Based modeling which amalgamation of psychosocial and environmental changes will lead to a reduced SD burden and related brain health profile among older blacks over time (5, 10, & 20 yrs.). The investigative team will use novel home-based digital recorders, innovative brain health biomarkers, geospatial analytics and dynamic systems modeling to describe the mechanisms of SD and delineate their potential role in explaining observed disparities in markers of brain health of older blacks. Project Narrative Despite the high risk for sleep-related morbidity, there is a paucity of data on sleep-disrupting psychosocial and environmental stressors associated with sleep deficiency (poor sleep, sleep apnea, and/or circadian misalignment) among older blacks.

"Multimorbidity and Treatment-Related Outcomes in Older Heart Failure Patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) is the most common reason for hospitalization in older adults. Over 85% of all patients hospitalized with HF are 65 years of age or older. Multimorbidity, typically defined as the presence of ≥2 chronic conditions, increases the risks of hospitalization and death in older HF patients, and greatly complicates the clinical management of HF. Caution is required in applying national clinical practice guidelines to the care of older adults with multimorbidity, as this could result in undesirable net effects and less than optimal outcomes including adverse interactions between drugs and various concomitant diseases. In response to PA-17-088 (Exploratory Analyses of Existing Cohorts, Data Sets, and Stored Biospecimens to Address Clinical Aging Research Questions, R01), we propose to leverage an existing HF cohort, including data for more than 100,000 patients with HF within the Cardiovascular Research Network between 2005-2012, with follow-up data up to 2017. We will extend our previous efforts by examining treatment patterns and the net benefits versus harms of selected therapies in older adults with HF and a wide spectrum of multimorbidity burden. We will further examine the benefits and adverse outcomes of various therapies focusing on particularly vulnerable subgroups of patients with HF afflicted by two prevalent conditions, anemia or diabetes. Our specific aims are: (1) to examine the effectiveness of selected medical therapies (renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system blockers, beta-blockers, diuretics, and aldosterone receptor blockers) on death, HF hospitalization, and all-cause hospitalizations in a large, community-based population of older adults with HF across a range of levels of multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction; (2) to evaluate targeted adverse outcomes, including kidney dysfunction, hyperkalemia, sodium disturbances, bradycardia, and syncope associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF, stratified by multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction status; and (3) to characterize the potential benefits and adverse outcomes associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF and two prevalent comorbidity dyads—HF- diabetes and HF-anemia—that are common and substantially increase the risks of death and morbidity. In addition, we will create novel, validated methods to identify adverse outcomes related to HF therapies from unstructured data in large electronic health record systems through natural language processing technology, along with employing state-of-the-art analytic approaches to evaluate treatment-related outcomes. In that our proposed investigation will take advantage of a large, geographically and demographically diverse cohort of adults with HF receiving care within community-based healthcare delivery systems, we anticipate our findings will be highly generalizable to the broad spectrum of older adults with HF managed in “real-world” practice settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The presence of multiple chronic conditions, or multimorbidity, in older adults with heart failure substantially increases the complexity of their care, and increases the risks of hospitalization and death. In our study, we will examine treatment patterns and the net benefits versus harms of selected therapies in patients with heart failure and multimorbidity.

"Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST) Imaging in Cognitive Aging Healthy older adults (HOA) confront complex and life-changing decisions in the face of declining neural resources. Changes in aged brains include shrinkage of neurons and their projections in several areas, such as the neocortex, hippocampus and substantia nigra.1 These age-related structural brain changes, typically measured using in vivo techniques (e.g. MRI), reflect cellular changes. Glutamate (Glu) is a key molecule in cellular metabolism, the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system, and the principal neurotransmitter of cortical efferents.2,3 Alterations in brain Glu likely contribute to the neural mechanisms underlying age-related declines in behavioral and cognitive functions.4 Yet, only a few studies4-11 have investigated age-related changes in brain Glu, in vivo, during healthy aging. Most of these have used standard techniques and as a result our understanding of the role that brain Glu has in typical and atypical aging remains limited. Here, I aim to fill significant gaps in the field, by 1) assessing brain Glu using a novel magnetization transfer technique—Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST)—on an ultra-high field 7T MRI scanner, enables the measurement of brain Glu across the cerebrum in humans.12; 2) assess cognitive performance using a highly sensitive computerized neurocognitive battery (Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB)); and 3) explore the possibility of aging biotypes based upon age- related changes in brain glutamate.  Here, we propose to investigate alterations in brain glutamate in 100 HOA (60-85 years of age) using GluCEST 7T MRI and relate alterations in brain Glu to age-related changes in cognitive functioning, including, memory, and executive function. Moreover, we will contrast age-related patterns with data from young adults (18-30 years of age). Finally, we leverage data from a large consortium, iSTAGING (directed by Co- Investigator Davatzikos), to employ recently developed machine-learning techniques (e.g. HYDRA13), to classify subgroups of older adults based upon unique patterns of brain structure associated with typical, atypical and resilient aging. These subtypes will be applied within our sample and patterns of brain glutamate can then be measured within these subtypes. The proposed studies will provide more specific and sensitive in vivo measurements of brain glutamate in HOA. This proposal will enable testing of specific hypothesis about the regional distribution of brain Glu, its relation to aging, and its contribution to cognitive functioning in aging. As such, these studies can provide crucial preliminary data for longitudinal studies in healthy and pathological aging by targeting a specific neural mechanism associated with cognition and disease progression. RELEVANCE Older adults tend to focus on positive emotional information more than their younger counterparts. The psychological and neural mechanisms of this positivity bias remain unclear and it is possible that an age-related reduction in executive function contribute to this bias. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the positivity bias is maintained in those at risk for developing dementia. This positivity and and  roject aims to characterize this emergence of this bias across the lifespan and determine its role in the early stages of dementia those at risk for developing dementia using computerized assessment of emotion cognition. p",Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST) Imaging in Cognitive Aging,10241606,R56AG066656,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemicals', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Glutamates', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Metabolism', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reaction Time', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'brain size', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'executive function', 'frontal lobe', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pathological aging', 'psychologic', 'rapid growth', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R56,2020,532865,-0.006736077075938594
"Cardiovascular implications of sleep characteristics using real-world objective sleep data Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the U.S. Impaired sleep is recognized as a strong risk factor of CVD. Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, abnormal sleep duration, and poor sleep quality have each been associated with CVD-related morbidity and mortality. Major limitations of existing studies on sleep and CVD is the lack of objective sleep measurement and the lack of understanding of the multi-dimensional nature of sleep and its complex interactions with CVD. In addition, emerging evidence also suggests potential relationships between sleep disorders and preclinical CV conditions, which often occur before the clinical manifestation of CVD. Blood pressure parameters including systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV) and mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) are examples of preclinical CVD that have prognostic value for future CV events. However, no research has yet explored if sleep disorders beyond OSA (such as impaired sleep quality and abnormal sleep duration) are risk factors attributable to preclinical CV conditions. This is a critical area of inquiry since understanding the complex relationships between sleep and preclinical and clinical CV conditions will allow healthcare providers to implement targeted interventions to reduce CVD. The proposed study will examine whether PSG-derived objective measures of sleep obtained in the clinical setting would be predictive of CVD and preclinical CVD. Given that hypertension is one of the major important CV risks and has been most well studied CV risk factor in relation to sleep, SBPV, mean SBP, and other blood pressure metrics will be the focus of the preclinical CVD. Our main aim is to examine the relationships between multidimensional sleep characteristics (in terms of duration, efficiency, quality, and disordered sleep breathing) and clinical CV conditions, after adjusting for personal, clinical, and other confounders. We will use sleep data collected from more than 7,000 individuals who completed a diagnostic sleep study at the University of Virginia Health System in 2010 - 2018. Machine learning (ML) models will be used to analyze the multidimensional PSG measures. This proposed study represents the largest real-world dataset on objective sleep measures, which will allow us to simultaneously examine the entire spectrum of sleep and advance our understanding about the impact of sleep on CV outcomes. Project Narrative Impaired sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other adverse health outcomes. We will examine how various dimensions of sleep including duration, efficiency, and disordered breathing from polysomnography are related to cardiovascular risk within a healthcare setting. To better understand the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism, we will examine how sleep measures may affect blood pressure variability, an emerging yet underappreciated blood pressure parameter to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.",Cardiovascular implications of sleep characteristics using real-world objective sleep data,10048498,R21HL150502,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Manifestation', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Prevention Measures', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'REM Sleep', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'blood pressure variability', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'indexing', 'limb movement', 'mortality', 'pre-clinical', 'prognostic value', 'risk minimization', 'sleep abnormalities', 'sleep quality', 'sleep quantity', 'supervised learning']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2020,137730,0.020018944971182957
"Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic PROJECT SUMMARY Up-to-date information about non-fatal overdose emergency department (ED) encounters can provide critical information about the evolution of the opioid epidemic and response of the healthcare system and is an essential to planning of clinical trials to address the problems underlying this epidemic. Establishing a platform that delivers high positive predictive value for opioid-related overdose (OD) using a combination of coded and natural language terms in electronic health records (EHRs) is an essential step toward the large-scale surveillance necessary to evaluate the pragmatic effectiveness of numerous systemic and policy-based efforts and to create the infrastructure for large scale trials to reduce drug-related mortality and morbidity. However, to date, localized and federal efforts have been largely based on discrete ICD-10 code data or have had time lags of one-to-three years for more detailed data. Perhaps more Importantly, they have not had the capacity for planning and feasibility assessment for clinical and translational research at specific sites. We propose foundational work to create an inter-institutional research database and network focused on patients presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD. To create this network, we will extend previous work to develop: (1) an e-phenotype for case identification in the ED based on EHR data, and (2) combine this with a data dictionary and coded data extraction tools, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, to obtain additional data from EHRs; tools for primary capture of data during clinical care; and tools for integration of data on social determinants of health. This will allow for a more thorough characterization of individuals presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD including: demographics, comorbidities, OD agent and source, intentionality of the OD, ED treatment and discharge disposition. Through refinement and automation, the data extraction process will be extended to a set of pilot CTSA Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) Network sites and then potentially to other CTSA's nation-wide. This new functionality focuses on providing a platform to accelerate research. To accomplish this work, our Specific Aims are to: 1) Demonstrate the feasibility of extending the ACT Network data model and infrastructure to monitor the opioid epidemic using ED data, 2) Create a prototype opioid overdose monitoring and response network across participating institutions and a toolkit for other CTSA sites to join the network, and 3) Demonstrate potential usefulness of the network in monitoring the opioid epidemic and in planning clinical trials. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective near real time means of monitoring opioid-related OD presentation in EDs across the country to inform point-of-care service delivery, prevention and treatment intervention development and evaluation. Downstream, the application of project deliverables include dissemination of the replication toolkit to leverage the platform of the CTSAs and NIDA Clinical Trials Network to build capacity for timely surveillance of opioid-related OD to facilitate prevention and treatment research and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients presenting with opioid-related overdose to hospital emergency departments represent a high-risk group for morbidity and mortality and a potential target for interventions to combat the opioid epidemic. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective inter-institutional research database and network focused on these patients.

"Leveraging National Sleep Research Resource Data for Personalized Sleep Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY People vary in both the quantity and the quality of their sleep. Traditional sleep “stages” (for example, slow- wave sleep or REM sleep) can exhibit different neural correlates (as measured by electroencephalography, EEG) in different people and at different times during the night. Standard approaches for characterizing sleep (“staging”) do not take this variability into account, however. Here we suggest that attempts to use EEG and other data to infer sleep stages should in fact tackle the heterogeneity between and within individuals explicitly, to yield more accurate classification not just of an individual’s minute-by-minute sleep, but of the sleeper’s typical characteristics more generally. Quantitative, data-driven individual sleep profiles will be important prerequisites for emerging large-scale molecular genetics and other ‘omics studies of sleep, and for driving personalized sleep medicine more generally. Specifically, we propose to leverage more than ten thousand whole-night polysomnography (PSG) studies from the demographically diverse National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), in order to optimally apply machine-learning methods to sleep signals. Most importantly, the NSRR dataset will enable approaches that take the fundamental heterogeneity of sleep into account: this is a rate-limiting step that has not been tackled by previous approaches. We hypothesize that it is not the large training set per se, but rather the increased prospects for better-matched training data, combined with the methods developed here, that will be beneficial. To this end, we will build and disseminate a novel, multi-level automated sleep classifier based on the world’s largest dataset of sleep signals. PROJECT NARRATIVE People vary considerably not just in how much they sleep, but also in the types of sleep they typically have. Standard approaches to describing sleep, primarily developed in the 1960s, only partially capture this variability: we propose to use a range of measures, including brain activity, on over ten thousand sleeping individuals to generate more accurate, data-driven, personalized profiles of how a person's sleep varies over a night. Sleep factors are associated with multiple physical and neuropsychiatric illnesses, and so better measurement of the underlying processes will be critical for future genetic and biomarker studies aimed at understanding the links between sleep, health and disease.",Leveraging National Sleep Research Resource Data for Personalized Sleep Profiling,9852475,R01HL146339,"['Adult', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Label', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mythology', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Polysomnography', 'Process', 'Property', 'REM Sleep', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stage I Sleep', 'Stage II Sleep', 'Staging', 'Stretching', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'heuristics', 'implicit bias', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'molecular scale', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'open source', 'real world application', 'sleep health', 'sleep onset', 'tool', 'trait']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,444813,0.06852984656937043
"Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot randomized, controlled trial with outcomes assessment using digital phenotyping Over 15 million Americans serve as family caregivers of relatives with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD- Related Dementias (ADRD), and this often subjects them to tremendous stress, resulting in poorer mental health and higher risk of physical illness. Due to emotional and physical exhaustion, lack of time, and immediate needs related to caring for their loved ones, caregivers often forego their own self-care. The National Institute on Aging Strategic Plan identifies the need to develop better interventions to improve the mental and physical health of caregivers as a crucial priority area. The purpose of this Paul B. Beeson K76 Emerging Leaders Career Development Award in Aging Research application is to support the research training of Dr. Felipe Jain, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Jain’s work aims to improve caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone with guided imagery and mindfulness therapies that reduce stress and help the caregiver improve mentalizing (understanding the links between mind and behavior) of themselves, their loved one suffering from dementia and others in their social milieu. Further, Dr. Jain hopes to develop the skills in machine learning and data science necessary to estimate early changes in caregiver symptoms remotely and passively, without any additional effort on the part of the caregiver who is often already overwhelmed, using smartphone sensors that capture information about caregiver behaviors.  In the conduct of this K76 award, Dr. Jain will lead a randomized, controlled trial for 120 AD/ADRD caregivers 60 years of age or older. Caregivers will be assigned to receive smartphone applications that either include a caregiver skills toolbox alone, or a caregiver skills toolbox combined with Mentalizing Imagery Therapy (MIT). MIT uses guided imagery and mindfulness to help caregivers improve stress, reduce negative mood and increase mentalizing. Theoretically, stress reduction resulting from MIT due both to mindfulness skills and better mentalizing of the care recipient and others should help caregivers better implement tools for caregiving within their unique social environment and accounting for the care recipient’s individual symptoms.  The first aim of the study is to determine the clinical effects of App-delivered caregiver skills with or without MIT on caregivers’ perceived stress, caregiver burden, mastery, depression and insomnia. The second aim is to develop behavioral markers from smartphone sensors that are associated with outcomes. We will (1) test the hypothesis that smartphone estimated sleep is longitudinally associated with caregivers’ self-reported insomnia, stress and burden and (2) determine the feasibility of identifying behavioral features with machine learning to predict day-to-day sleep and stress. If successful, this research will help open a new avenue of AD/ADRD caregiver research and treatment focused on improving mentalizing. It will also inform the field of aging research regarding the feasibility of using smartphone sensors to detect changes in early behavioral markers that may be used by clinicians to intervene for older adults at risk of poor outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research will promote the public health of more than 15 million Americans who serve as family caregivers for relatives with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. It will assess whether stress reduction therapy incorporating guided imagery practices that promote perspective taking and empathy can improve the effects of family caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone. It will also test the feasibility of using smartphone estimated markers to track caregiver insomnia and stress, which could eventually help reduce caregiver suffering and healthcare costs by identifying early warning signs of treatment failure and symptomatic worsening.","Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot randomized, controlled trial with outcomes assessment using digital phenotyping",10045735,K76AG064390,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic stress', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotional Stress', 'Empathy', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Friends', 'Guided imagery', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Mindfulness Training', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self Care', 'Sleep', 'Sleeplessness', 'Social Environment', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'care giving burden', 'care recipients', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiving', 'clinical effect', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'exhaustion', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'loved ones', 'medical schools', 'mental imagery', 'mindfulness', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'negative mood', 'novel therapeutics', 'perceived stress', 'physical conditioning', 'predict clinical outcome', 'primary caregiver', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychological symptom', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'skills', 'skills training', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'stress reduction', 'tool']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K76,2020,213157,-0.03976143591361572
"Sense4Safety: Supporting socially vulnerable older adults Abstract Falls and fall-related injuries are significant public health issues for adults 65 years of age and older. Over a third of older adults (OA) fall each year and 10-20% of falls result in serious injuries such as fractures and head trauma. The annual direct medical costs in the US as a result of falls are estimated to exceed $50 billion, and this estimate does not include the indirect costs of disability, dependence, and decreased quality of life. This project targets community dwelling OA with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are socially vulnerable. MCI is a leading risk factor for falls in OA. Approximately 15%-20% of OA have MCI, and over 60% of OA with MCI fall annually – two to three times the rate of those without cognitive impairment. Socially vulnerable OA living in low-resource neighborhoods with poor housing conditions have twice the risk of falling. We have developed an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk. The purpose of this study is to refine the Sense4Safety intervention based on extensive feedback by low income OA with MCI, their family members or trusted others and clinicians in order to ensure that the passive monitoring system to predict fall risk for OA with MCI can generate actionable and tailored information that can be used effectively by these stakeholder groups.

"Enhanced Measurement and Modeling of Sleep Electrophysiology to Better Understand Sleep Disparities Project Summary Health disparities associated with race and ethnicity are a major public health issue in the United States. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that differences in people's quality and quantity of sleep may account for part of this problem. Here we wish to study patterns of sleep, using full polysomnography data in a large and diverse cohort, to better understand what causes some individuals and groups to differ in their typical sleep, and to link this variation in sleep to relevant health outcomes. In order to study sleep as a mediator of health disparities associated with race/ethnicity, we propose to first unpack the “sleep” term into profiles of quantitative traits (Aim 1). Second, we will test for demographic moderators of the associations between race/ethnicity and sleep traits, which can point to likely socioeconomic and social/environmental contextual mediators (Aim 2). Finally, we will demonstrate the relevance of these findings by testing for association with health outcomes – primarily cardiovascular disease risk and measures of allostatic load – and estimating the extent to which sleep accounts for racial/ethnic health disparities (Aim 3). We will apply a targeted array of data-driven analytic methods, from data science, machine learning, computational neuroscience and causal modeling, to characterize individual differences in patterns of sleep. A more nuanced understanding of what constitutes “poor sleep” is important because different aspects of sleep are likely to have qualitatively different links to demographic and biomedical factors, including age, sex, lifestyle factors, inherited genetic makeup, circadian rhythms, medication effects and current state of physical and mental health. By disentangling this network of inter-related variables, we will be better positioned to understand – and ameliorate – the effects of the numerous factors that can induce racial/ethnic disparities in sleep, and consequently, in health too. Project Narrative Health disparities associated with race and ethnicity are a major public health issue in the United States. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that differences in people’s quality and quantity of sleep may account for part of this problem.

"Using the Electronic Health Record to Identify and Promote Goals-of-Care Communication for Older Patients with Serious Illness Although discussions that address patients' goals of care are one of the most important aspects of palliative care, this communication is often lacking in our healthcare system. Goals-of-care communication is associated with improved patient and family outcomes and reduced intensity of care at the end of life. Electronic health records (EHR) provide a key opportunity to identify patients who would benefit from these discussions and to promote these discussions, yet prior interventions have not used the EHR for this purpose.  Older adults with chronic illness, and particularly those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), are especially vulnerable to inappropriately intensive end-of-life care. To address this shortcoming, we build on two of our most successful programs, one using the EHR to identify goals-of-care discussions and the other a novel intervention called Jumpstart that promotes and enhances these discussions. We will examine the effectiveness of the Jumpstart intervention for hospitalized older adults with chronic illness and specifically oversample those with ADRD to understand the effectiveness of the intervention in this key group.  We propose 2 linked, complementary randomized trials. Trial 1, a pragmatic trial, compares usual care with a clinician-facing Jumpstart for hospitalized older adults with serious illness (n=2000). Trial 2, a comparative effectiveness trial, compares this clinician-facing Jumpstart with a bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart based on surveys completed by patients or family members (n=400). We hypothesize that the clinician-facing Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to usual care, and the bi-directional, patient- specific Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart. We use an innovative hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach to accomplish 3 aims. Aim 1 evaluates the effectiveness of the clinician-facing Jumpstart, compared with usual care, for improving quality of care; the primary outcome is EHR documentation of a goals-of-care discussion during the hospitalization. Secondary outcomes include intensity of care at the end of life. Aim 2 evaluates the effectiveness of the bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart; the primary outcome is the same as Trial 1. We will examine the same secondary outcomes, but also include patient- and family-reported outcomes assessed by surveys at 1 and 3 months after randomization including occurrence and quality of goals-of-care communication in the hospital, goal-concordant care, psychological symptoms, quality of life, and palliative care needs. We will also examine costs of care after accounting for costs of the interventions. In Aim 3, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation to explore barriers and facilitators to future implementation and dissemination.  Our team has experience conducting innovative multi-center trials with patient-centered outcomes, economic analyses, and implementation science. This novel hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach addresses key knowledge gaps to improve the quality and value of care for older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Communication about goals of care is one of the most important aspects of palliative care for older adults, yet the lack of this communication is a major shortcoming in our healthcare system.

"Sleep Health Profiles in Middle-aged Workers in Relation to Cardiovascular and Cognitive Health Middle-aged workers are vulnerable to having poor sleep, which is a public concern as it may lead to decreased productivity at work and increased risks of health problems over time. Most studies have associated one aspect of sleep (often focusing on sleep duration) with work or health-related variables, lacking a comprehensive understanding of how the combinations of multiple dimensions of sleep within individuals are associated with work-related stress and health outcomes. For example, a combination of sufficient sleep duration, regular sleep/wake, efficient sleep, and no insomnia symptom may be more predictive of concurrent and later cardiovascular and cognitive health than sleep duration alone. We propose to use multidimensional sleep health profiles that measure “which” and “how many” sleep problems co-occur within individuals. Harmonizing two independent project data sets from the Midlife in the United States Study (MIDUS) and Work, Family & Health Study (WFHS), the proposed study aims at examining the relationships between work-to-nonwork conflict (work stress carried over to and interfering with family and personal activities including sleep), sleep health profiles, and cardiovascular and cognitive health. Aim 1 will identify sleep health profiles in middle-aged workers and examine the associations of work-to-nonwork conflict with the sleep health profiles. Using extensive measures of self- reported and actigraphy-measured sleep, we will identify a priori-defined and empirically-derived sleep health profiles in diverse forms and will evaluate reproducibility of sleep health profiles across MIDUS and WFHS samples. Aim 2 will examine the associations of the sleep health profiles with cardiovascular health outcomes. Taking advantage of two cohorts in MIDUS that were sampled before and after the U.S. Great Recession period (2007-2009), we will also examine the health impacts of a macro- level stressor, whether those who were exposed to the economic recession exhibit a stronger link between sleep health profiles and cardiovascular outcomes than a propensity-matched sample who were not exposed to the recession but otherwise equal on all observables. Aim 3 will further examine the associations of the sleep health profiles with cognitive outcomes, leveraging MIDUS longitudinal cognitive data that include objectively measured episodic memory and executive functioning. We will also explore (1) whether sleep health profiles mediate the relationships between work-related stress (work-to-nonwork conflict) and cardiovascular and cognitive health, (2) potential moderation by sex and race, and (3) daily characteristics that predict optimal sleep health nights (using machine-learning). The proposed sleep health profiles can be broadly used to improve prediction accuracy in health screening tools. Focusing on middle-aged workers will contribute to decreasing health disparities in the workforce and promoting work productivity and healthy aging. Findings will inform the development of sleep-focused interventions to improve sleep and health among middle-aged workers who are in greater need. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of sleep health profiles among U.S. middle-aged workers is expected to increase understanding of how the combinations of multiple sleep characteristics relate to work-related stress and cardiovascular and cognitive health. The identified sleep health profile can be broadly used to improve prediction accuracy in health screening tools and can provide a basis for developing population-level sleep health interventions.

"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9879630,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,454065,0.1019244195124014
"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease, their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults with who are at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and the reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines.

"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9990638,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'care outcomes', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data archive', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'public health relevance', 'randomized controlled design', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2020,1744950,0.01619579242279408
"Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the aging population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including cerebrovascular injury. Repetitive exposure to acute CV response, such as sympathetic surge and blood pressure (BP) rise following obstructive respiratory events, is an important mediating mechanism linking OSA to CV disease and cerebrovascular injury. However, such acute CV responses are not effectively captured by conventional polysomnography metrics, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) commonly used in OSA evaluation. This results in imprecise classification of patients in terms of their CV risk and may be responsible for inconsistent results in epidemiologic and clinical studies. More importantly, the uncertainty of the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing the CV risk poses a significant challenge in therapeutic decision-making in older individuals. Therefore, the identification of additional phenotypic markers that better quantify the unfavorable CV effects of OSA and provide improved prediction of CV outcomes is crucial to improving risk stratification and clinical therapeutic decision-making. Herein, we propose to study novel physiologic measurements that can readily be retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether PPG features are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CV disease, and cerebrovascular injury. We will extract PPG features from polysomnography obtained in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study and examine whether PPG features are associated with CV outcomes, including left ventricular mass, aortic stiffness, and incident cardiovascular events, as well as markers of cerebrovascular injury, including brain structural abnormalities by MRI and cognitive impairment by Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument in the older men and women. We will compare the association of PPG features with these outcomes with that of conventional OSA assessment metrics (such as apnea hypopnea index). The main PPG feature of interest is slope transit time. To assess the utility of the various PPG features for use in estimating and classifying outcomes, we will use novel machine learning methods, such as are based on the GNOSIS (Generalized Networks for the Optimal Synthesis of Information Systems) information-theory-based modeling tool. Subsequently, we will determine how PPG features predict BP treatment response to CPAP and O2 therapy using data from the HeartBEAT randomized controlled trial. This study attempts to identify novel PSG metrics that are cardiovascular-centric and to assess their clinical utility in the older adults. The findings of the study will provide a basis for further development of a simpler method by which to assess and monitor OSA. Considering the high prevalence of OSA in older populations, coupled with its impact on adverse health outcomes, the proposal has significant public health implications. Project Narrative Currently used conventional metrics for sleep apnea assessment has many limitations including insufficient consideration of acute cardiovascular response to sleep apnea event. We propose to study a novel physiologic measurements that can be readily retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether they are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CVD and neurocognitive outcomes. We will use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to evaluate PPG features in their associations with outcomes and examine whether these features help identify people who respond better to CPAP therapy in terms of blood pressure in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) randomized controlled trial data.",Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep,10107688,R21AG070576,"['Acute', 'Apnea', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Heart', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Left Ventricular Mass', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Older Population', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'aging population', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'older men', 'older women', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2020,256550,0.04663814878184134
"Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of the proposed K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to provide the PI with the mentorship, theoretical knowledge, and research skills to develop into a fully independent psychophysiological researcher studying biomarkers of depression that can be used as targets for novel interventions. In consultation with her mentors, the PI has recruited a team of expert consultants to guide her in executing a research project and training plan that will provide experience essential to her goals.  The proposed study will be conducted at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry. The study focuses on late-life depression because it is prevalent and has negative outcomes. Existing treatments have low response rates and are rarely used correctly in the community due to their complexity. The project is based on the premise that focused treatments targeting biosignatures of specific neural abnormalities will have the greatest impact on clinical outcomes in late-life depression. It concentrates on positive valence systems, which are vulnerable to aging and often impaired in depression. The project will investigate positive valence systems in older adults with major depression receiving Engage, a psychotherapy designed to reactivate reward system functions. Engage has been found efficacious in late-life depression and easy to learn by community-based therapists. Consistent with RDoC methods, the proposed study will examine target engagement of Engage in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) during a 9-week course of Engage therapy, using three units of analysis to assess positive valence system function: physiology (event-related potentials), self-reports, and behavior. It will compare Engage-treated participants with 35 depressed participants, group-matched on age, receiving manualized supportive therapy. Additional analyses will assess whether low baseline positive valence function, or increases in positive valence function during treatment, predict improvement of anhedonia with Engage, and whether reward function mediates change in anhedonia.  The proposed training plan complements the research study with individualized tutorials, formal coursework, research collaborations, and manuscript preparation that will provide the PI with knowledge and skills in several areas: 1) Age-related neurobiological changes in the positive valence system and related networks; 2) Advanced statistical techniques to identify distinct neural abnormalities in depressed individuals based on their ERP profiles; and 3) Clinical trial design for psychotherapeutic interventions. The proposed project may provide important information about target engagement and mechanisms of a biologically informed, easily implemented treatment for late-life depression that has potential for dissemination. It will also provide pilot data for an R-series study using machine learning methods to predict response to Engage and will serve as an important stepping-stone for the PI as she prepares for an independent research career. Late-life depression is prevalent and devastating, and response rates to even the most effective treatments are low. Outcomes may be improved by developing targeted interventions such as Engage – a new, easily disseminated, neurobiologically informed psychotherapy for late-life depression designed to restore impaired function of the positive valence system. The proposed study will use event-related potentials and a panel of other positive valence system measures to assess target engagement in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) receiving Engage therapy, with a comparison group of 35 age-group-matched depressed peers receiving supportive therapy.",Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression,9941142,K23MH116105,"['Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuscripts', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positive Valence', 'Preparation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Stimulus', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Visual attention', 'age group', 'age related', 'base', 'biosignature', 'career', 'career development', 'comparison group', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'extrastriate', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning community', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'opioid user', 'peer', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'sustained attention', 'trait']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2020,190430,0.03161612857846827
"Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in older adults (≥65y) is rising, and there is limited evidence-based guidance on treating these older adults. In older patients with multi-morbidity, treatment decisions should factor in not only risk of disease complications, but also treatment complications and non-IBD, extra-intestinal complications. Hence, to inform optimal treatment approach, a comprehensive assessment of comparative effects of different therapies on all of these outcomes is warranted. Existing single-center observational studies are limited by small sample size, and missing data due to fragmented health care, whereas administrative claims-based studies are limited by lack of detailed clinical data; these limitations can be overcome by linking the two data sources. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Siddharth Singh proposes to: (Aim #1.1) characterize disease burden and treatment patterns, (Aim #1.2) assess and predict risks of death, disease, treatment and extra-intestinal complications using machine-learning algorithms and (Aim #2.1) compare overall effectiveness and (Aim #2.2) safety of different treatment strategies in older patients with IBD. This will be studied using a highly innovative informatics-based approach in a multi-site, electronic medical record (EMR)-based cohort of older patients with IBD, linked to their corresponding Medicare claims. The EMR-based cohort will facilitate phenotyping and disease severity assessment, and linkage to Medicare claims will augment exposure and outcome ascertainment, overcoming challenges of fragmentation of healthcare and short follow-up. The central hypothesis is that, that older adults have systematically different risk profiles than younger adults, and using biologic monotherapy is a safer and more effective approach to treating IBD, as compared to using long-term corticosteroids alone, non-biologic immunomodulator monotherapy, and combination therapy of biologics and immunomodulators. The access to the advanced infrastructure of pSCANNER (Patient-centered Scalable National Network for Effectiveness Research), one of 13 PCORI-funded Clinical Data Research Networks, and entire Medicare database, in a highly supportive and conducive environment at UCSD, with cross-disciplinary mentorship by a collaborative and experienced team of mentors and advisors from diverse backgrounds (clinical informatics, comparative effectiveness research, IBD therapeutics) is a key strength of this application. Besides directly informing clinical practice on treatment approaches in older patients with IBD, this proposal will enhance the career of the candidate by providing unique skills in applied clinical informatics, privacy-preserving record linkage techniques, predictive analytics, and comparative effectiveness research, and create a multi-institutional, EMR- based cohort of well-characterized IBD patients, linked with Medicare claims. This will ultimately contribute to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career focusing on comparative effectiveness research and population health management using novel informatics-based approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The information on comparative effectiveness and safety of different therapies in the context of patients' risk profile generated using this novel informatics-based approach in a unique linked EMR-Medicare database, will directly inform treatment of older patients with IBD, and enhance comparative effectiveness research methods.",Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,9919547,K23DK117058,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunomodulators', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Steroids', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Thromboembolism', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health management', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'privacy preservation', 'risk minimization', 'skills', 'treatment risk', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K23,2020,203990,0.05670231729779867
"Identifying Pathways Between Daily Stress and Long-Term Well-Being in Caregivers and Non-Caregivers Stressful experiences are generally thought to be harmful to mental and physical health. This perspective has guided research, informed policy, and colored the public narrative on the effects of caregiving for an impaired older adult. Indeed, many studies find greater depression, higher negative affect, and lower life satisfaction in caregivers (CGs) relative to non-caregivers (non-CGs).1,2 However, there is evidence that CGs experience positive effects despite, or perhaps because of, their stressful experiences.3 Research also finds that CGs live longer and are more resilient to perceived stress than non-CGs.4,5 Moreover, many CGs report psychological benefits like increased meaning in life, growing closer to the care recipient, and learning new skills.6,7 In a previous paper,8 the PI (Marino) suggested that these benefits reflect domains of eudaimonic well-being (EWB - meaning in life, positive relationships, personal growth, environmental mastery, autonomy, and self- acceptance) developed in positive psychology research9. Longitudinal change in EWB among CGs of impaired older adults has not yet been studied. Higher EWB has also been linked to lower reactivity to stressors,10,11 but has not been evaluated as an internal resource that promotes CGs' resilience to daily stress. The proposed project will fill these gaps by examining links between caregiving status and multiple dimensions of well-being including EWB, hedonic well-being (HWB - positive and negative affect and life satisfaction), and affective and physiological reactivity to daily stress. We will obtain a sample of propensity-matched CGs and non-CGs from the main survey of the population-based Midlife in the United States study and its daily diary study (the National Study of Daily Experiences) to identify within- and between- group differences in 1) EWB and HWB, cross- sectionally and over 20 years, and 2) exposure and reactivity to stressors over 8 days. In an exploratory aim, we will apply novel machine learning techniques to identify diverse conditions associated with typologies of optimal and sub-optimal well-being. The central hypothesis is that despite being associated with persistently lower HWB, caregiving for an impaired older adult is linked to greater increases in EWB over time. Further, longitudinal gains in EWB are predicted to weaken the association between stressor exposure and reactivity to daily stressors in CGs. The project is expected to help shift the current CG well-being paradigm by applying robust methods from developmental psychology to the caregiving context and generating novel information about how caring for an aging adult might affect well-being both negatively and positively, concurrently and over time. Findings can inform new psychological interventions that target EWB as a pathway to increasing resilience to daily stressors. The proposed training site will provide a scientific environment that is challenging and strongly supportive of the proposed project. Upon completion of the training plan, the PI will have a unique and diversified skill set for evaluating several domains of stress and well-being across time scales and will be prepared to lead future independent investigations to understand and promote positive outcomes among stress-prone adults like CGs. The proposed research will help identify both positive and negative effects of providing care to an impaired older adult and provide insight into caregivers' resilience to daily stressful experiences. As more adults become caregivers for an aging population, strategies are needed to optimize the short- and long-term effects of providing care. Thus, the proposed project is essential for the design of interventions that work towards NIA's mission of improving the health of older persons.",Identifying Pathways Between Daily Stress and Long-Term Well-Being in Caregivers and Non-Caregivers,10068660,F31AG066434,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver well-being', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic stress', 'Color', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disabled Children', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perception', 'Personal Growth', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Stress and Coping', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Typology', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'affective disturbance', 'aging population', 'care recipients', 'caregiving', 'caregiving outcomes', 'caregiving research', 'developmental psychology', 'diaries', 'experience', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'men', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'multilevel analysis', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'perceived stress', 'person centered', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'population survey', 'pre-doctoral', 'psychologic', 'research data dissemination', 'resilience', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'stressor', 'therapy design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,F31,2020,36231,0.040336000462670205
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,9906155,R01AG059729,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Diet', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Freedom', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Preparation', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'ST14 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'biracial', 'caucasian American', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'disability', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fitness', 'healthy aging', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'male', 'mental state', 'microbial', 'middle age', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sarcopenia', 'walking speed', 'young adult']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,611864,0.02294027440639492
"The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India Project Summary/Abstract Evidence demonstrates that sleep deprivation causes impaired cognitive function and is associated with impaired health (e.g. altered immune and cardiovascular function). Yet these conclusions largely derive from correlational relationships or studies of acute sleep deprivation lasting only a few days in sleep labs. Further, research on sleep in disadvantaged populations and sleep disparities is limited, despite severe environmental challenges to sleep among the poor. Moreover, the potentially bi-directional relationship between poor sleep and poor decision-making, a possible mediator of the income-health gradient, remains largely unexplored. In short, while poor sleep could be an important contributor to health disparities and accelerated aging, we know relatively little about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This K01 application will provide key training for career advancement and begin to close this gap in knowledge. To accomplish this goal, a randomized field experiment with 400 participants, each enrolled for over one month, in Chennai, India, will (1) objectively measure sleep and key environmental factors to provide preliminary evidence on the role of environmental causes of sleep deprivation in an urban environment, (2) rigorously evaluate two simple scalable interventions to reduce sleep deprivation among low-income adults in their natural environments, (3) estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision- making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, alcohol consumption), and earnings, and (4) utilizing questions regarding sleep asked of both RCT participants and a 50,000 person nationally-representative sample, estimate the extent of sleep deprivation and its impacts more broadly in urban India. The training aims underpinning the research aims and the applicant's long-term research goals are to expand knowledge and skills in: (1) cognitive psychology and the measurement of cognitive function, (2) aging, and (3) machine learning and predictive modeling. This training, accomplished through multiple avenues including coursework, directed study, and mentorship, will directly facilitate the proposed research and extend the scope and impact of the applicant's long-term research career studying health disparities and interactions between health and decision-making which may impact both cognitive and physical health as individuals age. Notably, while this application focuses on the impacts of sleep deprivation, the potential for health to shape decision-making is much broader. Constant exposure to other aspects of poor health associated with poverty, such as pain, also have the potential to exert a mental tax, leading to impaired cognition and poor decisions. Such a negative feedback loop between these factors and decision-making has the potential to further exacerbate health disparities. The far-reaching applicability of this idea beyond the direct scope of this proposal opens the door to high public-health significance through a wide variety of channels. Project narrative Although sleep has significant potential to impair cognition and impede health, relatively little is known about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This research will begin to close this gap in knowledge through a 400 person randomized trial in Chennai, India, which will objectively and rigorously measure sleep and key environmental factors impacting sleep, evaluate the impact of two simple and scalable interventions to improve sleep, and estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision-making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, tobacco consumption), and earnings. Providing rigorous evidence on these relationships and improving our collective understanding of the causes and costs to sleep deprivation, including not just direct health outcomes, but also shifts in preferences and decision-making directly relevant to health, will provide policy-relevant information important to improving health and healthy behaviors as well as promoting heathy and economically-secure aging.",The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India,9863981,K01AG055691,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Career Mobility', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Cost Measures', 'Decision Making', 'Developing Countries', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Economic Models', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impaired health', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Insecta', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolism', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Translating', 'adverse outcome', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure reduction', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cost', 'diarrheal disease', 'disadvantaged population', 'discount', 'econometrics', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'skills training', 'sleep health']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2020,127872,0.06178511820798691
"Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study ABSTRACT Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are all highly prevalent in the US population and are associated with significant morbidity, including poor mental health, impaired neurocognitive function, metabolic dysregulation, and cardiovascular disease. In the context of the high prevalence of pernicious sleep disturbances, there is evidence that sleep disparities exist in the population, such that racial/ethnic minorities – including Mexican-Americans – are at increased risk of sleep disturbances. This is alarming, since this group is also at increased risk for many of the adverse cardiometabolic and functional outcomes linked to sleep disturbances. These associations may be influenced by economic hardship, psychosocial stress, unhealthy behaviors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and smoking), and acculturation – the degree to which an individual adopts (in this case) traditional Mexican versus American culture. The first goal of this project is to examine sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep apnea severity among Mexican-Americans and examine the role of these social-behavioral factors in this relationship. Second, this study aims to examine the role of sleep and cardiometabolic disease risk in this population and explore the role of acculturation, psychosocial stress, economic hardship, and/or unhealthy behaviors in these associations. To accomplish this, this project will partner with the Mariposa Community Health Center, the federally qualified clinic in the Nogales, AZ area. Nogales is a small city on the US/Mexico border that is an ideal location for studying non-urban Mexican- Americans, as it is made up of 83% Hispanics/Latinos, 33% immigrants, and 77% who primarily speak Spanish at home. This community-engaged project will partner with Mariposa and their Platicamos Salud program that uses experienced Community Health Workers (promotoras de salud) to collect data and perform home visits. The study will recruit N=900 Mexican-Americans and N=200 Non-Hispanic Whites to complete a battery of assessments from a clinic visit (questionnaires, interviews, exam for anthropometry and arterial stiffness, and collection of biomarkers), a 1-night home sleep apnea assessment, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and a 2-week home monitoring period with sleep diary and actigraphy. This will result in a rich dataset that can help to identify and reduce sleep disparities in the population and point to potential intervention approaches to reducing cardiometabolic disease disparities. The analytic plan will take advantage of a machine-learning analytic approach, which will be used to evaluate the complex relationships among all of these variables. This project will address many relevant issues in sleep medicine, health disparities research, and border health. The partnership with Mariposa will enhance recruitment, promote research integrity (or ensure appropriateness of research methods), and facilitate dissemination of the study results into the community through education programs associated with Platicamos Salud and other community outreach efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The primary goal of this study is to assess sleep health among Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border, characterize relationships with cardiometabolic disease risk, and investigate the role of social-environmental factors including acculturation, stress, socioeconomics, and health behaviors. Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are highly prevalent in the population. These conditions are associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, daytime functioning problems, and poor mental health. Disparities in sleep health in racial/ethnic minorities exist, including Mexican-Americans.

"Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study ABSTRACT Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are all highly prevalent in the US population and are associated with significant morbidity, including poor mental health, impaired neurocognitive function, metabolic dysregulation, and cardiovascular disease. In the context of the high prevalence of pernicious sleep disturbances, there is evidence that sleep disparities exist in the population, such that racial/ethnic minorities – including Mexican-Americans – are at increased risk of sleep disturbances. This is alarming, since this group is also at increased risk for many of the adverse cardiometabolic and functional outcomes linked to sleep disturbances. These associations may be influenced by economic hardship, psychosocial stress, unhealthy behaviors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and smoking), and acculturation – the degree to which an individual adopts (in this case) traditional Mexican versus American culture. The first goal of this project is to examine sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep apnea severity among Mexican-Americans and examine the role of these social-behavioral factors in this relationship. Second, this study aims to examine the role of sleep and cardiometabolic disease risk in this population and explore the role of acculturation, psychosocial stress, economic hardship, and/or unhealthy behaviors in these associations. To accomplish this, this project will partner with the Mariposa Community Health Center, the federally qualified clinic in the Nogales, AZ area. Nogales is a small city on the US/Mexico border that is an ideal location for studying non-urban Mexican- Americans, as it is made up of 83% Hispanics/Latinos, 33% immigrants, and 77% who primarily speak Spanish at home. This community-engaged project will partner with Mariposa and their Platicamos Salud program that uses experienced Community Health Workers (promotoras de salud) to collect data and perform home visits. The study will recruit N=900 Mexican-Americans and N=200 Non-Hispanic Whites to complete a battery of assessments from a clinic visit (questionnaires, interviews, exam for anthropometry and arterial stiffness, and collection of biomarkers), a 1-night home sleep apnea assessment, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and a 2-week home monitoring period with sleep diary and actigraphy. This will result in a rich dataset that can help to identify and reduce sleep disparities in the population and point to potential intervention approaches to reducing cardiometabolic disease disparities. The analytic plan will take advantage of a machine-learning analytic approach, which will be used to evaluate the complex relationships among all of these variables. This project will address many relevant issues in sleep medicine, health disparities research, and border health. The partnership with Mariposa will enhance recruitment, promote research integrity (or ensure appropriateness of research methods), and facilitate dissemination of the study results into the community through education programs associated with Platicamos Salud and other community outreach efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The primary goal of this study is to assess sleep health among Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border, characterize relationships with cardiometabolic disease risk, and investigate the role of social-environmental factors including acculturation, stress, socioeconomics, and health behaviors. Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are highly prevalent in the population. These conditions are associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, daytime functioning problems, and poor mental health. Disparities in sleep health in racial/ethnic minorities exist, including Mexican-Americans. In particular, social-environmental factors at the US-Mexico border may play an important role in sleep health disparities. This project will not only allow for increased understanding of the complex relationship among sleep, health, and social-environmental pressures, but through a community partnership it can maximize our ability to reduce these disparities. Also, this project has the added benefit of providing information about the role of sleep as a potentially modifiable factor in cardiovascular disease and diabetes disparities as well.",Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study,9827495,R01MD011600,"['Acculturation', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Community Health Aides', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Hour', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Latino', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Metabolic', 'Mexican', 'Mexican Americans', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cardiometabolism', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'caucasian American', 'community partnership', 'diaries', 'diet and exercise', 'disorder risk', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'food security', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'low density lipoprotein triglyceride', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'perceived stress', 'pressure', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'sample collection', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep health', 'social', 'social factors', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2020,731043,0.05738016674926186
"Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are typically the result of neurodegenerative processes that begin 15-20 years before clinical diagnosis. Despite this lengthy subclinical phase and advances in early diagnostic technologies including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain MRIs, and positron emission tomography (PET) measures there are no scalable biomarkers to identify individuals with preclinical disease, which may offer the best time window for intervention. Specifically, because brain MRI and PET tests are resource-intensive and CSF sampling is invasive, there is urgent need for biomarkers based on blood samples, which can be non-invasively collected even in centers lacking highly specialized technology. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), unlike the stable nuclear genome, is dynamic and accumulates somatic mutations over the lifespan. Mutations in the mtDNA can be induced by oxidative stress and lead to declining mitochondrial function as we age; in turn, less functional mitochondria generate higher levels of oxidative stress, which induces chronic inflammation and tissue injury in specific organs including the brain. Yet, no study has investigated mtDNA mutations as early predictors of ADRD. We hypothesize that individuals with higher levels and faster accumulation of blood mtDNA mutations have greater cognitive decline and preclinical ADRD brain imaging changes during midlife, and that these mtDNA biomarkers will predict ADRD diagnosis in older adults. We will test our hypotheses by leveraging the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development In young Adults (CARDIA) study. CARDIA is a multicenter, community-based, longitudinal cohort that recruited 5,115 black and white young adults (mean age 25 years), followed them up at least every five years, and is preparing to conduct its examination Year 35 (Y35) visit in 2020/21 (mean age 60 years) when over 3,000 participants are expected to return. We will use state-of-the-art deep sequencing technology to measure mtDNA mutations in CARDIA blood samples collected at Y15, Y25, and Y35. In Aim 1, we will determine whether higher levels of mtDNA mutations and their accumulation over time are associated with greater cognitive decline in midlife. In Aim 2, we will determine whether mtDNA mutations are associated with structural, physiological, and functional MRI phenotypes of preclinical ADRD as well as with sensitive MRI-based markers of accelerated brain aging and preclinical ADRD constructed by our team using contemporary machine learning techniques. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the clinical utility of these mtDNA mutation biomarkers in identifying individuals at risk of future ADRD in four older cohorts that have large numbers of longitudinally identified, clinically-diagnosed ADRD. Our focus on longitudinal measures of blood mtDNA, cognitive function, and MRI changes over a 10- year period during midlife, combined with characterization of their clinical utility in older populations, is highly innovative. If successful, our study may help initiate possible future interventions in early midlife and reduce the public health and medical burden of AD and dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This study has high potential for characterizing novel blood-based biomarkers to identify preclinical ADRD and test their utility in predicting clinical ADRD. No other study has a similar design with repeated blood mtDNA mutations, cognitive assessments, and brain imaging data during midlife, a critical time window for interventions to prevent clinical ADRD development. By also using data from four large cohorts of older adults, we can determine the clinical utility of these mtDNA biomarkers to predict clinical ADRD and move the field closer toward the NIH’s goal of personalized health interventions.",Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study,10055446,R01AG069120,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nuclear', 'Older Population', 'Organ', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep sequencing', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'middle age', 'mitochondrial DNA mutation', 'mitochondrial genome', 'novel', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'tissue injury', 'tool', 'whole genome', 'young adult']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,852784,-0.014191482622840229
"Determinants of insufficient sleep among blacks and effects on disparities in health outcomes Project Summary Insufficient sleep (IS), stemming from sleep apnea, shift work, insomnia, working over 40 hr./week, unfavorable sleep environments and/or volitional reduction of bedtime, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) markers (elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and arterial stiffness), inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein) as well as with brain injury. Compelling evidence shows racial/ethnic disparities in insufficient sleep (IS), with blacks exhibiting a three-fold greater risk of IS relative to whites. Disparities might arise from physiologic and genetic factors, but recent evidence suggests environmental and psychosocial factors are also critical determinants. This study will utilize innovative dynamic modeling in a multi-level framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants (associative factors) of actigraphic IS and its putative associations with adverse health outcomes among blacks. Individual- and contextual-level data will be captured using novel home-based recordings and GIS data to model the environmental context where sleep occurs. The proposed study will leverage success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup led by Dr. Jean- Louis (PI), who has been conducting community-engaged sleep research for over 10 years. The workgroup comprises outstanding investigators with expertise in sleep and circadian rhythm, CVD, brain health, health disparities, translational behavioral medicine, and multi-level dynamic modeling. The study will benefit from experience of our standing Community Steering Committee, enabling recruitment of 560 blacks in various venues to participate in weeklong home studies to achieve proposed study aims. The multidisciplinary team will: 1) identify psychosocial (social support, discrimination, and attitudes/beliefs) and environmental (household [density, noise, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital, and neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with IS; ascertain effects of IS on (a) markers of CVD (obesity, BP, lipid profile, and glucose/ HbA1C) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) and on (b) markers of brain injury (tau, amyloid-β, neurofilament light, homocysteine, and glial fibrillary acidic protein; and develop profiles of blacks with IS-related adverse health outcomes using individual- and environmental-level data applying innovative multi-level dynamic modeling tools (Bayesia Belief Network and Agent-Based Simulation). This study will provide evidence to delineate factors underlying greater rates of IS among blacks and explain putative associations with markers of CVD, inflammation, and brain injury. These data will provide the foundation for longitudinal studies assessing causal effects of IS on these novel markers and interventions to mitigate adverse effects of IS on health outcomes. Project Narrative This proposal is predicated upon compelling data that blacks exhibit a three-fold greater risk of insufficient sleep (<7 hours) compared with whites, and that insufficient sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and brain injury. It will provide multi-level evidence on the impact of the psychosocial and environmental factors on insufficient sleep among blacks.

"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder.

This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,9984216,R01AG057679,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Big Data', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Demographic Transitions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Genealogy', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immigration', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Mission', 'Names', 'Neighborhoods', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Process', 'Public Policy', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Social Processes', 'Social Security', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Urbanization', 'War', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive capacity', 'cost effective', 'data curation', 'data integration', 'data quality', 'economic outcome', 'experience', 'health economics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'lead exposure', 'life history', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,675029,-0.0003934001384400128
"CRCNS: Unsupervised Learning of Hippocampal Sequence Dynamic in Sleep   In unit recordings from large populations of neurons, fast compressed sequential firing of neurons during rest and early sleep have been found to replay patterns first observed in active awake experience. These remarkable patterns have sparked widespread interest in the scientific community and beyond. Sequence  replay is now considered to play a critical role in the long-term stabilization and storage of mnemonically  important information. However, despite the general acknowledgement of the importance of the sequential structure, very little is known about the null background against which replay is compared. Specifically, are apparently 'non-replaying' spike patterns, as seen in late sleep, just simply noise? Because replay is typically assessed by comparison against a fixed known template, most methods can only determine whether the resemblance to the template is more than what might be expected from  random spike trains. But these methods cannot appraise whether other patterns remain in the nonsignificant events. Recently, the Diba and Kemere labs successfully collaborated to address precisely  this issue. We developed methods based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) to uncover temporal structure in spike trains of neurons in an unsupervised template-free manner. In this proposal, we aim to further improve these methods and to evaluate the hidden structure of spike trains in hippocampal  neuronal populations during sleep. In our second specific aim, we will use HMMs to determine both co-active ensemble (""contextual"") and temporal patterns (""sequential"") structure in hippocampal spike trains in both pre- and post-task sleep. In the third specific aim, we will probe the essence of sleep replay further, by exposing animals to multiple novel and familiar maze environments prior to long durations of sleep. In the fourth specific aim, we will perform closed-loop disruption of neuronal population patterns to  examine the causal interplay and reverberation of these patterns from early to late sleep. In summary, our  proposal is designed to provide strongest characterization to date of the structure of ""noise"" in replay events. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This study will provide an opening to evaluate the role of sleep in reorganizing information in the brain and  help to identify critical time windows and neuronal activities during sleep which are particularly important  for information storage and stabilization. Our assumptions and deductions about the nature and purpose  of sleep implicitly inform all manner of public policy, from the durations of shifts for hospital and relief  workers, to morning start times of public schools.

"Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality Abstract Older adults struggle to engage in health enhancing physical activity (PA) and spend up to 11 hours a day sitting. Older women, in particular, are at increased risk of chronic disease and disability, and use a high proportion of healthcare resources. Improving both these behaviors has promise for improving several salient aging outcomes, but evidence to inform guidelines on how best to interrupt long periods of sedentary behavior (SB) are lacking. Few laboratory-based trials have included adults over 70 years old, have focused on PA to interrupt SB, and have not tested standing breaks that might be acceptable to older adults. A recent review showed that in the real world, traditional PA interventions do not meaningfully impact SB. In contrast, interventions that focus on standing can reduce SB, up to 2 hours per day. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between self-reported SB and increased risks of death and metabolic outcomes, but very few prospective studies have employed objective measures of SB. Although accelerometer measures can indicate the intensity of movement or lack of it, traditional cutpoints do not accurately classify behaviors such as sitting, standing or walking. While pilot intervention studies, using thigh worn inclinometers, have demonstrated that SB can be greatly reduced, there are no RCTs in older adults with health outcomes. There is much room for improvement in our understanding of SB and healthy aging. The National Institute on Aging conducted a summer workshop series to address this issue in 2013. We have therefore designed a Program project – Sedentary Time and Aging Research (STAR) – to provide more rigorous and comprehensive evidence on how to interrupt sitting time and the consequences for healthy aging. In particular, we are proposing a paradigm shift away from energy expenditure as the primary mechanism for health outcomes to investigating behaviors such as brief sit-to-stand transitions that expend little energy but engage muscles, improve postural blood flow, and may impact physical functioning in older adults. Further, we will study a broader range of outcomes than investigated to date, including targeted novel mechanisms important for healthy aging. The STAR program will include 3 Projects and 2 Cores for study of postmenopausal women at risk for chronic disease. STAR includes 2 randomized trials, in the laboratory (N=86) and in the real world (N=592), with focus on optimizing new computational techniques to apply to existing prospective accelerometer data (n>6000). All projects will investigate the consequences of extended sitting, standing, brief sit-to-stand transitions and PA breaks on mechanisms of healthy aging including glucose regulation, endothelial functioning, and mitochondrial functioning. We will also investigate physical functioning, blood pressure and in Project 3, 5-7 year mortality risk. All Projects will compare effects across age groups. STAR will provide a comprehensive evidence base that can inform public health guidelines on SB and aging. We will coordinate our efforts with a new American Heart Association Center on SB and Latinas.  Narrative Sitting time may be particularly bad for the health of older women. This program grant will provide new and improved evidence to help the public understand how to interrupt sitting in ways that support healthy aging.  ","Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality",9949575,P01AG052352,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Computational Technique', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Endothelium', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Latina', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Postmenopause', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'age effect', 'age group', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'disability', 'emotional functioning', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'exercise intervention', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'older women', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'response biomarker', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P01,2020,1750278,0.06990346436444829
"Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment This project will develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) to provide cognitive training, in the form of learning to play the piano, to improve cognitive functioning and reduce feelings of loneliness in socially-isolated older adults. The SAR will administer cognitive training via guided practice on a set of standard piano lesson tasks designed to reflect particular cognitive functions: memory, attention, language, and social acuity. The goals of this project are that the SAR will (1) engage the persons with mild cognitive impairment (PMCI) in skill-building cognitive music training; (2) enhance cognitive functioning, in particular verbal and visual memory, reasoning ability, and complex attention; and (3) reduce feelings of loneliness. This SAR can be used as both a personalized social companion and an interactive tutor to deliver customized training for cognitive functioning and social engagement. We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, roboticists, engineers, human factors specialists, neuroscientists, and gerontologists, well suited to achieve goals. Dementia is a costly chronic disease; an estimated $259 billion was spent in 2017 for health care, long-term care, and out-of-pocket expenses. Furthermore, social isolation is a problem many older adults face, with 1 in 3 older adults reporting loneliness in the United States. Socially assistive robotics (SARs) have the potential to provide mental and social engagement – especially for those older adults who may lack social connections. In particular, SARs can utilize machine learning to provide customized and socially-engaging cognitive training for lonely older adults with MCI.",Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,9991722,R42AG060800,"['Adoption', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Esthetics', 'Face', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Loneliness', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Music', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Reporting', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Specialist', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Uninsured Medical Expense', 'United States', 'aged', 'body language', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive training', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'preference', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'robot assistance', 'robot interface', 'sensory integration', 'skills', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'social engagement', 'tutoring', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'visual memory', 'web app']",NIA,APPLIED UNIVERSAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION,R42,2020,1981401,0.04557344156759812
"Voice2Connect: Informing the Design of Smart Speakers for Social Connectedness in Low-Income Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract There is a growing public health concern regarding the high risk of social isolation and loneliness among low- income older adults and its resulting impact on their longevity and overall well-being. The issue of social isolation is particularly relevant to low-income senior housing (LISH) residents who often have multiple chronic conditions and disabilities, lack of financial and social resources, and limited social networks. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop innovative approaches to mitigate these issues in older adults living in LISH. Voice- operated smart speakers have the potential to reduce social isolation and loneliness in this population, for example, by connecting with other people, sending a reminder about social activities, or providing a conversational agent. The hands-free voice control provides improved accessibility and usability for people with low literacy, vision impairment, mobility limitation, or poor dexterity issues. We propose to examine how smart speakers can support the needs of social connectedness among older adults living alone in LISH. We will use an iterative user-centered design and employ a mixed-methods approach, incorporating participatory methods, focus group interviews, and functional and psychosocial health questionnaires. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to determine experiences of social isolation, user needs, user context, and preferences related to the use of smart speakers for social connectedness in the LISH setting, (2) to evaluate older adults (smart speaker users and non-users)’ and stakeholders’ attitudes towards the in-home use of smart speakers for promoting social engagement, with a focus on perceived usability and usefulness of the technology, and (3) to identify potential implementation barriers and privacy concerns among older adults and stakeholders. Stakeholders will include housing staff members (N=10) and health care professionals (N=6) providing wellness services to LISH residents. Older adults (N=36) will form six focus groups and take part in a series of three focus group sessions in which they participate in user-centered design activities to identify potential smart speaker features that can support the needs of social connectedness. Their thoughts and ideas will be used to develop low-fidelity prototypes and scenarios of use for each prototype. After prototype and scenario development, we will seek input from the older adults, housing staff, and health care providers through focus groups, which will be used to refine the prototype. The refined prototypes will be validated with the older adult participants. We will use a thematic analysis and inductive coding method to analyze focus group interview transcripts. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the questionnaire data collected from older adults and stakeholders. Findings from this study will inform our future research where we build smart speaker algorithms and functionalities that can facilitate the planning of innovative smart speaker-based social connectedness interventions for older adults in LISH. Project Narrative The proposed study aims to examine how smart speaker technologies can support the needs for social connectedness among older adults living alone in low-income senior housing communities. This study is highly relevant to public health as it represents an early exploration of what potential features and functionalities of smart speakers can address the issue of social isolation and loneliness in low-income senior housing residents.

"Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease A growing number of older patients are living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to advances in life- prolonging technologies and the aging of the population. As CKD advances towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD), even life-prolonging technologies cannot extend life indefinitely, especially for patients who have a poor prognosis and for whom decisions about medical interventions become particularly important. Consequently, older patients with advanced CKD need to communicate with their physicians about their preferences regarding CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care (medical management of symptoms of advanced CKD without dialysis) in order to make crucial decisions impacting the length and quality of their lives. Communication surrounding medical decision making is formalized in Advance Care Planning (ACP), a process involving verbal or written information designed to inform patients of possible medical options including CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care. Traditional ACP for patients with ESRD relies on ad hoc verbal descriptions of treatment options. This approach is limited because these options are difficult to envision. We have developed a video decision aid for reviewing CPR, dialysis and non-dialytic treatment preferences in ESRD. The tool, which is available in both English and Spanish, also allows patients to video record their preferences (""video declaration"") and share their preferences with their clinicians and caregivers. The overall objective of this study is to conduct a multi-center randomized trial of the video intervention (vs. usual care) to test the hypothesis that the video better informs older persons with advanced CKD and poor prognosis of their treatment options and leads to more ACP documentation, informed decision making, and improved quality of life. We will compare ACP documentation after one year (or at time of death) among 600 patients aged 75 or older with advanced CKD and poor prognosis randomly assigned to either the video intervention or usual care (Aim 1). We will compare ESRD treatment preferences, decisional conflict, ACP engagement and conversations, and concordance of preferences stated after the video intervention or usual care with ESRD care delivery after one year (or at time of death) (Aim 2). We will explore the quality of life, longevity, and cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) associated with patients' ESRD treatment decisions in the video vs. control groups (Aim 3). We will also conduct a qualitative assessment of the video declarations as well as barriers and facilitators for intervention success (Aims 4 and 5). ESRD in older patients involves complex decision making. It is imperative that we develop and evaluate early interventions to deliver more patient- focused care to this rapidly growing segment of the population. Using videos to enhance communication offers an opportunity to improve care of this vulnerable group of patients. Video is a practical, evidence-based, and innovative approach that has the potential to improve the quality of care provided to tens of thousands of older Americans. It is imperative to develop scalable and effective approaches to supporting persons with advanced kidney disease and their family caregivers. By providing video education tools to better inform persons making decisions about medical care and offering evidence-based options for kidney care, there is an opportunity to improve quality of life throughout the care trajectory.",Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease,9946617,R01AG066892,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Aging', 'American', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Documentation', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'End stage renal failure', 'Family Caregiver', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Supportive care', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'aged', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'literacy', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,2331112,0.025320577102171414
"SCH: INT: Inferring at home gait parameters of older adults using floor vibrations   The United States population is growing older. There is an urgent need for tools to better connect health professionals with their patients and perform at-home assessments in an automated fashion. The long-term goal of this proposal is to discover the knowledge necessary to enable an always-on, non-intrusive, non-wearable smart system for automated at-home gait parameter estimation using floor vibrations. To achieve this vision, the proposal has the objective of connecting health professionals with older adults living independently through a smart system that estimates gait parameters using floor vibration. The aims to achieve this goal are to 1) determine at-home gait parameters as a function of time and space; 2) establish a digital identifier of the older adult based on gait parameters; and 3) correlate changes in at-home gait parameters, after considering spatial-temporal correlations, with changes in the well-being of the resident. The proposed research will advance the state-of-the-art in engineering, physical therapy and public health by testing the following hypotheses: 1) Floor vibration is a viable means to automatically and continuously determine gait parameters; 2) For healthy individuals living in an independent at-home setting, gait parameters will be consistent based on location in the home, time of the day and day of the week; and 3) For patients recently discharged from the hospital, recovery will correlate with improvements in their gait parameters. The testing of the hypotheses will be performed through five tasks: 1) Develop an automated system to capture floor vibration and extract gait parameters; 2) Validate the system in laboratory setting; 3) Collect data at participant’s homes; 4) Test the hypothesis that at-home gait parameters are consistent with time and space; 5) Test the hypothesis that improvement in gait parameters correlates improvement in health status of recently discharged patients. This research will be pursued by a group of interdisciplinary researchers in engineering and physical therapy with the support of an experienced geriatric physician and will advance the knowledge in signal processing techniques, estimation and validation of at-home gait parameters and their uncertainty, and relationship between changes at-home gait parameters and changes in health status. The proposed activities will have a significant impact on older adult care, the research community and the next generation of researchers and engineers stemming from: 1) improved health of older adults and reduced health care cost by early intervening and thus decreasing the readmission rate; 2) increased scientific literacy and public engagement through benchmark problems, interdisciplinary seminars, new courses and outreach activities; 3) the training of diverse convergence researchers competent in solving interdisciplinary problems, including underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The proposed research aligns with the mission of National Institute of Aging by developing automated, non-intrusive, privacy-preserving at-home gait assessment tools based on floor vibrations to correlate changes of gait parameters with the health status of older adults. The outcomes of this project will enable health professionals to monitor the well-being of the older population and manage recovery paradigms thereby improving the health and well-being of older Americans.",SCH: INT: Inferring at home gait parameters of older adults using floor vibrations  ,10019453,R01AG067395,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Floor', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Professional', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical therapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'STEM field', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'privacy preservation', 'readmission rates', 'scientific literacy', 'signal processing', 'spatial relationship', 'stem', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2020,297989,0.05977548507510691
"Robust circuit computation in freely behaving animals. Project Summary/Abstract Sleep is necessary for all brain function and ultimately life. The core function by which sleep contributes to healthy cognition remains one of the great questions facing neuroscience. Recent theories point to powerful cellular rules, but these are controversial and have difficulty accounting for the effects of sleep in ethologically and developmentally diverse circumstances. We recently showed that cortical circuit dynamics are actively tuned to criticality, a computational regime that maximizes information processing. This regime is disrupted by changes in synaptic strength, such as those believed to typify waking experience. This raises the intriguing possibility that the core mechanism by which sleep benefits neural function is by restoring criticality. Our preliminary experiments support this hypothesis. The overall goal of this project is to develop a new framework for understanding the neural impact of sleep and experience at the level of network dynamics. We will continuously track 500-1000 single neurons in the brains of freely behaving animals for up to six months. We will track sleep, wake, behavior, and neural dynamics across the entire distribution of naturally occurring behavior. We will take advantage of this methodologically integrated approach to understand how circuits in the brain maintain the stable computation necessary for cognition and natural behavior on long time-scales. In Aim 1, we will test the relationship between specific classes of behavior and criticality in underlying networks. In Aim 2, we will test the impact of wake and sleep on criticality across the brain for the majority of an animal's lifetime. In Aim 3, we will use a modelling-based approach to establish the mechanisms of criticality in the intact brain. The results of this work will shed light on a long-standing gap in our knowledge of fundamental neurobiology. Given the increasingly recognized role of sleep in a vast number of brain-related disorders, an understanding of how sleep works will open the door to significant health-related progress in the future. This work directly advances the mission of the BRAIN Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Sleep is vitally important for brain function and survival, yet its core process remains one of the most poorly understood features of life. We will apply novel methods to reveal generalizable principles about the role of sleep/experience in shaping neural circuits in the brain. In the long term, our results will enhance an understanding of the contribution of sleep to healthy cognition and the mechanisms by which disrupted sleep worsens neurodegenerative and mental health disorders.",Robust circuit computation in freely behaving animals.,10053390,R01NS118442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Institutes', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Process', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive benefits', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'new technology', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'restoration', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,600000,0.004409343672139412
"Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging PROJECT SUMMARY Prevalent, morbid, and costly ($66 billion/year in 2007), incontinence is a major problem, especially for older adults, in whom the most common type is urgency incontinence (UUI). Generally ascribed to bladder spasms, UUI's actual causes are unknown, and therapy remains inadequate. Recent data suggest that one cause is poor bladder control by the brain. In our recent R01 we used biofeedback (BFB) as a probe to explore this. The exciting findings suggest that one `phenotype' of UUI in older adults seems to be caused by a breakdown in brain control, which can be restored by successful behavioral therapy, while another is refractory. Our proposed new study will explore this further by attempting to differentiate the mechanisms associated with disease and aging. The goal is to identify which brain mechanisms should be suppressed because they are contributing to or causing UUI, which should be enhanced because they are helping to compensate for UUI, and which should be ignored because they are incidental to aging and not related to UUI. Current data suggest that bladder control comprises 3 cerebral circuits that maintain continence by suppressing the voiding reflex in the midbrain. In our UUI phenotype that responded to BFB, the mechanism involved enhancing deactivation of the first brain circuit (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) which resulted in less activation of the second circuit (which includes the midcingulate cortex). In the phenotype that was resistant to BFB, no brain changes were seen. Yet, although we have an emerging picture of the brain's role in UUI, we have only rudimentary understanding of what is `normal', i.e. how the brain normally controls the bladder. More relevant, we do not know whether this control mechanism is the same across the lifespan, or if it changes owing to the impact of aging. Thus, our overall aim is to characterize continence control in both young and old people, and examine how changes due to bladder control failure differ in each age group. Our specific aims are to characterize normal voiding in the continent old and young in order to better understand and verify the working model and to use the comparison to older adults with UUI to understand the mechanism of brain failure in these individuals. To address these aims, we will conduct a detailed clinical and neuroimaging study to study 80 asymptomatic women and 80 UUI women, each group divided equally into young (18-45) and old (65+ years). The study will enable us to evaluate the changes in brain structure and function and to identify brain mechanisms involved in continence control, changes due to aging (both benign and contributory to UUI), and changes due to disease. The study will provide the comprehensive data on brain mechanisms involved in the normal continence mechanism in order to better corroborate our working model, understand the aging process, and assess targets for therapy. It will thereby enable scientists to develop novel and more effective new therapies based on the revolution in neuroscience—and more hope for UUI sufferers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Urge urinary incontinence is a common problem in older people which vastly reduces quality of life, yet the cause and mechanism of disease are not well understood. This study will characterize brain control of the bladder in young and old continent individuals and age-matched wet counterparts. This will expand our current knowledge of how the brain controls the bladder, better characterize the `ideal' mechanism and suggest ways in which we can better target treatment.",Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging,10050097,R01AG065288,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Biofeedback', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Control', 'Bladder Dysfunction', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Incidence', 'Incontinence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Micturition Reflex', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Premenopause', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Refractory', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Spasm', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Urge Incontinence', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Woman', 'age group', 'age related', 'aged', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'innovation', 'micturition urgency', 'mind control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,624134,0.036029314181884146
"Modernizing the Assessment of Financial Decision Making: Development and Evaluation of a Simulated Online Money Management Task in Older Adults The advent of digital finance and online money management (OMM) services has changed the ways in which we conduct everyday transactions. Based on my preliminary F32 survey findings, the number of older adults who use technology is drastically growing and the way they approach financial transactions is certainly changing. Given the increasing number of older adults and corresponding diseases of aging such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the vulnerability of older adults to financial exploitation, and the pervasiveness of financial decision making in everyday life, it is critical to be able to accurately examine financial decision making using objective, quantifiable, and ecologically valid tasks that are in keeping with the current trends. In 2016, an expert panel working for the US Social Security Administration found a gap between the current assessment of financial decision making and real-world financial performance. The current proposal seeks to bridge this gap by developing and applying simulation technology-based OMM task to assess financial decision making in individuals across the spectrum of cognitive aging. Accordingly, the first two aims (K99/Mentored phase) of the current proposal are to establish the reliability and validity of a novel, simulated OMM credit card statement review task in cognitively healthy older adults via psychometrically rigorous approaches. The third and fourth inferential aims (R00 phase) are to use: (i) a longitudinal strategy to track OMM over time and in relation to cognitive changes in cognitively healthy older adults, and (ii) a cross-sectional strategy to examine OMM in two clinical groups (mild AD and those judged as financially incapable by Adult Protective Services) versus healthy older adults. To accomplish these aims, I will develop advanced skills to supplement my strong neuropsychological training, by: 1) gaining expertise in developing and conducting functional assessments using state-of-the-art technology; 2) developing a deeper knowledge of psychometric measurement to optimize task design; and 3) enriching my conceptual understanding of financial decision making while learning how to incorporate neuroeconomic principles and metacognitive assessment in financial decision making measurement. I have assembled an excellent and well-rounded mentorship team consisting of a computer scientist, biostatistician, gerontologist, economist, and expert neuropsychologists. Overall, this K99/R00 proposal enables me to lay a foundation for an independent research career focused on using technology to accurately conceptualize financial decision making in cognitively diverse older adults, a goal that is in line with the NIA’s mission to improve “the health, well-being, and independence of adults as they age”. Older adults, a wealthy segment of the population, are known to exhibit compromised financial decision making especially in the context of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease. As the landscape of financial decision making has changed dramatically with rapid technological advances, there is a growing gap between the skills necessary for everyday financial decision making and the way it in which it is assessed clinically. Given the precipitous, ongoing and projected increase in the number of older adults and their use of technology, it is imperative to develop financial decision making measures that approximate real world functioning in the current technological culture that can inform clinical determination of financial decision making abilities, and shape public policies aimed at minimizing financial losses.",Modernizing the Assessment of Financial Decision Making: Development and Evaluation of a Simulated Online Money Management Task in Older Adults,9902295,K99AG062783,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Factor Analysis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Psychologist', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Policy', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Review Literature', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States Social Security Administration', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Writing', 'age related', 'alertness', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive task', 'design', 'digital', 'executive function', 'exhaustion', 'financial decision making', 'financial exploitation', 'financial literacy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'literacy', 'middle age', 'neuroeconomics', 'novel', 'online course', 'preservation', 'rate of change', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2020,132227,0.0824442236464832
"Real-time fMRI neurofeedback of large-scale network dynamics in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY The misuse of opioids, opioid addiction and overdose are a serious national public health crisis—the opioid epidemic—that despite increased scientific, clinical and government attention, continues to grow. Methadone is a generally effective treatment for opioid use disorder, however relapse rates remain high, and risk of overdose is greatest during relapse. There is a need for improved mechanistic understanding of the factors that contribute to opioid relapse to improve our understanding of opioid use disorder and its treatment. Using connectome-based methods (i.e., functional connectivity) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we recently identified a large-scale brain network that predicted opioid relapse from both resting and task states. Connectome-based methods enable data-driven characterization of whole brain networks related to behavior that might be better suited to describe complex clinical phenomena (e.g., opioid relapse). Building on prior work indicating the utility of real-time fMRI neurofeedback to test brain activation patterns related to specific functions and individual abilities to regulate these functions, the proposed project will use connectome-based neurofeedback to target patterns of functional connectivity within our recently identified “opioid abstinence network”. This information is critical to improve understanding of mechanisms of opioid relapse. Individuals on methadone will be randomized to receive either active (n=12) or sham (n=12) connectome-based neurofeedback at 3 weekly scanning sessions including feedback and transfer runs. Additional baseline and follow-up scans will include resting state and reward and cognitive task runs. Craving, negative affect and opioid use will be measured weekly and at 1-mo follow-up. Based on our pilot data, connectome-based feedback will be targeted at the opioid abstinence network and we hypothesize that increased connectivity in this network will be associated with improved clinical outcomes. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with reduced opioid use from baseline to follow-up scans (Aim 1a) and at 1-mo follow- up (Aim 1b). Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with increased opioid abstinence network connectivity in resting state (Aim 2a) and task (reward, cognitive) state (Aim 2b) versus sham feedback, as in our pilot work. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with greater improvements in clinical features of opioid use disorder (craving, negative affect) than sham feedback (Aim 3a) and that increased opioid abstinence network connectivity will correlate with these improvements (Aim 3b). Overall, this project tests a potentially transformative hypothesis relating large-scale brain network dynamics to outcomes in opioid use disorder, and tests a highly innovative method for real-time fMRI neurofeedback from the opioid abstinence network to improve clinical features of opioid use disorder. This project will provide unprecedented insight into the functional neurobiology of opioid relapse and more generally has the potential to transform existing real-time fMRI paradigms in addictions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project leverages advances in real-time fMRI neurofeedback and machine learning to test whether methadone-treated individuals with opioid use disorder can increase functional connectivity within an empirically-derived “opioid abstinence network” that has previously been identified to predict opioid relapse. This project will provide critical data and information to improve our understanding of opioid relapse and may transform existing real-time fMRI paradigms in addictions more generally.

"Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the future of healthcare availability and quality of services seems uncertain, at the same time advances in pervasive computing and intelligent embedded systems provides innovative strategies to meet these needs. One particular need which technology can help address is assessment and assistance with a person's functional performance. The long-term goal of this work is to develop technologies that will improve the independent functioning and quality of life of individuals with functional limitations (particularly individuals with ADRDs) and reduce their reliance on caregivers. The primary objective of this application is to develop a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and assistance with everyday activities. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach will be to collect and fuse multi-modal functional performance data from ambient sensors, mobile sensors, free text, and assessment apps (Aim 1). This fused “human behaviorome” will provide a basis, together with observation-based ground truth, for automated functional assessment and validation of each component technology, including the use of compensatory strategies, through in-person observation and through video recording of typical daily activities and strategies (Aim 2). Finally, using iterative, user-centered assessment of prompt-based assistance, we will evaluate the ability of activity segmentation and forecasting techniques to provide automated support for activity initiation and accurate completion of everyday activities (Aim 3). The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on functional health revealed within a person's everyday environment that have not been investigated in prior work. The results can also help to extend functional independence through real-time assistance, while the outcomes can assist family planning, provision of care, and design of real-world and lab-based measures of functional performance. This work is important because of the increasing number of older individuals experiencing cognitive and functional limitations due to chronic health conditions. Furthermore, they address the need for individuals to remain functionally independent as long as possible in their own homes, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and provide assistance with everyday activities for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings for functional health assessment and intervention. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline,10092007,R01AG065218,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Family Planning', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'health assessment', 'health care availability', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smart home']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,600384,0.011212349469134129
"Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects 70% of older adults and remains the leading cause of morbidity and mor- tality in the United States. Several new drugs have recently been approved for CVD, but not enough is known about their utilization, benefits and risks in frail older patients. Since conducting a clinical trial in frail older adults can be costly and impractical, there is a pressing need for innovative strategies to generate evidence on new CVD drugs in a timely manner. The objective of this application is to establish a near-real-time prospective monitoring program in Medicare data to evaluate the benefit of new CVD drugs for older adults with frailty. A prospective monitoring program seeks to find early effectiveness and safety signals of new drugs by updating the analysis at regular intervals as new Medicare data become available. The investigators will incorporate a novel claims-based frailty index into the monitoring program to generate timely evidence on disease-specific and patient-centered net benefit of new drugs by frailty status. The central hypothesis is that disease-specific benefit and net benefit are determined by a patient's degree of frailty. Disease-specific benefit will be evaluated using clinical trial endpoints of effectiveness (e.g., CVD events) and safety (e.g., bleeding), and net benefit in terms of the number of days alive and spent at home, or “home time”. To conduct this work, the investigators will analyze Medicare data on 6 new CVD drugs approved in 2011-2017: 3 anticoagulants vs warfarin for atrial fibrillation, 2 antiplatelets vs clopidogrel for atherosclerotic CVD, and an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor vs enalapril for systolic heart failure. The validity and reproducibility of the results will be enhanced through the linkage of a subset of Medicare data to electronic health records and a national survey to supplement clinical information, and external validation of the Medicare data analysis in 2 large commercial databases. In the next 4 years, the investigators will accomplish 3 specific aims: 1) evaluate the temporal trends and predictors of new CVD drug use in frail and non-frail older adults with CVD over 2011-2020; 2) determine disease-specific benefit (deaths, CVD and safety events) and net benefit (home time) of 6 new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies; 3) identify patient characteristics that can predict net benefit (home time) with new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies. This proposal's innovative approach, which combines near-real-time prospective monitor- ing, a claims-based frailty score, and the patient-centered outcome of home time, offers a readily scalable and feasible framework for comparative effectiveness and safety studies of newly approved medications. The impact of the proposed research is significant because timely evidence generated from real-world healthcare data can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new CVD drugs based on a patient's frailty and expected net benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to establish a prospective monitoring program for newly approved cardiovascular drugs for older adults with frailty in routine healthcare databases and identify predictors of benefit from the new drugs. This research is relevant to public health because the evidence generated from this work can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new cardiovascular drugs in older adults based on a patient's frailty level and expected net benefit.

"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI. The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years. One of our overarching goals is to achieve a highly useful 7T clinical utility, which requires high quality, robust, and consistent acquisitions. This could be a potentially exclusive (over other human MRI field strengths) application for 7T imaging.",High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression,9955317,R01MH111265,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Consultations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Edema', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Gliosis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heating', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'Work', 'absorption', 'affective disturbance', 'aging brain', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'follow-up', 'geriatric depression', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'radio frequency', 'recruit', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'vascular depression']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,611884,0.08713987921176702
"BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, and shingles lead to significant rates of illness, hospitalization, and death among older adults. In the United States, vaccination rates have been mostly unchanged for a decade with lower rates among racial and ethnic minority groups. New and scalable approaches are needed to address this important public health issue. Nudges are changes to the way choices are offered or information is framed that can have outsized effects on behavior. For example, default options are the path of least resistance and the action that takes place if no alternatives are selected. Active choice is a method that prompts a decision-making now, rather than waiting for stakeholders to recognize the need to make the decision on their own. Our groups at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Medicine) and the University of Washington (UW Medicine) have formed behavioral design teams embedded within the operations of our health systems and have demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, this scalable technology platform is an optimal environment to implement and deploy these types of nudges. In this study, we propose to design, test, and implemented personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target barriers among high-risk subgroups to improve vaccination rates. We will pilot this at two health systems and then implement a pragmatic trial at those health systems and sites in the VA Health System. In the R61 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine and UW Medicine. Aim 1: To use EHR data and analytical methods to identify high-risk groups of older adults with suboptimal vaccination rates for influenza, pneumococcal disease, and herpes zoster. Aim 2: To assess the feasibility of implementing different types of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target the identified groups to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 3: To pilot test ways to personalize promising nudges to clinicians and patients for improving vaccination among older adults. In the R33 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine, UW Medicine, and the VA Health System. Aim 1: To conduct a 12-month, multisite, cluster randomized, pragmatic trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients relative to control to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing disparities in vaccination rates related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic factors. Aim 3: To evaluate heterogeneity in treatment effect across clinician, patient, and practice characteristics to further tailor approaches in future intervention design. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many older adults are at risk of illness, hospitalization, and death from vaccine-preventable diseases. Moreover, there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in care with even lower vaccination rates among African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. In this study, we will use analytical methods to identify high-risk subgroups, test personalized nudges to address barriers among these groups, and then implement a pragmatic, multisite trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates among older adults and reduce disparities in care.",BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR,10050234,R61AG068945,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Asians', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Health Services', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Vendor', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Workload', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'ethnic minority population', 'health care disparity', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'multi-site trial', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'peer', 'personalized approach', 'pragmatic trial', 'prescription opioid', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'response', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'treatment effect']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2020,315340,0.06889665067641963
"Non-Invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation in Patients with Opioid Use Disorders Treatment of Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs) includes medications with effects on opioid receptors such as buprenorphine, but access is limited for many patients and others are opposed to treating addictions with medications that have opioid agonist properties. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that is more acceptable for many patients, and recent studies show it to be equivalent in efficacy. Initiation of treatment with long-acting naltrexone, however, requires a period of abstinence of about seven days during which time patients suffer from intense symptoms of withdrawal with a risk of relapse that can lead to overdose-related death. Opioids have an inhibitory effect on norepinephrine and the sympathetic nervous system, and many symptoms of withdrawal are driven by rebound activation of these systems. Dopaminergic systems in brain areas including ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) and medial prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate) play an important role in opioid addiction, craving and relapse, as do increases in inflammation. This project will assess a form of neuromodulation involving non-invasive electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve that may play a useful role during the period of opioid withdrawal before the initiation of long-term naltrexone treatment in blocking norepinephrine, sympathetic, and inflammatory responses and enhancing peripheral parasympathetic and central brain function in areas modulating drug craving (ventral striatum, anterior cingulate). Our preliminary data on the effects of non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) on stress response in traumatized human subjects and patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show that nVNS reliably blocks peripheral sympathetic and enhances parasympathetic function, reduces inflammatory responses (interleukin-6, or IL-6), and enhances central brain responses (anterior cingulate) to stress. We now propose to apply this technology to the treatment of patients with OUDs. Following verification using modelling and determination of optimal dosing parameters, we will use these parameters to assess effects of nVNS versus sham stimulation on opioid craving, peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and brain functional responses measured with High-Resolution Positron Emission Tomography (HR-PET) and radiolabeled water to videos of drug cues in recently treated patients with OUDs. Based on the outcome of this research, we will proceed to the UH3 phase, which will involve a randomized, sham-controlled trial of nVNS in patients with OUDs during the one to two week period of opioid withdrawal followed by assessment of craving, HR-PET imaging of both brain function and brain dopaminergic function, and assessment of peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular and inflammatory responses in conjunction with administration of nVNS or sham. We hypothesize that nVNS will reduce opioid craving and inflammatory, peripheral autonomic and cardiovascular responses and enhance brain responses (anterior cingulate function and dopamine function in ventral striatum), and promote successful conversion to long-acting naltrexone, in patients with OUDs. Opioid use disorders (OUDs) have been associated with a 4-fold increase in drug overdose deaths in the past decade, and current treatments including medications that block the opioid receptor require a withdrawal period during which time many patients relapse and tragically may overdose and die. This project will assess a new device, non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS), that does not require surgery or implantation, and that electrically stimulates the vagus nerve as it passes through the neck, dampening the sympathetic nervous system and modulating brain regions in a way that may help patients during the opioid withdrawal period and reduce relapse. Studying the effects of nVNS on opioid craving and brain and physiological responses in patients with OUDs has the potential to reduce relapse and save lives, as well as increase our knowledge of changes to the brain and physiology that underlie OUDs and successful response to treatment.",Non-Invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation in Patients with Opioid Use Disorders,9983431,UG3DA048502,"['Abstinence', 'Adverse reactions', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dopamine', 'Dose', 'Drug usage', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Family', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Imagery', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Naltrexone', 'Neck', 'Nerve', 'Norepinephrine', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Radiolabeled', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Validation', 'Vasomotor', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'addiction', 'analog', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'craving', 'drug craving', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'neuroregulation', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'overdose death', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'tomography', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'vasoconstriction']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,UG3,2020,739505,0.020564921374775228
"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9829517,R01AG057704,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Biogenesis', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Certificates', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hand', 'Handwriting', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Resources', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immigrant', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Maiden Name', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Minnesota', 'Minority Groups', 'Names', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Price', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Science', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Toxin', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data infrastructure', 'data resource', 'early-life nutrition', 'ethnic minority population', 'frontier', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'large scale data', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'population health', 'population survey', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'suicide rate']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,307227,0.010009847626514315
"A non-pharmacological multi-modal therapy to improve sleep and cognition and reduce mild cognitive impairment risk Summary Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare with non-pharmacological interventions that use the science of behavior change and new Internet of Things (IoT) devices to augment clinical treatment. When you go to the doctor of the future, instead of prescribing a drug, in many cases the doctor may prescribe a software intervention guiding the patient through a process of facilitated behavior change and environmental optimization. This software approach to healthcare addresses the high-priority of providing services to individuals with limited/no access to care and for addressing the public health issues of insomnia and conversion to Mild Cognitive Impairments (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). These diseases are thought to cost the US Healthcare system more than $400 billion/year, with another $400 billion/year cost to U.S. businesses in lost productivity, sick days, and accidents. In our Phase I, we were the first research group to show that non-phase locked auditory stimulation can improve next day performance on attention measures without adversely impacting sleep organization, quality, or total sleep time. Our acoustic intervention increased the percentage and intensity of slow-wave sleep (SWS), the stage of sleep with many regenerative properties and which typically decreases with age. We have additional preliminary evidence that this sound-based intervention, played at the right time and volume during sleep, can enhance next day memory performance. Due to the accumulating support demonstrating the role that sleep quality and SWS play in conversion to MCI and AD from imaging studies, longitudinal studies, and cognitive assessments, our intervention may address both the public health issue of poor sleep quality and AD. In our Phase II, we propose to further address insomnia and AD risk by integrating our deep sleep enhancement intervention and sound masking intervetinos with additional IoT devices, such as the FitBit, Apple Watch, and Oura Ring for more accurately measuring sleep and delivering sleep improvement enhancements, such as smart light bulbs to entrain and strengthen circadian rhythms, and Amazon's Alexa to deliver relaxation interventions and reminders to address compliance. The developed software will include a sleep diary with all relevant sleep statistics viewable by a trained therapist in the gold standard treatment for insomnia, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi). Displaying this data to the clinician can be used to deliver more personalized interventions and increase compliance with the treatment. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial on 65+ aged healthy individuals in an independent living facility that have symptoms for insomnia and compare our enhanced type of CBTi integrated with new IoT technology to typical CBTi and a passive control of sleep hygiene therapy. We hypothesize that our intervention is just as effective as the gold standard treatment for insomnia of CBTi as measured by sleep efficiency on a sleep diary (primary outcome). The system may also have the additional benefit of improving next day cognitive performance (secondary outcome), a meaningful indicator of cognitive decline and AD risk. Exploratory analyses further test the effects of the intervention on a neurodegeneration biomarker panel and additional cognitive performance measures. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop an improved multi-modal and non-pharmacological intervention to reduce conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and reduce Alzheimer's Disease (AD) risk in a 65+ population with symptoms of insomnia. We improve sleep, a known risk factor for cognitive decline, AD, and neurodegeneration biomarkers by combining acoustic deep sleep stimulation with Internet of Things device to augment the sleep environment and a system for improving cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) that leverages big-data. We will run a randomized clinical trial on 100 people over an 8- week period to validate this technology. The primary outcome is sleep efficiency measured on a sleep diary, the typical measure of insomnia in clinical settings. The secondary outcome is cognitive decline measures of memory, executive functioning, and attention. Exploratory measures are additional cognitive tasks and biomarkers that are sensitive to MCI and ADRD. A successful project would yield a new, non- addictive, cheap, and accessible intervention to address insomnia and reduce conversion to MCI / ADRD.",A non-pharmacological multi-modal therapy to improve sleep and cognition and reduce mild cognitive impairment risk,10010093,R44AG056250,"['Accidents', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Apple watch', 'Arizona', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Businesses', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Comorbid Insomnia', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data Display', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hypertension', 'Illness Days', 'Impaired cognition', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Study', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Noise', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Insomnia', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sales', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Solid', 'Sonication', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'abeta deposition', 'actigraphy', 'active method', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'beta amyloid pathology', 'biomarker panel', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'diaries', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'human old age (65+)', 'hypnotic', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improvement on sleep', 'intervention effect', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'post intervention', 'primary outcome', 'randomized placebo controlled trial', 'regenerative', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'sleep health', 'sleep quality', 'sleep regulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'standard care', 'statistics', 'tau Proteins']",NIA,"PROACTIVE LIFE, INC.",R44,2020,1243520,-0.014690370386704166
