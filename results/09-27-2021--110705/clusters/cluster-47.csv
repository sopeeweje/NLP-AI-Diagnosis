"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,9820438,K99MH118359,"['10 year old', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'artificial neural network', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'neural correlate', 'periadolescent', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'symptom cluster']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,157009,0.03514698006958721
"SCH: INT: Computational Tools for Avoidaint/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder  Intellectual Merit: This project will for the first time provide the fundamental tools to integrate unique multimodal data toward screening, diagnosis, and intervention in eating disorders, with an initial focus on children with ARFID and related developmental and health disorders. This work is critical for enriching the understanding of healthy development and for broadening the foundations of behavioral data science. ARFID ·motivates the development of new computer vision and data analysis tools critical for the analysis of multidimensional behavioral data. The main aims are: 1. Develop and user individualized and integrated continuous facial affect coding from videos to discern affective motivations for food avoidance, critical due to the unique sensory aspects of eating disorders, and resulting from active stimulation via friendly and carefully designed images/videos and real food presentation; 2. Use data analysis and machine learning to derive sensory profiles based on patterns of food consumption and preference from existing unique datasets of selective eaters; and 3. Translate the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 into the clinic and home to assess the capacity of these tools to define a threshold of clinically significant food avoidance, to detect change in acceptability of food with repeated presentations, and to examine and modify the accuracy of our food suggestion algorithms. Broader Impacts: The impact of this application comprises two broad domains. First is the derivation of processes, tools, and strategies to analyze very disparate data across multiple levels of analysis and to codify those strategies to inform similar future work, in particular incorporating automatic behavioral coding. Second is the exploitation of these tools to address questions about the emergence of healthy/unhealthy food selectivity across the lifespan, including recommendation delivery via apps and at-home recordings. The health impact of even partial success in this project is very broad and significant. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project via the 6-weeks summer research program at the Information Initiative at Duke, a center dedicated to the fundamentals of data science and its applications; via the co-Pl's research lab devoted to eating disorders; and via the Pl's project dedicated to training undergraduate students to address eating disorders of their friends via an anonymous app. Outreach and dissemination will follow the broad use of the developed app, both in the clinic and the general population, including the Pl's connections with low-income and under-represented bi-lingual preK. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening mental illnesses affecting the general population; -90% of individuals never receive treatment, in part due to lack of awareness and access. Individuals with eating disorders experience a diminished quality of life, high mental and physical illness comorbidities, and an existence marked by profound loneliness and isolation. Combining expertise in eating disorders with computer vision and machine learning, we bring for the first time data science to this health challenge.

"Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping ABSTRACT  Symptom-based classification approaches based on the DSM 5 are often not supported by epidemiological, genetic, and clinical neuroimaging research and may impede the advancement of interventions that target the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health disorders. A novel alternative to classifying psychopathology based on presenting clinical symptoms is to identify neurobiologically-informed biotypes. Individuals are clustered according to shared patterns of brain dysfunction using data-driven machine learning techniques to reveal the heterogeneous biological mechanisms that underlie comorbid disorders. Internalizing symptoms often first begin during development, suggesting that this is a critical period of vulnerability. Additionally, strong sex differences are found in anxiety and depressive symptoms, starting in adolescence. Thus, studies are needed that examine sex differences in the neurobiological mechanisms associated with internalizing symptoms during development. The purpose of the current study is to uncover the neurobiological heterogeneity associated with internalizing symptoms in youth. During the K99 phase, Aim 1 will use machine-learning techniques to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity among youth with anxiety and depressive disorders using multimodal neuroimaging data from a large community-based sample of over 1,200 youth studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; Training phase). We will test these heterogeneous patterns on a hold-out sample from the same cohort to examine the model’s validity (Validation phase). While the PNC provides an ideal dataset for developing a model, it does not have paradigms relevant to fear and anxiety that would allow us to identify important phenotypic differences between biotypes. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the generalizability of this model in an independent sample collected during the R00 phase, and further characterize these biotypes using pertinent measures related to error and reward processing. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate how sex differences in brain development associate with heterogeneous neural patterns in internalizing symptoms. Dr. Kaczkurkin’s long-term goal is to establish an independent research program where she will use advanced multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to study the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders in youth. This study will provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on the PNC database at the University of Pennsylvania to develop a well-validated model while also collecting a refined independent dataset, which will provide Dr. Kaczkurkin with the training and experience needed to transition to an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will provide critical knowledge regarding the neurobiological heterogeneity in youth with mood and anxiety disorders. A greater comprehension of how abnormalities in brain function give rise to these symptoms in adolescence is critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. Such knowledge would benefit public health by reducing the costs and burden of internalizing symptoms on the society at large. !",Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping,9705932,K99MH117274,"['Adolescence', 'Affective', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Atrophic', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Comprehension', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Phobias', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'critical period', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'male', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'programs', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'reward processing', 'supervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2019,11937,0.03333715329044319

"Toward Precision Medicine for Substance Use Disorders with Co-Occurring PTSD - A Machine Learning Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 20 years of empirical data document the individual and societal costs of co-occurring substance use disorders (SUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although evidence-based treatments are available for SUD+PTSD, the lack of methods or guidelines for personalized treatment recommendations represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Secondary analyses of existing treatment research datasets have the promise to identify cost-effective and noninvasive variables that represent predictors, moderators, mediators, mechanisms of action, and secondary effects in a way that can be easily replicated in research and expanded to the real world. Importantly, extant datasets provide an opportunity to develop and test innovative analytic approaches that leverage technological advances in computing power to: 1) develop precision medicine algorithms that can prognosticate and prescribe at the patient-level, 2) generate new hypotheses to guide future research on treatment development and dissemination, and 3) innovate existing methods that can be applied to solve related problems in the field. Accordingly, the proposed project will apply machine learning methodologies to the largest existing NIDA-funded multi-site clinical trial for SUD+PTSD in order to: Aim 1: Develop algorithms that can identify the probability of treatment response on both SUD and PTSD outcomes based on routinely collected intake data. Aim 2: Identify key variables associated with a significant increase or decrease in the treatment response probability. Aim 3: Assess the feasibility of providing data-driven, personalized prescriptions that fit patients to the treatment most likely to benefit them based on their individual profile. The proposed machine learning analyses will be developed by the applicant at the Anxiety and Health Behaviors Laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin, and evaluated at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), which houses the fastest academic supercomputer in the United States of America, and one of the most powerful systems in the world. Importantly, the algorithms (once developed) can be easily disseminated and do not require powerful hardware to execute. Therefore, the combination of advanced machine learning analyses and high-performance computing has the promise to provide methods and findings that can be expanded across extant datasets and future research projects to facilitate scientific discovery in the field of personalized medicine for addiction that: 1) goes beyond comparing mean response across treatments, and 2) that is otherwise not possible with traditional statistical methods. If successful, the project will support a strategy that represents a paradigm shift from one-size-fits-all recommendations derived from treatment comparisons in clinical trials, to a data-driven, precision medicine approach that prognosticates and prescribes at the patient level. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will apply machine learning methodologies to the largest existing NIDA-funded multi-site clinical trial for substance use disorders (SUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9687747,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2019,163943,-0.005409325619097932
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason for this is that most neuroimaging prediction studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple correlation relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, nonlinear relationships, or multi-site cross-validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with reference, and sparse regression can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, providing promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers and going beyond a descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain disease to individualized prediction. We will facilitate the translational biomarker identification by developing 3 novel data-driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment may affect covarying brain function and structure in mental disorder, by using different clinical measures as a reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction framework with aggregated feature selection techniques that is able to estimate clinical outcome more precisely, e.g., remission/relapse status of individual MDD patient after electroconvulsive treatment(ECT) using baseline brain imaging and demographic measures of 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep learning combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) or attention modules, to classify multiple groups of psychiatric disorders by incorporating dynamic functional measures. The proposed (Deep/Recurrent/Convolutional Neural Network, DNN/RNN/CNN) models will have enhanced interpretability that is able to trace back and discover the most predictive functional networks from input. All above proposed methods will be applied to big data containing both multimodal imaging and behavioral information (n~5000) pooled from existing studies, and our developed open-source toolboxes will be shared publicly. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, leading to earlier and more effective interventions, and laying the groundwork for a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep learning, supervised learning and functional dynamics, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, and to identify precise biomarkers that are able to predict clinical measures for new individuals and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting of a big data with imaging and behavioral info to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9818198,R01MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,399485,0.009325117960780272

The overarching research goal in this proposal is to develop computational strategies that account for the heterogeneity of mood disorders to improve the identification of treatment-response biomarkers. Response to pharmaceutical and behavioral antidepressant treatments is low, likely due to the symptomatic and etiological heterogeneity of depression whereby certain treatments may confer differential benefits for patients having particular symptom constellations. In the K99 phase, I will seek to improve prediction of individual antidepressant response using electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which elicits robust and rapid antidepressant effects, as the treatment model. I will use MRI and clinical data from patients undergoing ECT collected for the large the Global ECT-MRI Research Collaboration (GEMRIC). In Aim 1, I will use exploratory factor analysis to characterize latent symptom dimensions of the GEMRIC cohort before, during, and after ECT. The accuracy of predicting clinical outcomes along the recovered symptom dimensions will be compared to traditional means of evaluating response using the total score of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Pursuit of this aim will expand my understanding of clinical psychiatry and lay foundational knowledge for the independent aims. Aim 2 will expand my deep learning and multimodal neuroimaging skillsets as I develop novel deep learning architectures to fuse multimodal imaging features of GEMRIC participants to further improve predictions of treatment response and cognitive impairment following ECT. Rather than simply concatenating multimodal features together, deep network architectures will discover latent feature representations. The R00 phase will be a logical progression of the skill sets I develop in the mentored phase and expand on these lines of research. Aim 3 will draw from a collection of large-scale MRI datasets from patients with more broadly defined mood disorders to identify multimodal imaging markers associated with transdiagnostic symptom domains. Aim 4 uses treatment groups from aim 3, including patients undergoing ketamine, sleep deprivation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and pharmaceuticals, to explore the extent to which biomarkers of therapeutic response, defined along the transdiagnostic symptom dimensions identified in Aim 3, are shared across treatment groups. I anticipate that discrete categorizations of mood disorders artificially obscures discovery of treatment-response biomarkers. Fulfillment of these aims will simultaneously propel me to independence and yield important insight into the treatment of heterogeneous mood disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mood disorders including depression, bipolar, and post-traumatic stress disorder constitute the world's leading cause of disability and their burden is increasing. This proposal seeks to mitigate the burden of these related mood disorders by identifying patterns of brain structure and function indicative of a patient's likelihood of benefiting from various related interventions. This research has the potential to inform more personalized treatment strategies than are currently available and will likely further inform development of precision interventions targeting mood disorders.",Data-driven models of symptom heterogeneity to empower transdiagnostic multimodal biomarker discovery in mood disorders,9891890,K99MH119314,"['Anhedonia', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Etiology', 'Factor Analysis', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Ketamine', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleeplessness', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'antidepressant effect', 'anxious', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker identification', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'electric field', 'hippocampal morphometry', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'network architecture', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'skills', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2019,104909,0.02197310298152111

"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",9734801,R01DA048764,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'arm', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'non-compliance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2019,422197,-0.023846368073649392
"Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment Summary: The public health burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is immense and current approaches for selecting antidepressant treatment have had limited success. By some estimates, fewer than one in three MDD patients will respond to their prescribed antidepressant and the quest for a treatment that will work is typically characterized by a lengthy course of trial-and-error. The need to identify patient characteristics (biomarkers) that can be used to objectively select personalized antidepressant treatment is clear. Accordingly, large clinical studies like the NIMH-funded Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) study have collected massive amounts of baseline measures including those from various neuroimaging sources in the hope that some can be used to guide antidepressant treatment selection. These data bring with them many statistical challenges that have yet to be effectively addressed. These challenges include (1) dealing with high-dimensionality, (2) handling data missingness, and (3) determining how best to simultaneously model relationships between measures from multiple imaging modalities and the response of interest. The goal of this project is to acquire the essential training and experience to make significant progress in this area by addressing each of these challenges. Aim 1 of this project will employ state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning algorithms and targeted estimation to identify moderators of antidepressant treatment effect using scalar clinical, demographic, and summary neuroimaging data from clinical trials of antidepressant treatments, including EMBARC. Strategies for handling missing data in this context will also be investigated and guidelines on best practices will be proposed. Aim 2 will extend the methods used in Aim 1 and develop user-friendly software to directly incorporate high- dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data into treatment decision rules. Included in this aim will be an investigation into best practices for handling missing high-dimensional imaging data in the context of estimating treatment decision rules. Aim 3 will employ the novel methods developed in Aim 2 and the estimated treatment decision rules will be evaluated and compared with those developed in Aim 1. I have put together a training program that directly supports the completion of these research aims. It includes instruction, mentoring, and hands-on-experience (1) in psychopathology and the neural basis for psychiatric disorders and treatment for those disorders; (2) in the use of neuroimaging data to understand depression and response to antidepressant treatment; (3) in the use of modern algorithms to store, process, manipulate, and analyze big biomedical data like those arising in multimodal neuroimaging studies. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the training, time, and resources to be able to make substantial progress in addressing this important problem and will provide the skills and experience that will be crucial in my transition to an independent investigator. Public Health Relevance Statement: This proposal seeks to advance precision medicine through the development of new statistical methods that integrate clinical, demographic, and high-dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data to estimate treatment decision rules. The proposed research and training are laid out in the context of depression but the statistical tools to be developed will be general enough for constructing treatment decision rules for a wide array of diseases using a variety of data types. These statistical tools have the potential to reduce the burden of diseases like depression by providing personalized treatment that has the best chance for success.",Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment,9785626,K01MH113850,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sertraline', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'Writing', 'big biomedical data', 'biosignature', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,158696,0.008920023846705516
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders.

"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,9681505,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2019,584268,0.03138919056906619
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

"Measuring the role of mental model complexity on individual behavioral and neural differences in adaptive decision making PROJECT SUMMARY To make good decisions in uncertain environments, humans build and update ‘mental models’ of relevant environmental statistics that can be used to make predictions and guide decision-making. When the environment changes, these models need to be adaptable to retain their predictiveness. This kind of adaptability typically involves key information-processing trade-offs that are well understood theoretically but have yet to be applied substantially to our understanding of human brain function and behavior. Here I examine systematically how these trade-offs, measured both from behavior and brain-imaging data, relate to the considerable variability in decision-making abilities that are typically evident across subjects and task conditions. My focus on behavioral, computational, and neural mechanisms of individual variability in decision-making abilities is particularly relevant to long-term research in mental health. Decision-making is severely disrupted in a number of mental illnesses including anxiety, schizophrenia, and addictive behaviors, but the exact mechanisms underlying these disruptions have yet to be fully elucidated. My central hypothesis is that individual and task-dependent differences in adaptive decision-making reflect systematic variability in the complexity of the mental models upon which the decisions are based. In the fields of statistics and machine learning, predictive models compress past observations into representations that can generalize to the future. A model’s complexity determines the flexibility with which this compression can account for new information. Complex models are more adaptive (low bias) but can overfit spurious observations, leading to more behavioral variability. In contrast, simpler models tend to have higher bias but lower variability. This tradeoff between bias and variance is well described in statistics and machine learning, but its influence on human mental models and decision-making behavior is not well known. The two primary aims of this project are: 1) to develop a principled measure of mental complexity that can be applied to human behavioral data; and 2) to identify the influence of mental model complexity on neuromodulatory brain networks involved in the mental exploration required for adaptive decision-making, and how activity in these networks differs across individuals. By linking a strong theoretical framework with methods from information theory, psychology, neuroscience, and computational modeling, the current proposal will provide a novel lens with which to examine behavioral and neurobiological sources of individual variability in human decision-making. Moreover, the results of this research will provide crucial insights for interventions aimed at understanding and improving decision-making processes affected by mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the importance of adaptive behavior in our everyday lives, there are substantial gaps in our understanding of why adaptive processes differ between healthy individuals and how mental illnesses disrupt these processes. I propose that the ‘complexity’ of the mental models people use to interact with an environment accounts for many of these individual differences, with more complex mental models leading to ‘overthinking’ while learning, whereas less complex models to ‘oversimplify’ what needs to be learned. The goals of this study are to test the novel hypothesis that mental model complexity accounts for substantial individual differences in adaptive learning, and identify the neuromodulatory brain networks underlying these differences.",Measuring the role of mental model complexity on individual behavioral and neural differences in adaptive decision making,9758624,F32MH117924,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Information Theory', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training Programs', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'career', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'information processing', 'insight', 'lens', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'norepinephrine system', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F32,2019,61226,-0.008810911001951091
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,9683972,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,735621,0.02818456718916593
"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief.

"Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes Project Summary Motor vehicle crashes lead causes of adolescent mortality, making this a major health threat facing US adolescents. Given that 95.6% of novice driver crashes are due to driver error, improved skill should reduce crash incidence. Research supports this: novice driver crash rates peak immediately following licensure and decline steeply with experience gained over the months following licensure. However, it is not known which critical driving skill deficits present at licensure predict crashes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop interventions prior to licensure that can lead to the safest independent driving post licensure. With this R21 project, we will identify deficits in driving skills that are (a) associated with major predictors of early crash risk (age at licensure and sex) and that (b) can predict differences in crash rates within the first year of independent licensure. We will leverage our exclusive access to an innovative, newly available data source for young driver research. To enable study of safety critical driving skill deficits in novice drivers, results from a new (as of July 2017) virtual driving test (VDT) - developed by the PI, adopted by the State of Ohio and delivered immediately prior to the on-road licensing examination - will be linked to Ohio licensing and crash data. We propose these aims: Aim 1: identify skill clusters using multivariate clustering, regression and machine learning techniques to test the hypothesis that these clusters are related to age at licensure, sex, and time spent in the learner period; Aim 2a: use data on driving skills linked with reported crash data in Ohio to determine whether the skill clusters identified in Aim 1 are associated with crash risk; and Aim 2b: determine if those skill clusters from Aim1 are predictive of crashes in rural teen drivers. With a large sample of new driver applicants (>25,000), this study will examine, for the first time, differences in skill, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will create a normative dataset of novice driver skills; classify skill deficits by age, sex and time in learner period; and quantify the relationship between skill deficits and crash rates during the first 2 months of licensure (when crash rates are highest for young drivers) and the following 10 months as experience accumulates. If the use of the VDT proves successful in predicting crash risk, we will be able to identify novice drivers with elevated crash risk before granting a license. This R21 will enable the following lines of research: (1) Develop new interventions that address skill deficits through training, individualized to the needs of the novice driver (in partnership with Ohio). (2) Develop or adapt advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or self-driving vehicle technology to mitigate identified skill deficits (as part of Dr. Winston’s National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center). (3) Conduct a prospective study (R01) of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk. Narrative We will identify safety-critical driving skill deficits immediately prior to licensure that predict crashes, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will leverage exclusive access to newly available data on >25,000 novice drivers: state licensing and crash data linked to results from a new (as of July 2017), well-validated virtual driving test that identifies driving skill deficits (adopted by Ohio). If this R21 finds the VDT successful in predicting crash risk, we plan to: (1) conduct a future study of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk and (2) develop new interventions (training and vehicle technology) to address this risk.","Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes",9808966,R21HD099635,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industry', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Licensure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Police', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vehicle crash', 'Young driver', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'design', 'driving skills', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prospective', 'safety study', 'sex', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suburb', 'virtual']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2019,294653,-0.004424146023375198
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9741540,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,459850,0.0037277197102879543
"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,9986132,R00MH110570,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'teacher', 'time use', 'treatment response']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,249000,0.0013410659951886763
"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality. Rates of depression begin to rise rapidly in early-mid adolescence and peak in early adulthood. This project seeks to identify early antecedents and risk factors for the onset of depressive disorders and to understand the processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically signficant psychopathology.

"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9903905,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Appalachia', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'sociodemographics', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2019,418818,-0.02868591116949783
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9717282,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2019,670982,0.02114315413261179
"Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies. Project Summary:  Mental disorders represent immense healthcare burdens. Intense efforts and resources have been devoted to developing pharmacological and behavioral treatments for mental disorders, but no universally effective treatments are available. Considerable heterogeneity exists in treatment response among individuals with mental disorders, in part because an individual patient's psychosocial characteristics and/or biomarkers are not accounted for when selecting among available treatment options. Barriers to implement personalized treatments in clinical psychiatry include a lack of evidence-based, clinically interpretable, individualized treatment rules (ITRs), a lack of power to detect treatment modifiers from a single study, and a lack of reproducibility for treatment rules estimated from single studies. We propose analytic solutions to tackle these barriers. Specifically, we will provide integrative machine learning methods to build powerful, yet interpretable, individualized treatment strategies that can be easily applied in clinical practice. We will integrate evidence of ITRs identified in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to increase robustness and reproducibility. In Aim 1, we will provide piece-wise linear decision trees that are  transparent, interpretable, and that have guaranteed performance. Our decision trees will simultaneously identify the optimal treatment for a given patient (qualitative interaction) and subgroups of patients with large benefit  (quantitative interaction). In Aim 2, we propose a novel integrative analysis to synthesize evidence across trials and provide an integrative ITR that improves efficiency and reproducibility. Our method does not require all studies to collect common sets of variables and thus allows evidence to be combined from ITRs identified in recent RCTs that collected emerging biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging measures) with earlier RCTs that focused on clinical and  behavioral markers. In response to the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to center mental health research around “dimensional psychological constructs” shared across disorders, the methods will be applied to a wide range of RCTs that recruited patients with major depressive disorder and other co-morbid mental disorders. This strategy allows examination of ITRs for constructs shared across disorders and will increase generalizability. We will apply our methods to various RCTs, including data available from the  National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness. This research will bridge approaches for personalized medicine and integrative analysis in an effort to better understand the complex interplay between biomarkers and clinical manifestations in the context of selecting the best treatments for patients with mental disorders. Project Narrative:  Treatment responses for mental disorders are inadequate and considerable heterogeneity is observed, in part because an individual patient's clinical, psychosocial, and/or biological markers are not accounted for when select- ing treatments among available options. This research proposes novel analytic methods to discover new powerful, yet interpretable personalized treatment strategies and integrate evidence of strategies identified in multiple prior studies to increase robustness and reproducibility.",Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies.,9774303,R21MH117458,"['Age', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bulimia', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Psychiatry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'analytical method', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical practice', 'demographics', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'mental health center', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sex', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2019,243000,0.03123758525444462
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders Project Summary/Abstract Substance use costs society $740 billion dollars each year, placing an enormous burden on our nation’s health care and criminal justice systems. Approximately 85% of incarcerated offenders in the United States have a history of substance use and/or are imprisoned for crimes involving or motivated by alcohol and/or drug use. Incarcerated individuals tend to show poorer outcomes following substance use treatment, and forced abstinence via imprisonment is associated with risk for future substance use, which likely contributes to substance-related antisocial behavior following imprisonment. Over the past few decades, women have been sentenced to prison for drug-related reasons at alarming rates, with a growth rate exceeding that for men. Further, women offenders tend to be impacted more heavily by substance use with co-morbid psychopathology, placing greater demands on the system in terms of substance use and mental health treatments. Using the world’s largest forensic neuroimaging database on women offenders (SWANC-F), this proposal investigates substance use and related antisocial behavior following release from prison in a large sample of women offenders, with a focus on neurobiological mechanisms, to demonstrate the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women. Substance-related antisocial behavior, defined as committing crime(s) related to substance use after release from prison, will be obtained from re-arrest data in institutional files and comprehensive background checks on all women enrolled in the study. A random sample (n = 100) will then be followed-up with via phone to gather data on substance use and obtain supplemental information to corroborate re-arrest data from files and background checks. Employing regression analyses and machine learning/pattern classifier approaches, models will be compared testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic variables, along with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) brain measures, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes of interest in women. Specifically, this proposal seeks to test the extent to which psychiatric and socioeconomic factors confer risk for substance-related antisocial behavior following release from prison in women (Aim 1), and integrates and compares the utility of rsFC brain measures in improving these prediction models (Aim 2). Then, similar methods will be applied to test the prediction of substance use following release from prison (Aim 3). It is expected that psychiatric risk factors and socioeconomic protective factors, as well as rsFC brain measures, will be useful in predicting substance use and related antisocial behavior following incarceration, along with time elapsed between release from prison and initiation of substance use and related behavior. Testing factors that aid in predicting these behaviors in women has the potential to be far-reaching by informing the development of targeted treatments, including those that help to account for sex differences and co-morbid conditions related to substance use. Project Narrative Women represent one of the fastest growing segments of substance users in the United States, with a growth rate of substance-related offending exceeding that of men; however, women continue to be one of the most underserved populations in substance use research. This proposal will compare statistical models testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic factors, along with resting-state functional connectivity in and between cognitive control, decision-making, and reward-processing neural circuitry, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes in women. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women in an effort to help inform future treatment efforts.","Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders",9758947,F31DA047048,"['4-aminospiroperidol', 'Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fibrinogen', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prisons', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offender', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'psychopathic personality', 'reward processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2019,35547,0.02198999365528118
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,9614335,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discount', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,684196,0.024296254315233325
"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This large-scale study will advance the field by studying these different outcomes at their most basic functional level, and by identifying the biological mechanisms through which these specific types of distress and dysfunction develop.",Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes,9756462,U01MH110925,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Department evaluation', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychophysics', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'biobehavior', 'clinical decision support', 'design', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'molecular marker', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'success', 'tool', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2019,5432897,-0.004199366424385127
"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9644557,R01MH059929,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Exposure to', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'clinical imaging', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'information processing', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'pre-clinical', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'symptomatology', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,638179,0.02889154179422641
"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,9600712,R01MH112829,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diffusion', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Telemedicine', 'Telemental', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care costs', 'contextual factors', 'control trial', 'demographics', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'experience', 'geographic difference', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'older patient', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'rapid growth', 'rural area', 'severe mental illness', 'symposium', 'trend', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,734746,0.03295520804776183
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology.

"Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support PROJECT SUMMARY Treatments for mental health conditions such as unipolar depression provide modest average benefit but have wide variation between individuals and within individuals over time. Evidence-based customized treatment protocols would improve the mental health care of many people by providing treatment recommendations for individuals that take into account potential variation because of personal characteristics such as current health status, symptoms, and response to earlier treatment. Generating customized treatment protocols requires large amounts of data, such as from networks of health systems that can link electronic health records from millions of individuals. Current statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols are limited in three important ways.  First, current approaches rely on scientists to select the patient characteristics to use to customize treatments instead of using data to find the patient characteristics that will lead to improved, customized care. Second, customized treatment protocols discovered with current statistical methods assume no unobserved differences between individuals who receive various treatment options. Third, investigators do not have ways to know if the available data contain enough information to discover and compare customized treatment protocols precisely enough to make clinical decisions. We will address these three limitations by developing new statistical tools for discovering customized treatment protocols using electronic health records data. Our research team has expertise and experience in statistics, epidemiology, and mental health care. We will integrate methods that have been successfully used in other settings to improve statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols and address these three important limitations.  We will extend machine learning tools for selecting important pieces of information to the time-varying data structure required for discovering customized treatment protocols. We will build approaches that use available knowledge about the size of unobserved differences between groups of people who received different treatments to assess how those differences change study results. By building on the math used to estimate the sample sizes needed for precision in randomized trials with complex designs, we will develop new formulas for determining how many people with a particular condition and who took a particular drug are needed in a health system to provide enough accurate information to discover customized treatment protocols.  Using data from the electronic health records of more than 15,000 patients, we will discover customized treatment protocols for depression. By improving statistical tools and addressing current limitations, our customized treatment protocols will have immediate impact for people living with unipolar depression. The statistical tools we develop will also be useful for discovering customized treatment protocols for people with a wide variety of mental health conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with mental health conditions and their health care providers often lack evidence for making choices about numerous treatment options and they do not have evidence-based, customized treatment plans. This project will develop customized treatment plans for unipolar depression and methods to generate these plans using data from electronic health care records. This work will address current limitations in statistical methods for selecting patient characteristics for customizing treatment, assessing bias from differences between people who take different medications, and calculating how many people are needed to accurately compare customized treatment plans using data from electronic health records.",Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support,9731644,R01MH114873,"['13 year old', 'Address', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'novel', 'practice setting', 'precision medicine', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,374957,-0.0030659733199937113
"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",9806002,K08MH120341,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Partnership Practice', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Services', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'chatbot', 'computer program', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health service use', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'service delivery', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'success', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web site']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2019,179096,0.02707036466918568
"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,9840077,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,621348,-0.012560320053344311
"Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis Dr. Hwanhee Hong is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development. Dr. Hong will also use all available resources from other Departments including biostatistics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. This environment maximizes the potential for Dr. Hong to obtain the necessary training and perform the research to establish herself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program. This project will help mental health researchers generalize, apply, and implement findings from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials to target populations. Traditional meta-analyses enable us to borrow strength across multiple studies to gain more power, resulting in reliable and precise effect estimates; however they do not consider how well the trials represent target populations of interest. By developing methods to help generalize the results of meta-analyses, we will help translate results into appropriate decisions regarding broad implementation and clinical practice.",Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis,9769134,R00MH111807,"['Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data access', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'informal learning', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open data', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'regression trees', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'working group']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,248999,0.003792713739766607
"Distributed networks underlying depression in epilepsy: a computational circuit-based approach to biomarker development PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Adult patients with epilepsy have an increased prevalence of major depression and other psychiatric co- morbidities. Depression in epilepsy is associated with worse outcome and quality of life. However, it continues to be underdiagnosed and untreated and further attention to this comorbidity is critical. My career goal is to become an academic neuroscientist and clinician focused on understanding the neural networks underlying co- morbid mood and anxiety spectrum disorders in patients with epilepsy.  Specific brain circuits may underlie depression and be commonly affected by different precipitants (i.e. stress, inflammation, epilepsy). In this proposal, our model is that a set of neural features across these brain circuits will be shared across many patients with co-morbid depression. Evidence for a strong relationship between epilepsy and depression includes the presence of depression symptoms before, during, after, and in between seizures, evidence of cases of concurrent onset of depression and epilepsy, an increased incidence of interictal depression when limbic structures are involved in seizure occurrence, and evidence that depression scores may be lower after surgical resection for medication refractory epilepsy. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) captured during the pre-surgical recording period offers a particularly promising method to study depression networks in adult epilepsy, offering both high temporal resolution and spatial precision. Despite the enormous potential of iEEG, there are no studies to date that examine the neurophysiological signatures of network dysfunction in mood and anxiety disorders in patients with epilepsy. Such studies are critical in order to better understand the etiology of co-morbid depression and could lead to novel personalized therapies.  In our pilot work, we identify a set of power spectral measures within a corticolimbic circuit that appear to be linked to depression and are, therefore, a potential biomarker of co-morbid depression. We also found evidence that supports the basis for testing whether neural features will predict treatment outcome. This proposal builds on these preliminary findings to validate our model and test the hypothesis that a set of neural features is shared across some subjects with MDD in epilepsy and is detectable with machine-learning techniques applied to interictal iEEG recordings. Aim 1 demonstrates the relationship between resting state neural circuit abnormality and depression. Aim 2 tests whether removing the dysfunctional region of the circuit improves depression and whether the presurgical resting state iEEG predicts that improvement.  To address these research goals, I will need more rigorous training in computational neuroscience for complex datasets, advanced signal processing, and biostatistics. My training plan and carefully selected mentoring and advisory team across fields of psychiatry, neurosurgery, neurology and statistics will allow me to obtain the necessary experiences to become a fully independent investigator who brings the tools of computational approaches to the service of mental health research and novel personalized treatment paradigms in epilepsy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric co-morbidities in epilepsy are common, undertreated, and poorly understood. Using intracranial recordings in patients who will undergo epilepsy surgery for medication-refractory disease, we propose to test a model that a set of neural features is shared across subjects with depression in epilepsy. We will use computational modeling to identify biomarkers of co-morbid depression, and assess whether removing the dysfunctional region of the circuit improves depression and whether presurgical neural features predict that improvement.",Distributed networks underlying depression in epilepsy: a computational circuit-based approach to biomarker development,9890582,K23NS110962,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Atrophic', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Excision', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Montgomery and Asberg depression rating scale', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Refractory Disease', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'anxiety spectrum disorders', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'network dysfunction', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'suicide rate', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2019,200178,-0.009849692631506644
"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them. Project narrative Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo treatments induce active neurobiological processes related to patients’ expectations, learned associations, perceived care and support, and hope for the future. Studying placebo treatments provides a window into these crucial context variables that will help understand vulnerability and resilience to mental health disorders and beyond.

"Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity Project Summary Prescription opioids, e.g., oxycodone (OXY), are commonly encountered in youth and pose a significant public health problem. In addition, there are significant individual differences in subjective responses to opioids which contribute to vulnerabilities for misuse. However, little is understood about OXY's effects on brain function, or on how individual differences in these effects might relate to variations in subjective responses. Assessment of OXY's effects on brain function is critical to understanding its abuse liability a n d will provide insight into how and why this drug leads to misuse and abuse/dependence in some, but not all, individuals. This proposal will assess the effects of low-dose OXY (10mg) on whole-brain functional connectivity (FC), and explore relationships with subjective responses in healthy young adults (ages 21 to 30 years, N=40) with limited prior opioid exposure. OXY's effects on FC during both reward- processing and resting-state will be assessed using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design incorporating multiband fMRI scanning. Subjective measures of drug response (e.g., `drug liking') will be collected before, during and after neuroimaging using NIDA PhenX measures. Neuroimaging data will be analyzed using data-driven methods to facilitate assessment of OXY's effects on FC both within hypothesized networks (e.g., salience and reward networks) as well as on patterns of between- network connectivity. Specifically, FC changes following OXY versus placebo (Aim 1) and relationships between these changes and subjective drug responses (Aim 2) will be assessed using intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD). ICD is a data-driven, voxel-to-voxel method of assessing whole-brain connectivity patterns that is not limited by specification of seed regions or connectivity thresholds. In addition, connectome-based machine-learning will be used to build a predictive model of subjective responses to OXY using data acquired during placebo scans (Aim 3). This project will for the first time assess the effects of a prescription opioid on whole-brain FC. Understanding OXY's effects on large-scale network dynamics is crucial for understanding its abuse liability, and will guide future studies of OXY in addicted and at-risk populations. Identification of networks that are predictive of subjective responses to OXY is an essential first step toward finding a reliable biomarker of opioid response that will help to identify individuals at highest risk for misuse. Project Narrative Prescription opioids are commonly encountered and, in a small proportion of individuals, may be a precursor to heroin initiation. This project will assess the effects of low-dose oxycodone (10mg) on brain function in healthy young adults (age 21 to 30 years). It will identify brain-based predictors of subjective opioid responses (`neural fingerprints') that can be used to inform prevention and intervention efforts.",Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity,9688964,R21DA045969,"['21 year old', 'Abstinence', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Cocaine', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Heroin', 'Heroin Users', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'Link', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Morphine', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurocognitive', 'Opioid', 'Oxycodone', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Spin Labels', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'executive function', 'financial incentive', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid misuse', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,251250,-0.015694934390901204
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9692060,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2019,857083,-0.007808200928685004
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology.

"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9747247,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,682492,-0.019239887338624116
"MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (COD) are common in the United States and providers have been challenged to provide effective treatments. As a consequence, their clients with COD may experience poor treatment engagement, symptom exacerbation and cycle in and out of emergency services. This is particularly true for underrepresented populations with a COD including individuals whom are homeless and involved in the criminally justice system. Research shows that integrated and coordinated community- based services for COD can improve client outcomes. However, healthcare workforce has a gap in training staff on such treatment techniques, which we aim to close via this Phase II STTR project.  Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is a unique evidence-based, trans-disciplinary treatment designed to address the complex needs of individuals with CODs and includes manuals for high risk populations of civilian and veteran homeless individuals as well as those involved in the criminally justice system. Listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration-Registry for Evidence Based Practices (NREPP), MISSION has had substantial impact. The Veterans Health Administration has deployed it in their national plan to end Veteran Homelessness. Massachusetts has used it in its Statewide Plan to End Homelessness and written it into Public Law for delivery alongside Veterans Treatment courts. While MISSION is a manualized treatment, a recent multisite implementation study identified the need for more comprehensive training tools. With NIAAA support, the University of Massachusetts Medical School (MISSION developers) partnered with Praxis on a Phase I STTR to (1) develop the MISSION University online training platform, (2) show proof of concept by implementing two training modules and an e-simulation case study, and (3) conduct a pilot randomized trial which demonstrated that training-as-usual Distance Learning (DL) + Technical Assistance (TA) outperformed TA alone.  In Phase II, we will complete MISSION U by developing and testing five new MISSION modules and companion e-simulations tools that test knowledge acquisition and application. We will first do a formative evaluation with 20 learners who will provide feedback on MISSION U modules. This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial similar to Phase I in which 60 learners will be randomized to the DL or the DL+TA conditions. In preparation for future scalability, we will uniquely conduct a qualitative process evaluation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework with 42 MISSION U participants to look at facilitators and barriers to implementation. Lastly, we will pilot test machine learning techniques with our 60 individuals who participated in the randomized trial in an effort to help personalize the MISSION U training experience for commercialization. !1 “MISSION U: A Multimedia Training Tool for Treatment of Individuals with Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders” is aimed at training providers of services for these individuals. MISSION U challenges prevailing provider training methodology that relies mainly on on-site provider training and/or online training using typical classroom-type materials. This project not only addresses the growing need for new provider training methodologies, but also offers the promise of improving clinical efficacy and reducing training costs and medical expenditures overall.! !",MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS,9774983,R42AA026751,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Assertiveness', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Community Outreach', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distance Learning', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency medical service', 'England', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based program', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laws', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Multimedia', 'National Health Services', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pre-Post Tests', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Videoconferences', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical efficacy', 'commercialization', 'community based service', 'computer science', 'cost', 'court', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'field study', 'formative assessment', 'health administration', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'outreach', 'peer', 'peer support', 'phase I trial', 'programs', 'prototype', 'provider networks', 'randomized trial', 'satisfaction', 'service providers', 'simulation', 'skills', 'sobriety', 'suicidal risk', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIAAA,"PRAXIS, INC.",R42,2019,751223,0.01621355074674383
"Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures,9674530,K99MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive signature', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2019,128483,-0.0002970136429897388
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"Using Wearable and Mobile Data to Diagnose and Monitor Movement Disorders The long-term goal of the proposed work is to develop a tool to help diagnose and monitor movement disorders. Due to increasing and aging world population, more people are living with these disorders. As there is already a shortage of neurologists, and more specifically, movement disorder specialists that have the training to adequately diagnose and manage these disorders, there is a large number of patients that are not receiving optimal treatment. We propose to use a smartphone-based platform to assess the severity of symptoms that are common across different movement disorders in order to achieve our long-term goal. To that end, the current study proposes to tackle 4 specific aims. The first aim will be to develop a mobile application to quantify common symptoms of movement disorders. We will develop a new mobile application that will enable the quantification of symptom severity; namely rest tremor, postural tremor, intention tremor, kinetic tremor, upper-limb coordination, bradykinesia, balance, gait, and cognitive impairments. The data collected from the smartphone-embedded sensors will be transmitted to a secure server where data can be visualized and analyzed. The second aim will be to collect data using the mobile application from healthy individuals as well as individuals with different movement disorders. We will collect data from 30 healthy controls, 30 individuals with Essential tremor (ET), 30 individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), 30 individuals with Huntington's disease (HD), 30 individuals with primary focal dystonia (PFD) of the upper-limb, 30 individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA, and 30 individuals with functional movement disorder (FMD). This dataset will enable us to develop algorithms (Aim 3) that will be used to assess symptom severity and differentiate the movement disorders according to the smartphone data. The third aim will be to develop algorithms to estimate symptom severity and distinguish the different movement disorders from one another. Using the data from the smartphone-embedded sensors, we will utilize machine learning approaches to estimate symptom severity (i.e. tremor, bradykinesia, gait impairment, etc.). Then, based on the symptom severity estimation as well as from features extracted from the sensor data, we will classify the subjects in groups according to their clinical diagnosis. This will enable us to differentiate the selected movement disorders. Finally, the fourth aim will be to assess the usability of the smartphone platform for long-term monitoring of patients. Subjects of patients recruited for Aim 2 will be asked to use the smartphone application at home for 8 weeks in order to determine compliance with its use and its stability over time. This study will provide a novel tool to assess motor and non-motor symptoms that could be used in other areas of research. It will provide a large database of movement, cognitive, demographic, and medical history data of individuals with different movement disorders. Most importantly, it will help in the differentiation and monitoring of movement disorders to improve the clinical management of individuals with these disorders. The prevalence of movement disorders is on the rise due to the expanding and aging world population while there is a lack of trained specialists in, and especially outside, of developed urban centers to adequately diagnose and manage those individuals. We propose that the ubiquity of smartphones could be leveraged to help non- specialists in the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of movement disorders that often exhibit overlapping symptoms such as Essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, primary focal dystonia, spinocerebllar ataxia, and functional movement disorders. We will develop a smartphone application that will collect data during different tasks to help differentiate these disorders and monitor them over time.",Using Wearable and Mobile Data to Diagnose and Monitor Movement Disorders,9655625,R15NS109741,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Bradykinesia', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dystonia', 'Economics', 'Equilibrium', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exhibits', 'Eye Movements', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Gait', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention Tremor', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical History', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Dystonias', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Rest Tremor', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Spinocerebellar Ataxias', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'common symptom', 'equilibration disorder', 'functional disability', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'motor symptom', 'non-motor symptom', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'progressive neurodegeneration', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NINDS,RBHS-SCHOOL/ HEALTH RELATED PROFESSIONS,R15,2019,399532,-0.003544574004155232
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9731643,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'sociodemographics', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,631649,-0.008888468636699239
"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life.

"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year 30. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care.3 This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time points before, during, and after routine visits with primary care providers (PCPs) through a new module to an online clinical process support system called CHADIS.",Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care,9778280,R44MH116751,"['17 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Moods', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Qualitative Research', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Specialist', 'Specialty Boards', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'checkup examination', 'child depression', 'control trial', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'programs', 'recruit', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'skills', 'success', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2019,242854,0.029727499285970592
"Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) are at increased risk for numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, substance use, HIV/AIDS, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Despite clear documentation and replication of these health disparities, relatively little is known about their development from adolescence into adulthood. Two theories primarily dominate the literature. Minority stress models describe unique life stressors experienced only by sexual minorities (e.g., victimization and discrimination based on sexual orientation) as primary contributors to health disparities. Other models implicate both minority stress and normative psychosocial processes together as contributors to health disparities. Some such normative processes include (1) psychological adjustment and characteristics (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, substance use expectancies), (2) disrupted social systems (e.g., family, peers, school), and (3) individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, temperament). To date, most studies of both minority stress and normative processes are limited by use of cross-sectional samples of primarily Caucasian adults. Although much has been learned from these studies, they do not permit analysis of emerging health disparities across development. Existing research is therefore limited in terms of both generalizability to diverse populations, and validity of directionality inferences between observed ‘predictors’ and ‘outcomes’. My long-term career goals are to identify mechanisms leading to disparities among sexual minorities, with the goal of improving treatments for these disparities, and to develop screening tools to identify high-risk youth who would benefit from prevention programs. To reach this goal, in this project, I address existing limitations to the literature using a prospective sample of individuals who were 14-19 years old at baseline and followed for over 4 years. My goal is to describe developmental trajectories and mechanisms of health disparity development for sexual minority youth compared with heterosexual youth across a 10-year developmental window spanning ages 14- 23 years. Longitudinal outcomes include depression/anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, sleep, general physical health, disordered eating and substance use. Developmental trajectories for these outcomes will be charted by gender and sexual orientation. Confirmatory analyses based on existing literature will be conducted to examine relations between minority stress and adverse outcomes. Then, I will use machine learning to identify as-yet unknown predictors of adverse outcomes and health disparities and characterize any changes in prediction across time. Finally, I will use state-of-the art intervening variable analyses (mediation, moderation) to evaluate longitudinal mechanisms through which health disparities emerge. Findings should provide insight into mechanisms of disparity development and maintenance, informing prevention and intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) experience wide-ranging disparities in mental and physical health that often persist into adulthood, yet little is known about development of these disparities. This research (1) examines developmental trajectories in mental and physical health outcomes from adolescence to young adulthood among sexual minority and matched heterosexual youth, (2) uses advanced statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to identify hypothesized and currently unknown factors that predict disparities over time, and (3) elucidates pathways to adversity and resilience. Experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual youth and young adults will be compared to uncover possible differences in developmental experiences that lead to health disparities, with possible implications for prevention and intervention among a highly vulnerable population.",Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing,9760277,F31MD014052,"['19 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Asthma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Documentation', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expectancy', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterosexuals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spirituality', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Victimization', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'emerging adult', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'non-heterosexual', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer victimization', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'resilience', 'sexual identity', 'sexual minority', 'sexual risk behavior', 'social', 'stressor', 'substance misuse', 'theories', 'treatment disparity', 'young adult']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,33183,0.02396419597662147
"MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing. ABSTRACT As rates of adolescent depression and suicidality continue to trend upwards, the healthcare system struggles to address the need for and lack of mental health service use. The pediatric patient-centered medical home model may improve adolescent depression outcomes by enhancing access to and coordinating care, as well as providing ongoing monitoring. Unfortunately, despite guideline recommendations, over 2/3 of adolescents identified with depression symptoms in primary care do not receive symptom monitoring and 19% do not re- ceive symptom reassessment. This lack of symptom monitoring and reassessment can result in untoward health outcomes including a decrease in functioning, increased use of acute and crisis services, and hospitali- zations due to suicidality. Current technologies which incorporate data passively collected from smartphones offer an opportunity for intercurrent monitoring between patient visits which limits burden on the patient to self- report and limits burden on the healthcare system, allowing primary care teams to triage contacting and as- sessing patients a system identifies with an increase in disease severity. This formative study will demonstrate the usability and potential clinical utility of MoodRing, a technology intervention which will collect passive mo- bile phone sensor data on aspects of adolescent phone use related to depressive symptom severity (e.g. com- munication patterns, social media use, travel) and integrate this data into a multi-user (adolescent, parent, pri- mary care provider/care manager) platform from which symptoms can be viewed and secure communication can occur. MoodRing, as supported by Health Belief Model, may lead to improved quality of depression man- agement (increased symptom reassessment, therapy/medication adherence) through increasing self-efficacy, social support from parent and care team, as well as encouraging application of self-management skills through increased self-management knowledge, skills, and symptom feedback. MoodRing builds on a solid foundation of investigators experienced in design of technology interventions to increase adolescent initiation of depression treatment, who have already developed machine algorithms for passive sensing and a small business partner with vast experience in working with health researchers to develop multi-user web/mobile platforms. This STTR Phase I study seeks to accomplish two aims. The first is to apply a machine learning pipeline developed for college-aged youth to adolescents with depression and determine whether self-reported depressive symptoms can be reliably predicted from passive data with at least 85% accuracy. The second is the user design and system architecture of MoodRing. If milestones are achieved that models are successful at predicting depressive symptoms and the proposed MoodRing intervention is acceptable to adolescents, par- ents, and primary care providers/care managers, then we will pursue the STTR Phase II study. The aims of Phase II include the development and subsequent efficacy trial of MoodRing. Specifically, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting of MoodRing as compared to usual care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression affects up to a fifth of adolescents but less than half get treatment. This project aims to develop and design MoodRing, a technology platform, which will gather information about how an adolescent uses their mobile phone and translate that into what it means about symptoms of depression they are experiencing. This platform will provide symptom feedback to the adolescent themselves, their parent, and their healthcare pro- vider, with the goal that having awareness of symptoms and a safe place to communicate with parents and healthcare providers will allow for more adolescents to better self-manage their mood and get better quality treatment for depression.",MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing.,9908603,R44MH122067,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bile fluid', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social support', 'Solid', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'aged', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'health belief', 'health care service utilization', 'health service use', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric patients', 'persistent symptom', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'primary care setting', 'routine screening', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sensor', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'social media', 'suicide rate', 'system architecture', 'therapy adherence', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response', 'trend', 'university student', 'usability']",NIMH,NURELM E-BUSINESS SOFTWARE,R44,2019,223419,0.01022670168508768
"Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression Project Summary/Abstract Depression is the most common complication of pregnancy and affects 10-20% of women. Up to 75% of women with perinatal depression do not receive mental health care. In lower income African American and Hispanic women, the prevalence of perinatal depression (PND) is particularly high and the treatment rates are lower. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment but practical barriers such as time commitment, insurance coverage, and transportation, as well as stigma, limit uptake of CBT particularly for minority women. Similarly, concern about the adverse effects of antidepressant treatment on maternal and infant outcomes limits uptake of pharmacological treatments. A novel avenue for the development of safe therapeutics for depression focuses on the brain-gut axis and is supported by initial demonstrations that probiotics can improve mood symptoms. Our long-term goal is to assist in the discovery of potential microbes that are correlated with PND, and could be novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, particularly in minority women. As a first step, we propose a multi-PI feasibility study involving the implementation and optimization of processes for participant recruitment and stool sample collection, as well as the initial assessments of longitudinal differences in gut microbiota between pregnant women with and without major depressive disorder (MDD). To meet these goals, we will leverage an established research infrastructure to conduct a prospective, nested case-control study. We will prospectively collect depression diagnoses and gut microbiome samples on 300 women at four points during pregnancy and after delivery to yield a total of 58 women, 29 cases with MDD and 29 controls without MDD. The two groups will be matched on key covariates (e.g., age, race, socio- economic status, gestational age, health). At their scheduled usual care, prenatal appointment, consented participants will complete mental health, demographics, microbiome-related, and dietary and physical habits questionnaires and provide a fecal sample either at that time of their appointment or at home. To achieve our first aim - to determine the feasibility of a larger similarly designed study - we will estimate the total number of potential participants, the number assessed and not assessed for eligibility (and reasons), the number excluded and reasons for exclusion, the number lost to follow-up, and the data available for analysis at each of the 4 visits. To achieve our second aim - to determine whether the gut microbiome dynamically differs in pregnant women with and without MDD - we will employ a suite of systems level approaches, including multivariate statistical techniques, network modeling and machine learning techniques. This R03 will allow us to optimize our research processes for the prospective collection of stool samples and mental health data in preparation for larger nested case-control studies, and ultimately clinical trials of probiotic therapies for PND. Project Narrative Up to 75% of women diagnosed with depression during pregnancy and the postpartum receive inadequate treatment, in large part due to concerns about the safety of antidepressants. Here we propose a feasibility study in preparation for a larger study to determine whether women with depression during their pregnancy and after their delivery have alterations in the bacterial communities in their intestine. Identifying which bacteria are associated with depression is a critical first step in the development of safe probiotic treatments for depression during pregnancy. !",Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression,9767273,R03HD095056,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Appointment', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Endocrine system', 'Epidemiology', 'Exclusion', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feces', 'Germ-Free', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nutritional', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'antepartum depression', 'antidepressant effect', 'bacterial community', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'drug development', 'dysbiosis', 'effective therapy', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal transplantation', 'follow-up', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'health data', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'maternal stress', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microorganism', 'mood symptom', 'network models', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'nutrition', 'perinatal mental health', 'peripartum depression', 'probiotic therapy', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample collection', 'social stigma', 'stool sample', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment as usual', 'uptake']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R03,2019,83193,0.024193611503574124
"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. Given elevated rates of violence among socio- disadvantaged adolescents with disparities in access to services, the proposed intervention, if efficacious, has the potential for significant public health impact, especially in low-resource urban communities.",Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement,9636306,R01HD097107,"['20 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Systems', 'Criminal Justice', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dose', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homicide', 'Hospitals', 'Imprisonment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Minority', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Variant', 'Victimization', 'Violence', 'Violent injury', 'Work', 'Youth', 'arm', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'experience', 'gun violence', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'injured', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'recidivism', 'secondary outcome', 'societal costs', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'violence prevention', 'youth violence']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,662984,0.010569646350051446
"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9750800,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2019,118352,0.0029636707527940257
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9780580,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2019,7702,0.03410662152778567
"Efficacy of biomarker-guided rTMS for treatment resistant depression Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global disability, and approximately 30% of MDD patients are resistant to conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an FDA-cleared intervention with proven efficacy in treatment-resistant depression, but only 30–40% of these patients achieve remission after a single course. Other studies have shown that rTMS targeting the dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC) is comparably effective, but biomarkers for informing target site selection and predicting differential treatment response are not currently available. Diagnostic heterogeneity has been a major obstacle to biomarker discovery efforts. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to diagnosing four novel MDD subtypes or “biotypes” defined by distinct resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns in Valence System circuits and predicting differing antidepressant responses at the individual level to rTMS targeting the DMPFC. This confirmatory efficacy trial will test a novel, biotype-guided treatment selection strategy motivated by the hypothesis that an individual patient's likelihood of responding to left DLFPC vs. DMPFC rTMS is determined in part by individual differences in 1) the degree to which their symptoms are driven by dysfunction in specific downstream amygdala, striatal, and salience network targets comprising aspects of Valence Systems; and 2) the degree to which dysfunction in those targets can be modulated by stimulating the left DLPFC or DMPFC. Subjects (N=405) will be randomized to receive a) biotype-guided 10 Hz rTMS targeting the DMPFC or left DLPFC; b) to a disconfirmation arm receiving rTMS targeting the opposite site; and c) to a third arm receiving FDA-cleared, standard-of-care 10 HZ rTMS targeting the left DLFPC, regardless of biotype. All patients will be tested before and after treatment on a battery of fMRI, behavioral, and clinical assessments, grounded in RDoC-informed measures of emotion regulation and effort valuation, which will enable us to validate downstream brain circuit treatment targets and test for target engagement, in conjunction with state-of-the-art, anatomically realistic electric field modeling and fiber tractography. The primary goal is to confirm the efficacy of a novel RSFC biomarker-guided approach to differential treatment selection in treatment resistant depression, with the potential for significantly enhanced efficacy compared to the current standard-of-care. Depression is the second leading cause of disability worldwide, due partly to the fact that existing antidepressants are not effective for all patients and it is often challenging to match individual patients to the treatments that are most likely to help them. This project will test a new strategy for using fMRI brain scans to predict antidepressant response and assist clinicians in choosing which of two antidepressant treatments— transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting one of two depression-related brain areas—is most likely to benefit an individual patient.",Efficacy of biomarker-guided rTMS for treatment resistant depression,9648914,R01MH118388,"['Accounting', 'Aftercare', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anhedonia', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease remission', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'anxious', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical predictors', 'comparative efficacy', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'efficacy trial', 'electric field', 'emotion regulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tractography', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,1245371,0.00840944058087703
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9725782,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biologic Development', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,446742,0.01146128353773588
"Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies Project Summary  To address the burden of mental illness, National institute of Mental Health encourages development of computational approaches that provide novel ways to understand relationships among complex, large datasets to further the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of mental diseases. These datasets are multi- dimensional, including clinical assessments, behavioral symptoms, biological measurements such as neu- roimaging and psychophysiological data. The overall objective of this grant is to advance methodology for analyzing such data to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease, to improve the understanding of individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes, and to provide the capac- ity to handle both cross-sectional and longitudinal data.  Our proposal will leverage two civilian trauma cohorts recruited through the Grady Trauma Project and the Grady Emergency Department Study, and an external validation cohort from the Hill Center study with a similar distribution of trauma exposure. We propose to develop statistically principled, computationally efﬁ- cient statistical learning methods for addressing key challenges in analyzing these large datasets. Challenges include multi-type outcomes, high dimensional data with sparse signals and high noise levels, spatial and tem- poral dependence of neuroimaging data, and heterogeneous effects across patient population. The scientiﬁc premise of this computational psychiatry research is that analytical methods integrating information from brain, behavior, and symptoms will provide much-needed data driven platforms for improving diagnosis and prediction of PTSD and other mental disorders.  In this application, we propose: (1) to develop partial generalized tensor regression methods and partial tensor quantile regression methods that can simultaneously achieve accurate prediction of clinical outcomes and efﬁcient feature extraction from high dimensional neuroimaging biomarkers; (2) to develop tensor response quantile regression methods and global inference that can achieve comprehensive and robust understanding of the heterogeneity in high-dimensional neuroimaging phenotypes in terms of environmental factors such as trauma exposure; and (3) to develop and extend methods in Aims 1 and 2 for longitudinal multi-dimensional data that will enable prediction of future post-trauma symptom severity trajectories in terms of neuroimaging biomarkers and robustify the evaluation of the impact of psychophysiological factors on neuroimaging phe- notypes. The proposed methods will be applied to the two Grady studies to address scientiﬁc hypotheses relevant to PTSD research. We will use the Hill Center study as an independent validation cohort to evaluate the reproducibility and generalizability of the ﬁndings. User-friendly software will be developed. The proposed methodology is generally applicable to many other mental health studies with complex multi-dimensional data. Narrative We propose to develop statistical methods for analyzing large-scale and multi-dimensional data in mental health studies to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease and to help understand individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes. The applications of the proposed methods will generate new knowledge to further the understanding of the mechanism and progression of the PTSD that will lead to improved disease management strategies.","Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies",9839143,R01MH118771,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child Sexual Abuse', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'burden of illness', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predict clinical outcome', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'user friendly software', 'vector']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,614061,0.03398371832041067
"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology. Early interventions crafted using these growth charts would benefit the public health by reducing the huge disability associated with psychiatric disorders and limiting the costs to society at large.",Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry,9810689,R01MH120482,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Age', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Early Intervention', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'externalizing behavior', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'portability', 'quality assurance', 'response', 'segregation', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'somatosensory', 'synergism', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,780855,0.015024726198213665
"Developmental Variations in Corticostriatal Thalamocortical Circuits and their Relationship to Psychopathology ABSTRACT Detailed characterizations of brain development are essential to understanding factors underlying the emergence of psychopathology and its progression. Corticostriatal thalamocortical (CSTC) circuits are central to current models of both externalizing and internalizing psychopathologies. However, our understanding of their development and the impact of pathologic processes on these circuits is primarily limited to regional structural properties and specific disorders (e.g., Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). As such, there is a need for a more comprehensive examination of CSTC circuit development and its relations to psychopathology. The overarching goals of the proposed work are to characterize the development of CSTC circuits using structural MRI and resting state functional MRI, and to link variations in their trajectories to the emergence of psychopathology. We will model developmental trajectories of structural morphology and functional interactions within seven CSTC networks defined based on their connectivity with large-scale cortical networks and relate deviations to externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Consistent with recent calls for secondary analysis of existing datasets to accelerate the identification of brain-behavior relationships that may serve as modifiable clinical targets, the proposed work will make use of openly shared pediatric imaging datasets (ages: 5.0-24.0; high resolution T1 anatomical and resting state functional scans for each participant). Specifically, we will generate a large-scale aggregate cross-sectional sample (n = 3918) for the purposes of delineating trajectories for the seven CSTC networks. We train age-prediction models for each of the networks and pool their predictions to generate multivariate CSTC maturity profiles for each individual. These profiles will be used to subtype individuals into neurobiologically homogenous subgroups, which are expected to differ with respect to dimensional measures of psychopathology calculated using the bifactor model framework (i.e. general psychopathology [p-factor], internalizing, externalizing). An aggregate longitudinal sample (n = 250; 3 time- points per participant, each 12-15 months apart) will be generated to evaluate the ability of changes in CSTC maturity profiles over time to predict longitudinal changes in psychopathology. Specific aims of the proposed work are to: 1) Estimate the developmental trajectories of seven CSTC networks; 2) Determine associations between CSTC network maturity profile subtypes and dimensions of psychopathology; and 3) Evaluate predictive relationships between longitudinal changes in maturity profiles and those in dimensions of psychopathology. Given the scale of the datasets employed, cloud-based computing, and optimized analytic frameworks will be leveraged to ensure the feasibility of achieving the proposed work within the project period. All codes developed will be openly shared. NARRATIVE We will characterize developmental trajectories of corticostriatal-thalamocortical circuits, which are critical for the acquisition and refinement of behavior, and widely implicated in psychiatric and neurological disorders. We develop growth charts for these circuits and assess how deviations relate to the emergence of psychopathology in children and adolescents.",Developmental Variations in Corticostriatal Thalamocortical Circuits and their Relationship to Psychopathology,9652113,R21MH118556,"['Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Properdin', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Sex Differences', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'secondary analysis', 'sex']",NIMH,"CHILD MIND INSTITUTE, INC.",R21,2019,220232,-0.030889126198829314

"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9743648,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'MRI Scans', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,0.005336159011965349
"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,9605296,R01MH114028,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Paraphilias', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Social Processes', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'aggression prevention', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data structure', 'early childhood', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'mental state', 'morphometry', 'multimodal data', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'pediatric trauma', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2019,698908,-0.006095376858791138
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder.

"Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal responds to RFA-MH-17-612, “Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34).” We have shown in several randomized trials that family-focused therapy (FFT) for symptomatic youth at high-risk for bipolar disorder - consisting of psychoeducation and family communication and problem solving skills training - is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in hastening symptomatic recovery. However, between 50%-60% of high-risk youth still have residual mood symptoms and functional impairment after 18 weeks of FFT. In our prior studies, two constructs have emerged as predictors of lack of response to treatment: mood instability in the child and expressed emotion (EE) in parents (i.e., frequent critical comments or hostility). In adolescents (ages 12-18) with a parent with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, we hypothesize that augmenting FFT with frequent and targeted interventions in the home setting through a Smartphone app (MyCoachConnect, or MCC) will (a) have a greater and more rapid impact than standard FFT on the targeted mechanisms of mood instability in adolescents and EE in parents, and (b) as a result, enhance symptom resolution and functioning in adolescents. To be eligible, adolescents must score high on parent-rated measures of mood instability, and have at least one parent who is high-EE by speech sample coding criteria. The MCC app will record weekly open speech samples from parents and children and daily and weekly mood ratings from adolescents. The app assessments will be fed back to the FFT clinician, who will use this information to “push” recommendations for mood regulation, communication, and problem-solving strategies (linked to the FFT modules) for parents and youth. In year 1, we will conduct an open trial (n=25) to determine (a) the feasibility and acceptability of FFT with mobile coaching (FFT-MCC), as given by clinicians in community settings, and (b) associations between online/speech feature proxies of the targets (mood instability and EE as measured weekly by MCC) and standard measures of the targets. In years 2 and 3 we will conduct a 75- case RCT in which families are assigned to FFT with MCC skills coaching, FFT with MCC assessments only, with no coaching; or FFT Only, without MCC. We hypothesize that FFT-MCC will be acceptable to parents, adolescents and clinicians, and more effective than FFT without MCC coaching or FFT-Only in engaging the targets of mood instability and EE and promoting improvements in adolescents' mood symptoms and quality of life over 27 weeks. The study will facilitate the translation of a technological augmentation to an evidence-based family intervention, with the goal of increasing treatment access among families with mood disorders. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a 12-session evidence- based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC “real time” assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders Project Summary: Early life psychosocial adversity and stress are well-established as the most powerful environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children. Impairments in developing emotion regulation and cognitive control and associated alterations in brain development have been shown to mediate the effects of adversity on risk for the development of psychopathology. Early psychosocial adversity impacts the epigenetic and inflammation-mediated processes that contribute to these negative outcomes, a process known as “biological embedding of stress.” While this risk trajectory has been clearly linked to increased rates of psychopathology, the mechanisms of this process, its targetable mediators and how early in development they operate are yet to be determined. Here we focus on the effects of early life adversity on brain, emotion regulation and cognitive control outcomes relevant to risk for mental disorders, beginning antenatally and extending to age 3. We will examine the role of pre- and postnatal adversity/stress, the maternal and child perinatal gut microbiome and early caregiver support on these key neurodevelopmental outcomes utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging. Our unifying hypothesis is that these factors modulate systemic inflammatory responses, induce neuronal effects through this and other processes that adversely impact brain development in limbic and cortical regions, and mediate the effects of early adversity on child emotion regulation, cognitive control and mental health outcomes. These factors will be studied in a unique, prospectively ascertained cohort of 370 mothers and their offspring at high psychosocial risk being recruited as part of an already funded March of Dimes project at Washington University. The cohort will include both term- and prematurely-born infants and toddlers given the increased risk of psychosocial adversity and aberrant gut microbiome in preterm children. The offspring will be intensively prospectively studied from the 1st trimester to age 3, providing a unique dataset in which to examine the interrelationships among pre- and postnatal adversity, biomarkers of inflammation, the gut microbiome and developmental and mental health outcomes. The perinatal and early childhood periods are critical times to study these exposures as adverse neurodevelopment associated with adversity begins in utero through fetal programming. Likewise, the perinatal period is a critical developmental window for microbial influences, when gut microbial colonization has its most enduring effects. The proposed study merges established research groups in these areas in a center with advanced infant and childhood neuroimaging and extensive microbiome expertise, and offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand the mechanisms of the biological embedding of adversity on brain, cognitive and emotional trajectories in a high-risk cohort. We will also apply innovative computational methods, using Deep Learning, to extend understanding of these data. Findings will provide critical and novel insights to inform early preventive interventions relevant to emotional, cognitive and mental health outcomes for children at greatest risk. Project Narrative This study will investigate the mechanisms by which psychosocial adversity experienced in utero and early in life impact the child’s brain, cognitive and emotional development, testing the hypothesis that stress and adversity during pregnancy adversely affect early brain development through inflammatory mechanisms. Another important focus of this project is to examine how the maternal perinatal microbiome and infant’s gut microbiome during early childhood impact brain development, either through the infant’s inflammatory response or other effects. A third focus is to explore the effects of caregiver support on this risk trajectory, testing the idea that high caregiver support reduces the negative influences of early adversity, altered immune biomarkers and disruptions in the gut microbiome.","Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders",9701281,R01MH113883,"['3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caregiver support', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Funding', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informal Social Control', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mothers', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Poverty', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'antenatal', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'gray matter', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiome', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal period', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,2374629,0.013457563395094489
"The Center for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NEUROMAP) Project Summary Mood and anxiety disorders will account for approximately $16 x 109 lost productivity or 25% of global GDP over the next 20 years. Eating disorders are among the deadliest psychiatric diseases and Anorexia Nervosa is two to three times more deadly than schizophrenia, bipolar and major depressive disorder. The Center for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NeuroMAP) aims to provide a (a) scientific, (b) operational, and (c) educational infrastructure for innovative neuroscience-based research to use individual differences on several biological levels together with sophisticated statistical approaches to generate clinically meaningful predictions of risk and outcomes for mood, anxiety, and eating disorders. The Laureate Institute for Brain Research (LIBR) in Tulsa, OK, is ideally placed to provide this infrastructure because: (a) LIBR has recruited young investigators with an impressive track record of scientific productivity, (b) LIBR is situated adjacent to the Laureate Psychiatric Clinic and Hospital (LPCH), one of the Midwest's largest psychiatric facilities that provides LIBR with a pipeline for patient recruitment, and (c) LIBR closely collaborates with the University of Tulsa (TU) on computational statistics and University of Oklahoma, Tulsa (OU) on bioassay research. The Specific Aims of NeuroMAP are: (1) To provide a state of the art neuroimaging and laboratory infrastructure to conduct biological experiments with multi-level assessments using core facilities; (2) To provide a mentoring infrastructure to a group of young investigators to conduct studies that identify predictive biological markers and processes for patients with mood or anxiety disorders; (3) To create a career development infrastructure to accelerate the investigator's transition from young investigator to established investigator; (4) To build an operational infrastructure that provides the tools necessary to conduct the research projects, standardize assessments and provide a data repository for future pilot projects. NeuroMAP will consists of: (a) an Administrative Core (Paulus): to establish the infrastructure necessary to expand the research efforts of the young investigators; (b) Research Core (Bodurka, Teague, McKinney): to provide the technical expertise to utilize multi-level approaches (from cell markers to symptoms) to quantify individual differences and generate outcome predictions.

"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology). The findings will yield novel classification approaches for negative symptom severity, may identify novel treatment targets (circuitry), and may yield classifications to stratify patients to treatment conditions.",ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits,9851722,R01MH121246,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Aphasia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Face', 'Factor Analysis', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Informatics', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychopathology', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Social Processes', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'computational platform', 'dimensional analysis', 'disability', 'druggable target', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient stratification', 'pleasure', 'quality assurance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'social', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'working group']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,1010160,-0.00644696973959583
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9747293,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multi-task learning', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'premature neonates', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,452012,-0.016313932531213455

"Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation Project Summary  We are in critical need of targeted and individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affect nearly 50% of Americans during our lifetimes. Brain stimulation treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), represent the front-line of innovative approaches to correct dysfunctional brain networks for patients suffering from mental illness. rTMS is FDA-approved for depression and obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) with clinical trials underway for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use, among others. However, as currently administered, rTMS lacks a biomarker to individually optimize treatment and thus suffers from a poor clinical response rate (<50%). Without personalization of rTMS, we risk a one-size-fits-all treatment for all psychiatric disorders, not dissimilar to how antidepressants are administered.  Using simultaneous TMS and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), I identified a depression severity biomarker from a double-blind randomized clinical trial treating depressed patients with one month of active or placebo rTMS. The degree of this biomarker change significantly predicted clinical improvement after rTMS treatment. Direct brain recordings further suggest that a single stimulation session is sufficient to modulate this biomarker, indicating that this brain-based biomarker can be monitored daily to support empiric treatment optimization.  With this in mind, I propose to develop the first broadly generalizable platform for real-time biomarker monitoring (Aim #1) and personalized rTMS treatment (Aims #2 & 3). I will enroll 54 depressed patients to participate in a cross-over, placebo-controlled study directly comparing personalized, adaptive rTMS to standard rTMS. Primary outcome will be target engagement and dose-response of the depression severity biomarker. Successful implementation of this work includes the early stratification of treatment responders and personalized and more effective treatments for non-responders. This approach is broadly applicable to other depression biomarkers, all psychiatric populations treated with rTMS, and other brain stimulation modalities. More generally, my goals are to establish the fundamental principles of human brain plasticity and to construct platforms for rapid biomarker development, engagement, and integration into personalized brain stimulation treatments. Project Narrative We need targeted, individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affects nearly 50% of Americans. Brain stimulation treatments target dysfunctional brain networks with minimal side effects but are currently applied in a one-size-fits-all manner, thus limiting its efficacy. I aim to develop a non-invasive personalized brain stimulation platform for neuropsychiatric disorders; here I will create a real-time monitoring system for brain changes, evaluate the mechanism underlying these brain changes, and develop and test an adaptive stimulation paradigm to maximally drive individual brain changes and improve clinical outcome.","Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation",9794069,DP5OD028128,"['Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Markers', 'Book Chapters', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Length', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinical predictors', 'depressed patient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'journal article', 'lectures', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'off-patent', 'placebo controlled study', 'primary outcome', 'professor', 'real time monitoring', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'side effect', 'tenure track', 'time use', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment responders', 'treatment stratification']",OD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP5,2019,391249,0.012642652682037387
"Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood traumatic stress (CTS), resulting from experiences such as abuse and neglect, is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences effecting overall health across the lifespan. Growing evidence shows that the negative effects of CTS are not limited to a single individual and may be transmitted across generations, increasing the risk for behavioral and psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Psychological stress during pregnancy is associated with heightened stress responses, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral problems in infancy and early childhood potentially making it a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The majority of studies examining maternal psychological stress (MPS) during pregnancy consider the magnitude of stress as the `risk factor' for alterations in offspring development; however, psychological stress, particularly during the prenatal period, is dynamic and variable. Infant neurodevelopment occurs sequentially and is sensitive to environmental influences, meaning that the effect of any insult is likely as much about the timing, as it is the magnitude. As a result, it remains unclear which aspects of stress most strongly impact offspring development – is it simply the magnitude as previously suggested, or does the trajectory matter as well? Understanding the variability of prenatal factors and their influence on infant neurobiological and psychosocial development is critical to targeting preventive interventions. The goal of this proposal is to explore maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress. The overall hypothesis is that a history of maternal CTS will increase the amplitude and velocity of MPS trajectories compared to a low-risk group, will predict increased offspring limbic system connectivity and negative affect expression, and that an intervention to reduce MPS in a high-risk sample will alter the observed trajectories. These hypotheses will be tested using a novel methodology that characterizes the longitudinal heterogeneity of psychological symptom data to create MPS trajectories. These trajectories will be used to explore the role of timing and rate of change of MPS on offspring neurobiological and affective development and, further, to test whether these trajectories mediate the effects of CTS on infant development. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To characterize the longitudinal heterogeneity of MPS in a sample of women with and without a history of CTS; (2) To examine the effects of heterogeneous longitudinal trajectories in MPS on offspring limbic system and negative affect development in mothers with and without childhood trauma; and (3) (Exploratory) To determine whether an intervention designed to reduce MPS will alter MPS trajectories in a high-risk sample. This study aims to elucidate the importance of trajectories of MPS for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS. Achieving these goals will provide insight into the best timing for targeted screening and interventions to alter MPS during pregnancy for women with a history of CTS and, thereby, reduce the risk of offspring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood traumatic stress is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences for psychological well-being, such as increased stress reactivity and increased risk for perinatal psychopathology. The proposed research will integrate tools from developmental neuroscience, clinical science, and computer science to: (1) examine the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a potential mediator of childhood traumatic stress on infant brain and negative affect development; and (2) evaluate whether an intervention designed to reduce maternal psychological stress will alter the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal prenatal stress. By identifying the importance of trajectories of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS, this work stands to improve the targeting and timing of prenatal interventions for women with a history of childhood traumatic stress.",Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress,9794014,F30MH118762,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Limbic System', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'maternal stress', 'mindfulness based cognitive therapy', 'negative affect', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatric trauma', 'prenatal', 'prenatal intervention', 'prenatal stress', 'psychological symptom', 'psychosocial development', 'random forest', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'stress reactivity', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,0.007862686786865603
"Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language. Under Aim 2 we will develop the technical means to integrate the ontology in a web service infrastructure. Aim 3 is to create the infrastructure to be used by those seeking and those providing trauma care assessment and to enable comparison of organizational structures of trauma care environments. In the process of comparing organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems, data will be collected from the user and stored in our data repository. Thus, while running the service, we will also be creating a data source about organization of trauma centers and trauma systems, which we will make available to those conducting comparative research on the impact of organizational structures of trauma care facilities on patient outcomes under Aim 4. The interrelation between organizational structures and patient outcome is known in the public health literature, but we lack tools to explore its effects on trauma care environments in a computer-assisted manner; our project will provide an IT framework resolving this lack. It will contribute to information and knowledge processing, advanced information retrieval, and incorporation of machine intelligence into decision processes. By providing a common schema, it will also contribute to the integration of heterogeneous data types. Our project will impact the work of organizations that assess, verify, or designate trauma care environments, as well as organizations interested in self-assessing their own organization. Supporting comparison of these organizations will not only affect assessment or certification but also add to the comparability of patient outcome data by linking it to specific organizational components. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop an IT framework accessible on the Internet that facilitates and optimizes verification of trauma centers and consultation of trauma systems and fosters comparability between trauma care environments with different organizational structures and under different legislations. Making these structures more comparable will not only benefit those who provide verification or consultation to trauma care environments, it will also allow organizations unable to acquire assessment through third parties to do in-house assessments based on data collected through best-practice assessments for the benefits of the patients. In providing these services, our framework will collect data on the organization trauma care environments, and our framework will make that data available for researchers interested in comparative studies.",Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care,9649217,R01GM111324,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Imagery', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organizational Models', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Assessment', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Violence', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'automated reasoning', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'data access', 'data management', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'organizational structure', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'tool', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2019,116529,0.02841737424679913
"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of “non-monotone” missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ﬂawed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ﬁxed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiﬁc domains, making “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiﬁc reporting. Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Narrative We will develop, implement and disseminate an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software tool to evaluate the robustness to missing data assumptions of clinical trials in which binary outcomes are collected at ﬁxed points over time but where participants intermittently miss their scheduled assess- ments, as frequently occurs in addiction research. We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiﬁc reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9756356,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,486320,0.019299111987991342
"Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma Project Summary Childhood trauma dramatically increases the risk of adult psychiatric illness and significantly alters symptom complexity and treatment outcomes. Discovering causal factors and novel interventions could have a dramatic impact on treating psychiatric illness. Over the past decade, there has been a growing appreciation for the role of the gut microbiota in normal brain development and behavior and of critical modulatory effects of the gut microbiota on mental health. Interactions of microbiota with stress-related hormonal, immune, and inflammatory processes in the brain are particularly well supported. Thus, there is intense interest in understanding how interactions among stress, microbiome, and brain (the “stress-biome-brain” axis; SBB) contribute to a significant impact on mental health. We will address the hypothesis that adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. First, we will characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics in mice following recurrent trauma. Mice exposed to recurrent predation stress or to control conditions will be assessed for changes in the gut microbiota, hippocampal gene expression, and behavior. We will use these data to construct multi-level models and predict causal interactions among stress, microbiome, brain, and behavior. Next, we will test the hypothesis that changes in the gut microbiota induced by childhood trauma have causal effects in the brain. We will perform fecal transplants from trauma-exposed mice into naïve mice and measure changes in brain gene expression. These experiments will be performed in a germ-free mouse facility in mice with a small specified number of species, for precise control of microbial content. In addition, we will test strategies for perturbation of the microbial community and to assess behavioral outcomes in the germ-free facility. The data generated will set the stage for precision perturbation studies of the microbiota and its effects on behavior and for future translational studies. Project Narrative Adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome may contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. We will conduct experiments designed to characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics using state of the art genomics and systems biology. The results will provide a ranked list of the factors predicted to drive neuronal and behavioral responses across the system and will form the framework to test their causality.",Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma,9821596,R21MH118597,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early-life trauma', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predatory Behavior', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Trauma', 'Trauma recovery', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'comparative', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fecal transplantation', 'genome sciences', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'multilevel analysis', 'network models', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'synergism', 'translational study', 'trauma exposure', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2019,231602,0.017369245290822687
"Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents. PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Children and adolescents often grow up in the face of substantial developmental stress (i.e. trauma). While for some, this shifts the developmental trajectory to that of mental and general health disorders, others are resilient. Most research on developmental psychopathology is focused on risk while little is known on the mechanisms that confer resilience. The current study aims to identify biological (genomic, immune), psychological and cognitive mechanisms that underpin resilience in youth as defined by having low mood- anxiety and suicidal outcomes in youth with substantial developmental stress exposure (i.e. trauma and family history of depression). Elucidating resilience mechanisms has huge clinical implications as it will improve stratification of risk to develop depression and/or suicidal behavior, and could identify biological, psychological and cognitive targets that can inform development of future preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience, reducing the mental and general health adverse outcomes associated with childhood adversity. The study capitalizes on a large dataset of genotyped youths from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that have been comprehensively phenotyped for cognitive performance and psychopathology, and that reported substantial trauma exposure. The proposed research integrates genomic and cognitive data with clinical measures used to define resilience in cross sectional analysis of ~9500 PNC youths (Aim 1); incorporates longitudinal data of depression and suicide measures, pulled from electronic medical record in a subset of ~750 PNC youths (Aim 2); and relies on prospective data collection that includes immune profiling of selected PNC individuals to allow identification of immune signature of resilience (Aim 3). Integration of genomic with clinical, cognitive and immune data will allow predictive modeling, and Big Data driven analysis will allow identification of resilience mechanisms. The candidate is a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist physician scientist who is committed to translational research in youth at risk for psychiatric conditions. His overarching career goal is to develop methods for early identification of subclinical phenotypes before the onset of major psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression and suicide attempts) and, through neuroscience informed interventions, divert the developmental trajectory from that of risk to that of resilience. The career development plan capitalizes on a multidisciplinary mentorship team. It involves one-on one mentoring with the primary “clinical research” mentor as well as the genomic, biostatistical, neurocognitive and immune system expert co- mentors, integrated with hands on research supervision in data collection and statistical analysis, and didactic coursework and workshops. The program is tailored to meet research and training aims. The project will be conducted in the fostering environment of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, that will provide the academic mentorship and the required resources to execute the research and training aims, allowing the candidate to launch an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood adversities impose risk to general and mental health development, including youth depression and suicidal behavior, still most children are resilient. Through integration of genetic, clinical, cognitive and demographic data from research data and medical records, this study will identify mechanisms that underpin resilience in a generalizable large sample of community youth with substantial exposure to adversity. Understanding resilience mechanisms is a critical milestone on the mission to develop neuroscience informed preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience and reducing the health burden of early life adversity.",Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents.,9806213,K23MH120437,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Suicide attempt', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'child depression', 'childhood adversity', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'early life adversity', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'hands on research', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'research clinical testing', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'stress related disorder', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K23,2019,193644,-0.009355950480102168
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9493548,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2018,163943,-0.005409325619097932
"Machine learning for data-driven subtyping of major depression Major depressive disorder is highly prevalent, and represents a major driver of disability as well as health care cost. Progress in improving diagnosis and treatment of this disorder has been hindered by its heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course. Such heterogeneity makes the underlying neurobiology difficult to characterize, and has led to efforts to identify more homogeneous subgroups. These efforts date back to the dawn of the modern psychopharmacologic era - initially focused on atypical and melancholic depression, and more recently on subtypes such as anxious and irritable depression.  Subtyping efforts are complicated by a paucity of large clinical cohorts with similar ascertainment and phenotyping. In particular, the available data often focuses on a very narrow range of depressive symptoms, along with a restricted set of comorbidities, and typically encompasses only the acute phase of treatment. As a result, despite intriguing findings in one or occasionally two cohorts, subtyping has not been widely deployed in clinical practice, nor used to meaningfully improve translational investigation.  The utility of electronic health records and registries to create in silico cohort studies has been demonstrated in numerous settings, including psychiatry. Beyond sample size and efficiency of ascertainment, these data types often have advantages in the range of non-depressive phenotypes captured and availability of longitudinal data.  The present study therefore proposes to create a very large cohort of individuals with MDD, defined by a validated algorithm, spanning two health systems, and to apply novel machine learning methods to identify MDD subtypes. These subtypes will be validated by comparison with standard phenotypic definitions, annotation by trained raters using a standard 'intruder' paradigm, and correlation with medication prescribing Then, as proof of concept the biological basis of these subtypes will be characterized by examining heritability and polygenic risk using a large genetic biobank. Beyond determining convergent validity, this last step will provide proof-of-concept for broader application of data-driven subtypes for translational investigation in biobanks and registries.  The study builds on existing collaborations between a team experienced in mood disorder phenotypic and genomic study as well as application of electronic health records, and a team active in developing and applying emerging methods in machine learning. It will lay the groundwork for further validation and application of data-driven disease subtyping across medicine. Public health significance The wide variation in symptoms of major depressive disorder complicates efforts to understand the underlying causes of this illness. Applying machine learning methods to electronic health records should enable the identification of more specific disease subgroups. These subgroups will facilitate efforts to understand the causes of depression, and to begin to develop more targeted treatments.",Machine learning for data-driven subtyping of major depression,9717620,R56MH115187,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Atypical depressive disorder', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endocrine System Diseases', 'European', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Melancholic Depression', 'Mental Depression', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reactive depression', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'psychopharmacologic', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R56,2018,595755,-0.01599715847489172
"Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping ABSTRACT  Symptom-based classification approaches based on the DSM 5 are often not supported by epidemiological, genetic, and clinical neuroimaging research and may impede the advancement of interventions that target the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health disorders. A novel alternative to classifying psychopathology based on presenting clinical symptoms is to identify neurobiologically-informed biotypes. Individuals are clustered according to shared patterns of brain dysfunction using data-driven machine learning techniques to reveal the heterogeneous biological mechanisms that underlie comorbid disorders. Internalizing symptoms often first begin during development, suggesting that this is a critical period of vulnerability. Additionally, strong sex differences are found in anxiety and depressive symptoms, starting in adolescence. Thus, studies are needed that examine sex differences in the neurobiological mechanisms associated with internalizing symptoms during development. The purpose of the current study is to uncover the neurobiological heterogeneity associated with internalizing symptoms in youth. During the K99 phase, Aim 1 will use machine-learning techniques to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity among youth with anxiety and depressive disorders using multimodal neuroimaging data from a large community-based sample of over 1,200 youth studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; Training phase). We will test these heterogeneous patterns on a hold-out sample from the same cohort to examine the model’s validity (Validation phase). While the PNC provides an ideal dataset for developing a model, it does not have paradigms relevant to fear and anxiety that would allow us to identify important phenotypic differences between biotypes. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the generalizability of this model in an independent sample collected during the R00 phase, and further characterize these biotypes using pertinent measures related to error and reward processing. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate how sex differences in brain development associate with heterogeneous neural patterns in internalizing symptoms. Dr. Kaczkurkin’s long-term goal is to establish an independent research program where she will use advanced multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to study the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders in youth. This study will provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on the PNC database at the University of Pennsylvania to develop a well-validated model while also collecting a refined independent dataset, which will provide Dr. Kaczkurkin with the training and experience needed to transition to an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will provide critical knowledge regarding the neurobiological heterogeneity in youth with mood and anxiety disorders. A greater comprehension of how abnormalities in brain function give rise to these symptoms in adolescence is critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. Such knowledge would benefit public health by reducing the costs and burden of internalizing symptoms on the society at large. !",Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping,9583383,K99MH117274,"['Adolescence', 'Affective', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Atrophic', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Comprehension', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Phobias', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Societies', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'critical period', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'male', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'programs', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'reward processing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2018,109900,0.03333715329044319
"Scaling a smarter and more efficient intervention: Evaluating the feasibility of disseminating a novel mobile app platform to treat depression ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study to test the utility of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) clinical messaging tool to improve the reach and the quality (fidelity and competency) of coaches providing behavioral activation (BA) strategies through a mobile mental health app called Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivational Enhancement (PRIME). Despite decades of research and development for the treatment of mood disorders, depression has risen from the 5th leading cause of disability to the leading cause in the US. Critical barriers for progress in the field are 1) Poor access to high quality care for consumers; 2) Limited mental health workforce; and 3) Few providers are trained in the delivery of evidence-based treatments. In response to this public health problem, our team is proposing to use a mobile platform to improve access to an evidence based treatment; increase the reach of mental health coaches while supporting the delivery of higher quality of care. We will improve the reach of clinicians by using a NLP-powered messaging tool, which will ensure fidelity to the BA model and clinicians will have access to real-time clinical information about their patients to guide more targeted treatment (competence). By improving the efficiency and competence of mental health coaches in the context of mobile mental health services, we expect patients to make greater gains in depression, mood-related disability, and in achieving personal goals. In order to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, and overall impact of the enhancements to PRIME, we will spend Year 1 engaging stakeholders in a human centered iterative design process and spend Years 2-3 conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial in which we will randomize 120 individuals with depression to either receive 8- weeks of 1) PRIME 1.0 (current version) OR 2) PRIME 2.0 (version with the NLP-powered clinician dashboard). Using BRIGHTEN, our mobile clinical trial platform, we will recruit participants, consent, screen, evaluate and deliver the intervention entirely remotely. The pilot data from this study will be used to prepare for a R01 study to definitively determine whether PRIME may be used to efficiently and effectively improve outcomes for a significantly larger number of individuals with depression.

"Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment Summary: The public health burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is immense and current approaches for selecting antidepressant treatment have had limited success. By some estimates, fewer than one in three MDD patients will respond to their prescribed antidepressant and the quest for a treatment that will work is typically characterized by a lengthy course of trial-and-error. The need to identify patient characteristics (biomarkers) that can be used to objectively select personalized antidepressant treatment is clear. Accordingly, large clinical studies like the NIMH-funded Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) study have collected massive amounts of baseline measures including those from various neuroimaging sources in the hope that some can be used to guide antidepressant treatment selection. These data bring with them many statistical challenges that have yet to be effectively addressed. These challenges include (1) dealing with high-dimensionality, (2) handling data missingness, and (3) determining how best to simultaneously model relationships between measures from multiple imaging modalities and the response of interest. The goal of this project is to acquire the essential training and experience to make significant progress in this area by addressing each of these challenges. Aim 1 of this project will employ state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning algorithms and targeted estimation to identify moderators of antidepressant treatment effect using scalar clinical, demographic, and summary neuroimaging data from clinical trials of antidepressant treatments, including EMBARC. Strategies for handling missing data in this context will also be investigated and guidelines on best practices will be proposed. Aim 2 will extend the methods used in Aim 1 and develop user-friendly software to directly incorporate high- dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data into treatment decision rules. Included in this aim will be an investigation into best practices for handling missing high-dimensional imaging data in the context of estimating treatment decision rules. Aim 3 will employ the novel methods developed in Aim 2 and the estimated treatment decision rules will be evaluated and compared with those developed in Aim 1. I have put together a training program that directly supports the completion of these research aims. It includes instruction, mentoring, and hands-on-experience (1) in psychopathology and the neural basis for psychiatric disorders and treatment for those disorders; (2) in the use of neuroimaging data to understand depression and response to antidepressant treatment; (3) in the use of modern algorithms to store, process, manipulate, and analyze big biomedical data like those arising in multimodal neuroimaging studies. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the training, time, and resources to be able to make substantial progress in addressing this important problem and will provide the skills and experience that will be crucial in my transition to an independent investigator. ! Public Health Relevance Statement: This proposal seeks to advance precision medicine through the development of new statistical methods that integrate clinical, demographic, and high-dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data to estimate treatment decision rules. The proposed research and training are laid out in the context of depression but the statistical tools to be developed will be general enough for constructing treatment decision rules for a wide array of diseases using a variety of data types.

"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9544317,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Self-Administered', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'salivary assay', 'secondary analysis', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),K01,2018,164330,-0.0026218533377277012
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9612862,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,547853,0.04921409671466819
"Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities PROJECT SUMMARY  Establishing the incremental predictive validity of neuroimaging is a critical prerequisite for this technology's clinical or educational use outside of medical settings. If specific, well-validated neuroimaging tools provide little to no information above that of clinical interview or neuropsychological assessment, the use and funding of those tools should be more critically evaluated against other methods or funding priorities. If neuroimaging demonstrates unique predictive power for assessment or prediction purposes, however, it may aid in the identification of concerning developmental trajectories, the provision of early intervention, or the prediction of individuals' response to specific interventions. Preliminary data from the applicant's laboratory has demonstrated unique contributions of structural neuroimaging to individual differences in reading and attention using confirmatory structural equation modeling, but these questions have yet to be addressed using a data- driven feature-reduction approach that considers numerous types of demographic, behavioral, and brain- derived measures. This proposal focuses explicitly on structural neuroimaging as it is more easily and more consistently obtained than functional imaging in clinical and research environments, and recent findings indicate that it may even be more highly predictive of behavior than functional imaging. In light of these considerations, this proposal will utilize supervised machine learning to assess the incremental validity of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment.  The goals are this project are to (1) develop and evaluate demographic- and behavior-based predictive models of individuals' reading, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity, (2) replicate and then add neuroanatomical features to these models in order to test structural neuroimaging's incremental predictive validity, and (3) test these models' specificity and discriminant validity for measuring the intended constructs. The long-term goal of this proposal is thus to expand upon the applicant's background in individual difference analyses by developing skills in machine learning so that the incremental validity of multiple neuroimaging modalities can eventually be evaluated. The eventual development of a sufficiently validated predictive model could constitute a behavioral and/or brain-based signature that could serve, along with contextual and functional considerations, as a quantifiable alternative to clinically-based diagnoses. These methods are but first steps toward this distant but worthwhile goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite decades of studies clarifying the cognitive and neurophysiological predictors of reading and attentional abilities, we're only marginally closer to a more meaningful science of individual prediction. The proposed study will utilize machine learning techniques to test the predictive power of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment. Beyond the potential for improved prediction of individuals' reading and attentional abilities, the models developed can be easily improved upon using new and preexisting data, thereby moving our field closer to an individualized science of performance- and brain-based markers that can improve early risk identification and evaluate intervention targets.",Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities,9559419,F31HD091967,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohols', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Distant', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'demographics', 'falls', 'improved', 'inattention', 'individual response', 'insight', 'mathematical ability', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'phonological awareness', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'processing speed', 'psychologic', 'reading ability', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'tractography']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,F31,2018,36505,0.00541916095617404
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Abstract (of the Parent Award) Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. This administrative supplement proposes to add a sample of unaffected siblings (n=100, 20 per site over four years) as an additional comparison sample to the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control (HC) subjects already being studied in the parent study. These siblings will complete the same clinical, neurocognitive, and imaging measures as the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control subjects complete in the parent study.",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9689131,R01MH113250,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Netherlands', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive task', 'disability', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,213060,-0.014226154845308986
"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief.

"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,9539584,R01HD092331,"['Academia', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Crime', 'Criminology', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Family', 'Firearms', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Security', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'behavioral outcome', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'convict', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'developmental psychology', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'repeat offender', 'social', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2018,708752,0.0048387399277281355
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9564206,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,465508,0.0037277197102879543
"Diagnostic Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Dysfunctional Valence Systems in Depression and Anxiety Project Summary / Abstract Biomarkers have transformed the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions. In contrast, psychiatric biomarkers remain largely elusive, due in part to the fact that there is a weak correspondence between psychiatric diagnoses and their neurobiological substrates. This is especially true for depression and anxiety disorders, clinically heterogeneous conditions associated with abnormal reactivity to rewarding and aversive stimuli—and to the cues that predict them—and varied patterns of dysfunction in neural circuits that process positive and negative valence. This project will investigate how arousal processes interact with VS circuits to influence the anticipation and experience of rewarding and aversive stimuli in patients seeking treatment for symptoms of depression and anxiety, independent of conventional diagnostic categories. It is specifically designed to advance the goals of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Project, by focusing on four related RDoC constructs that are directly germane to this question—arousal, potential threat threat, approach motivation, and reward attainment—and testing whether they explain variation in symptoms of anxiety and anhedonia in clinical populations. Importantly, this project will also advance RDoC's goal of developing new ways of classifying mental disorders, which will ultimately require methods for identifying novel diagnostic classes linked to homogeneous pathophysiology. To this end, we will test a strategy for discovering novel diagnostic subtypes defined by clustered patterns of abnormal functional connectivity in valence system circuits. We will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to develop classifiers for diagnosing these subtypes in individual patients, and we will seek to identify distinct mechanisms by which atypical valence system reactivity may contribute to anxiety, anhedonia, and abnormal approach motivation and avoidance behavior in distinct patient subgroups, indexed in the laboratory via integrated, convergent measurements across multiple units of analysis. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and targeting treatments to the patients most likely to benefit from them. In contrast, biomarkers for psychiatric disorders remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of depression and anxiety in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific clinical profiles of anxiety, reward processing, and anxious arousal within these subtypes.",Diagnostic Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Dysfunctional Valence Systems in Depression and Anxiety,9733429,R56MH114976,"['Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Pathological anxiety', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysiology', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Stimulus', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Variant', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'approach avoidance behavior', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer therapy', 'connectome', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'negative affect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'reward processing', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R56,2018,724068,-0.010904074173798094
"Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies. Project Summary:  Mental disorders represent immense healthcare burdens. Intense efforts and resources have been devoted to developing pharmacological and behavioral treatments for mental disorders, but no universally effective treatments are available. Considerable heterogeneity exists in treatment response among individuals with mental disorders, in part because an individual patient's psychosocial characteristics and/or biomarkers are not accounted for when selecting among available treatment options. Barriers to implement personalized treatments in clinical psychiatry include a lack of evidence-based, clinically interpretable, individualized treatment rules (ITRs), a lack of power to detect treatment modiﬁers from a single study, and a lack of reproducibility for treatment rules estimated from single studies. We propose analytic solutions to tackle these barriers. Speciﬁcally, we will provide integrative machine learning methods to build powerful, yet interpretable, individualized treatment strategies that can be easily applied in clinical practice. We will integrate evidence of ITRs identiﬁed in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to increase robustness and reproducibility. In Aim 1, we will provide piece-wise linear decision trees that are trans- parent, interpretable, and that have guaranteed performance. Our decision trees will simultaneously identify the optimal treatment for a given patient (qualitative interaction) and subgroups of patients with large beneﬁt (quan- titative interaction). In Aim 2, we propose a novel integrative analysis to synthesize evidence across trials and provide an integrative ITR that improves efﬁciency and reproducibility. Our method does not require all studies to collect common sets of variables and thus allows evidence to be combined from ITRs identiﬁed in recent RCTs that collected emerging biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging measures) with earlier RCTs that focused on clinical and be- havioral markers. In response to the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to center mental health research around “dimensional psychological constructs” shared across disorders, the methods will be applied to a wide range of RCTs that recruited patients with major depressive disorder and other co-morbid mental disorders. This strategy allows examination of ITRs for constructs shared across disorders and will increase generalizability. We will apply our methods to various RCTs, including data available from the Na- tional Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness. This research will bridge approaches for personalized medicine and integrative analysis in an effort to better understand the complex interplay between biomarkers and clinical manifestations in the context of selecting the best treatments for patients with mental disorders. Project Narrative:  Treatment responses for mental disorders are inadequate and considerable heterogeneity is observed, in part because an individual patient's clinical, psychosocial, and/or biological markers are not accounted for when select- ing treatments among available options.

"Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques Project Summary / Abstract  Neuroimaging methodologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (s/fMRI) have emerged as significant predictors of substance use relapse. These neuroimaging techniques have helped provide an objective, sensitive, and predictive measure of substance use relapse propensity. As the capabilities of biological science advance, a lingering impediment to progress is the study of individual brain regions implicated in predicting substance use relapse. Important to note, individual brain regions rarely work independently; rather, such regions often work in concert, as specific networks, continually sending and receiving information to other regions, to help facilitate learning, memory, and other cognitive processes. The investigation of ICA-derived functional network connectivity between brain regions may lend incremental utility for classifying, diagnosing, and predicting substance use relapse.  Here, using the world’s largest forensic database, which includes clinical and neuropsychological measures, electrophysiological measures, functional neuroimaging, and functional network connectivity measures, the primary goal of this project will be to delineate specific risk factors predictive of eventual stimulant use relapse propensity. This will be accomplished by integrating models incorporating logistic and Cox proportional-hazard regressions, and cross-validation machine learning pattern classifiers to predict stimulant use relapse one year after institutional release with an at-risk sample of adult incarcerated offenders.  First, we will examine the potential of various clinical and neuropsychological assessment measures in predicting stimulant use relapse. Second, we will investigate the predictive utility of error-monitoring neural measures using traditional ERPs and fMRI in predicting stimulant use relapse. Third, we will apply more agnostic, data-driven methods, including ICA-derived functional network connectivity analyses of fMRI data to measure functional connectivity between brain regions involved in error-processing to predict stimulant use relapse. Ultimately, this research will lend incremental utility in the successful prediction of stimulant use relapse, providing a more sensitive and predictive measure compared to previous investigations. The ultimate goal of the proposed training fellowship is to help provide a more biologically informed taxonomy of neurocognitive deficits associated with those prone to stimulant use relapse. Project Narrative  Prevalence estimates indicate that roughly half of incarcerated offenders meet criteria for previous history of substance use disorders (SUDs) (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015), with a majority (66.7%) relapsing within three years of institutional release (Langan & Levin, 2002). Identifying specific risk factors, including neurocognitive measures involved in predicting stimulant use relapse following release from custody could lead to important insights into this high-risk sample. The research proposed here will examine brain anatomy, function and connectivity, and psychological traits using the world's largest multi- modal database of its kind from an incarcerated sample to directly aid the development of more contemporary, scientifically-validated taxonomy of the pathophysiology related to neurocognitive deficits associated with stimulant use relapse propensity.",Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques,9565939,F31DA043328,"['Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Fellowship', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Imprisonment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'New Mexico', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive process', 'court', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'hazard', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'stimulant use', 'symptomatology', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2018,27846,-0.006324481291348022
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9503781,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2018,675630,0.02114315413261179
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9428459,R01MH059929,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Exposure to', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'clinical imaging', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'information processing', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'pre-clinical', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'symptomatology', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,643008,0.02889154179422641
"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators).

"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9534942,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,36594,0.005336159011965349
"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain.

"Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support PROJECT SUMMARY Treatments for mental health conditions such as unipolar depression provide modest average benefit but have wide variation between individuals and within individuals over time. Evidence-based customized treatment protocols would improve the mental health care of many people by providing treatment recommendations for individuals that take into account potential variation because of personal characteristics such as current health status, symptoms, and response to earlier treatment. Generating customized treatment protocols requires large amounts of data, such as from networks of health systems that can link electronic health records from millions of individuals. Current statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols are limited in three important ways.  First, current approaches rely on scientists to select the patient characteristics to use to customize treatments instead of using data to find the patient characteristics that will lead to improved, customized care. Second, customized treatment protocols discovered with current statistical methods assume no unobserved differences between individuals who receive various treatment options. Third, investigators do not have ways to know if the available data contain enough information to discover and compare customized treatment protocols precisely enough to make clinical decisions. We will address these three limitations by developing new statistical tools for discovering customized treatment protocols using electronic health records data. Our research team has expertise and experience in statistics, epidemiology, and mental health care. We will integrate methods that have been successfully used in other settings to improve statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols and address these three important limitations.  We will extend machine learning tools for selecting important pieces of information to the time-varying data structure required for discovering customized treatment protocols. We will build approaches that use available knowledge about the size of unobserved differences between groups of people who received different treatments to assess how those differences change study results. By building on the math used to estimate the sample sizes needed for precision in randomized trials with complex designs, we will develop new formulas for determining how many people with a particular condition and who took a particular drug are needed in a health system to provide enough accurate information to discover customized treatment protocols.  Using data from the electronic health records of more than 15,000 patients, we will discover customized treatment protocols for depression. By improving statistical tools and addressing current limitations, our customized treatment protocols will have immediate impact for people living with unipolar depression. The statistical tools we develop will also be useful for discovering customized treatment protocols for people with a wide variety of mental health conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with mental health conditions and their health care providers often lack evidence for making choices about numerous treatment options and they do not have evidence-based, customized treatment plans. This project will develop customized treatment plans for unipolar depression and methods to generate these plans using data from electronic health care records. This work will address current limitations in statistical methods for selecting patient characteristics for customizing treatment, assessing bias from differences between people who take different medications, and calculating how many people are needed to accurately compare customized treatment plans using data from electronic health records.",Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support,9593316,R01MH114873,"['13 year old', 'Address', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'novel', 'practice setting', 'precision medicine', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,390422,-0.0030659733199937113
"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,9472495,R01MH112829,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diffusion', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Telemedicine', 'Telemental', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care costs', 'contextual factors', 'control trial', 'demographics', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'experience', 'geographic difference', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'older patient', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'rapid growth', 'rural area', 'severe mental illness', 'symposium', 'trend', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2018,698805,0.03295520804776183
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9492704,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,423903,0.03256831651381644

This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research.

By developing methods to help generalize the results of meta-analyses, we will help translate results into appropriate decisions regarding broad implementation and clinical practice.",Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis,9750373,R00MH111807,"['Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data access', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'informal learning', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open data', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'working group']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R00,2018,249000,0.003792713739766607
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychopathology arising from a disruption of emotional function affects over 400 million people globally, yet we lack a neurobiological model to guide classification and treatment. We propose to use Human Connectome Project protocols to develop and disseminate a brain network model of disordered emotional states.",Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states,9530685,U01MH109985,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Down-Regulation', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Human', 'Image', 'Insula of Reil', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positive Valence', 'Precentral gyrus', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Reaction', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'aged', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive system', 'cohesion', 'connectome', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'disability', 'disability burden', 'emotional experience', 'executive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'hedonic', 'high dimensionality', 'human imaging', 'incentive salience', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'network dysfunction', 'network models', 'outcome prediction', 'physical symptom', 'predict clinical outcome', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'treatment choice', 'white matter']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,771712,-0.0051463100689395054
"Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity Project Summary Prescription opioids, e.g., oxycodone (OXY), are commonly encountered in youth and pose a significant public health problem. In addition, there are significant individual differences in subjective responses to opioids which contribute to vulnerabilities for misuse. However, little is understood about OXY's effects on brain function, or on how individual differences in these effects might relate to variations in subjective responses. Assessment of OXY's effects on brain function is critical to understanding its abuse liability a n d will provide insight into how and why this drug leads to misuse and abuse/dependence in some, but not all, individuals. This proposal will assess the effects of low-dose OXY (10mg) on whole-brain functional connectivity (FC), and explore relationships with subjective responses in healthy young adults (ages 21 to 30 years, N=40) with limited prior opioid exposure. OXY's effects on FC during both reward- processing and resting-state will be assessed using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design incorporating multiband fMRI scanning. Subjective measures of drug response (e.g., `drug liking') will be collected before, during and after neuroimaging using NIDA PhenX measures. Neuroimaging data will be analyzed using data-driven methods to facilitate assessment of OXY's effects on FC both within hypothesized networks (e.g., salience and reward networks) as well as on patterns of between- network connectivity. Specifically, FC changes following OXY versus placebo (Aim 1) and relationships between these changes and subjective drug responses (Aim 2) will be assessed using intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD). ICD is a data-driven, voxel-to-voxel method of assessing whole-brain connectivity patterns that is not limited by specification of seed regions or connectivity thresholds. In addition, connectome-based machine-learning will be used to build a predictive model of subjective responses to OXY using data acquired during placebo scans (Aim 3). This project will for the first time assess the effects of a prescription opioid on whole-brain FC. Understanding OXY's effects on large-scale network dynamics is crucial for understanding its abuse liability, and will guide future studies of OXY in addicted and at-risk populations. Identification of networks that are predictive of subjective responses to OXY is an essential first step toward finding a reliable biomarker of opioid response that will help to identify individuals at highest risk for misuse. Project Narrative Prescription opioids are commonly encountered and, in a small proportion of individuals, may be a precursor to heroin initiation. This project will assess the effects of low-dose oxycodone (10mg) on brain function in healthy young adults (age 21 to 30 years). It will identify brain-based predictors of subjective opioid responses (`neural fingerprints') that can be used to inform prevention and intervention efforts.",Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity,9507053,R21DA045969,"['21 year old', 'Abstinence', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Cocaine', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Heroin', 'Heroin Users', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'Link', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Morphine', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurocognitive', 'Opioid', 'Oxycodone', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Spin Labels', 'System', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'connectome', 'executive function', 'financial incentive', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid misuse', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,209375,-0.015694934390901204
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9534190,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,668364,-0.007808200928685004
"Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures,9505794,K99MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive signature', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2018,128072,-0.0002970136429897388
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9538116,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,679633,-0.019239887338624116
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on the effects of adolescent marijuana use on working memory, inhibitory control and corticostriatal systems.",ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project,9509388,U01DA041028,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent marijuana use', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'behavioral health', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'time use', 'translational research program', 'trend']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2018,990000,0.034653767419793084
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9593182,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Generic Drugs', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,466099,-0.02868591116949783
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,9444775,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discount', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,735735,0.024296254315233325
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9568804,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,622284,-0.008888468636699239
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

"Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression Project Summary/Abstract Depression is the most common complication of pregnancy and affects 10-20% of women. Up to 75% of women with perinatal depression do not receive mental health care. In lower income African American and Hispanic women, the prevalence of perinatal depression (PND) is particularly high and the treatment rates are lower. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment but practical barriers such as time commitment, insurance coverage, and transportation, as well as stigma, limit uptake of CBT particularly for minority women. Similarly, concern about the adverse effects of antidepressant treatment on maternal and infant outcomes limits uptake of pharmacological treatments. A novel avenue for the development of safe therapeutics for depression focuses on the brain-gut axis and is supported by initial demonstrations that probiotics can improve mood symptoms. Our long-term goal is to assist in the discovery of potential microbes that are correlated with PND, and could be novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, particularly in minority women. As a first step, we propose a multi-PI feasibility study involving the implementation and optimization of processes for participant recruitment and stool sample collection, as well as the initial assessments of longitudinal differences in gut microbiota between pregnant women with and without major depressive disorder (MDD). To meet these goals, we will leverage an established research infrastructure to conduct a prospective, nested case-control study. We will prospectively collect depression diagnoses and gut microbiome samples on 300 women at four points during pregnancy and after delivery to yield a total of 58 women, 29 cases with MDD and 29 controls without MDD. The two groups will be matched on key covariates (e.g., age, race, socio- economic status, gestational age, health). At their scheduled usual care, prenatal appointment, consented participants will complete mental health, demographics, microbiome-related, and dietary and physical habits questionnaires and provide a fecal sample either at that time of their appointment or at home. To achieve our first aim - to determine the feasibility of a larger similarly designed study - we will estimate the total number of potential participants, the number assessed and not assessed for eligibility (and reasons), the number excluded and reasons for exclusion, the number lost to follow-up, and the data available for analysis at each of the 4 visits. To achieve our second aim - to determine whether the gut microbiome dynamically differs in pregnant women with and without MDD - we will employ a suite of systems level approaches, including multivariate statistical techniques, network modeling and machine learning techniques. This R03 will allow us to optimize our research processes for the prospective collection of stool samples and mental health data in preparation for larger nested case-control studies, and ultimately clinical trials of probiotic therapies for PND. Project Narrative Up to 75% of women diagnosed with depression during pregnancy and the postpartum receive inadequate treatment, in large part due to concerns about the safety of antidepressants. Here we propose a feasibility study in preparation for a larger study to determine whether women with depression during their pregnancy and after their delivery have alterations in the bacterial communities in their intestine. Identifying which bacteria are associated with depression is a critical first step in the development of safe probiotic treatments for depression during pregnancy. !",Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression,9507031,R03HD095056,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Appointment', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Endocrine system', 'Epidemiology', 'Exclusion', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feces', 'Germ-Free', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nutritional', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'antepartum depression', 'antidepressant effect', 'bacterial community', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'drug development', 'dysbiosis', 'effective therapy', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal transplantation', 'follow-up', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'health data', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'maternal stress', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microorganism', 'mood symptom', 'network models', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'nutrition', 'perinatal mental health', 'peripartum depression', 'probiotic therapy', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample collection', 'social stigma', 'stool sample', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment as usual', 'uptake']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R03,2018,92360,0.024193611503574124
"Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions ABSTRACT Bullying is a preventable public health problem that can have long-lasting health, academic and social consequences. Bullying affects between 18% and 31% of adolescents and has been associated with serious negative consequences including depression, substance use, and academic failure for both the perpetrator and target. Over the past decade, bullying behavior has expanded into the digital realm and is known as cyberbullying. Cyberbullying stories have had frequent coverage by news organizations, including coverage of teens whose death from suicide was attributed to cyberbullying. Previous work illustrates the influence of news stories on individual’s attitudes and experiences. News organization coverage has been influential to readers in areas such as suicide, infectious disease outbreaks such as H1N1 flu, and tobacco use. Little is known whether and how adolescents and their families perceive or utilize news coverage of bullying or cyberbullying. News media may be an untapped resource to promote bullying prevention messages and strategies. Our long- term goal is to develop and test interventions to improve bullying prevention and intervention efforts working with media. Towards that goal, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news organization coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families. First, we will evaluate youth and parent perspectives on lay media coverage of bullying using qualitative interviews with 50 participants: 25 diverse adolescents age 15-18 years and 25 parent/guardians of these adolescents. Second, we will assess the current state of the narrative in news media coverage of bullying. We will identify a sample of 500 news articles from print/online media that cover bullying over the past 5 years and conduct content analysis using natural language processing. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software we will evaluate the proportion of words that represent fear-based reporting such as alarmist words (e.g. epidemic, tragic), as well as words that represent public health-oriented messages such as prevention. We will also compare news coverage of bullying to cyberbullying. After analyzing data from these two aims, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 journalists. Our third aim is to synthesize these findings and identify strategies for future interventions that are feasible and acceptable to journalists. We will work with 3 consultants from the fields of communication and journalism to identify and engage journalists (n=30) in qualitative interviews. When these interconnected study aims are successfully completed, outcomes will include a comprehensive understanding of how adolescents and their parents understand and utilize news coverage of bullying, the current state of bullying and cyberbullying news coverage narrative, and perspectives of journalists on intervention approaches that are feasible and acceptable. We will utilize these findings towards novel intervention approaches, such as to leverage news coverage towards enhancing prevention of bullying. PROJECT NARRATIVE Previous studies have shown that news media coverage of health issues can change attitudes and behaviors; for example, journalists’ approach to suicide can have significant impact on bereaved families and at-risk youth. News media can also complement public health efforts, such as through coverage of tobacco harms that have been shown to prevent smoking among adolescents. Bullying is a significant public health issues that can lead to short and long-term health effects and is frequently covered by news media; thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families towards developing future interventions.",Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions,9551054,R21HD090221,"['Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemic', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Priorities', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Influentials', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Journalism', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoking', 'Suicide', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'bullying', 'bullying prevention', 'contagion', 'cyberbullying', 'digital', 'experience', 'flu', 'health organization', 'improved', 'news', 'novel', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'sexual minority', 'social', 'social stigma', 'success', 'suicidal morbidity']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2018,184819,-0.10665596612901801
"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9545867,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2018,117680,0.0029636707527940257
"Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health Symptoms in Youth ABSTRACT Only slightly more than half (55%) of 4-17 year olds with significant mental health difficulties receive treatment. These are often not initiated until issues are significantly impacting the child and family. Nearly half of children with known mental health disorders and up to 80% of children with sub-clinical symptoms receive no treatment. This study aims to (a) develop methods based on electronic medical records data to identify early mental health needs in children 4-17 years of age and (b) conduct a pragmatic randomized trial in two non-academic health care systems to test a mental health family navigator model to promote early access to, engagement in, and coordination of needed mental health services for children and adolescence. Phase 1 of the study would focus on the development and refinement of a natural language processing (NLP) tool to identify symptomatic 4-17 year olds with no diagnosed mental health disorder(s). The tool would identify patients with documentation of mental health symptoms or complaints in the free text of a progress note from a recent primary care or urgent care visit. Phase 2 of the study would focus on conducting a pragmatic randomized trial comparing intervention and usual care arm patients enrolled from Kaiser Permanente (KP) Washington and KP Northern California. The trial will enroll 200 patients per arm (n=400). The navigator model to be implemented and tested will include three groups based on recent visits recorded in the electronic health record. Those with: (1) a new mental health diagnosis; (2) new mental health medication ordered, no mental health diagnosis; (3) no new mental health diagnosis or medication (symptoms identified by NLP tool). The study intervention will offer 6 months of support to the family by a mental health navigator (social worker). The navigator will perform an initial needs and barriers assessment with the family around mental health services, conduct ongoing motivational interviewing around mental health care, provide up to 4 bridging psychotherapy sessions (when appropriate) via clinic-to-home video visits, help the family find and schedule with appropriate mental health providers in the community, reach out ad hoc if mental health appointments or medication refills are missed, stay in contact with the family for 6 months. The primary outcome is percentage of youth with at least 4 psychotherapy visits in the 6 months following the initial visit. The secondary outcome is the percentage of youth with >=80% medication adherence over the 6 month follow up period. We hypothesize that the intervention arm will have higher rates of psychotherapy use and medication adherence compared to the control arm. We will also assess medication adjustments, initiation of psychotherapy or medications, and (intervention arm only) change in self-efficacy in navigating the mental health care system over 6 months. All primary analyses will follow an intent-to-treat approach.

"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9568354,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2018,58654,0.03410662152778567
"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of “non-monotone” missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ﬂawed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ﬁxed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiﬁc domains, making “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiﬁc reporting.

We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiﬁc reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9576900,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,543369,0.019299111987991342
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9501776,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,483815,0.01146128353773588
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder(MDD), bipolar disorders(BD) and schizophrenia(SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason lies in that most neuroimaging “prediction” studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple “correlation” relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, or lack of multi-site validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with references, and sparse regression etc. can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, which can be promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers, which goes beyond a more descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain diseases. We will develop 3 novel data- driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment(in SZ) or epigenetic factors (miR-132 dysregulation in MDD) may affect covarying brain function and structure, which uses different clinical measures as reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction model that is able to identify imaging biomarkers for precise, individualized prediction of clinical outcomes, e.g., remission status of MDD patients after Electroconvulsive Treatment(ECT). 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep neural networks(DNN) combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), to classify multiple group of psychiatric disorders by using functional connectivity measures, and to trace back the most predictive functional networks from the black box of deep learning by LRP. All above proposed methods will be applied to the big data containing multimodal imaging and behavioral information(n=5000) pooled from existing studies, to investigate biomarkers that can help solve specific clinical difficulties. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, lead to earlier and more effective interventions, suggesting a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep neural networks, supervised learning and dynamic functional information, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, thus identify replicable and precise biomarkers that are able to predict individual clinical measures and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting a large imaging and behavioral dataset (n~5000) to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9733448,R56MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'CREB1 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R56,2018,453304,0.005544335889713743
"Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and difﬁculties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speciﬁc brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speciﬁc behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ﬁrst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ﬁnding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care. A primary goal of this project is to create open-source software that is used by the neuroscience community to advance research in understanding the brain basis of behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders. Project Narrative This grant is focused on developing novel analysis of complex brain networks from structural and functional imaging and using this to link brain features to behavioral phenotypes. These algorithms will be used to discover brain biomarkers of behavioral traits in Autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders.","Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes",9546678,R01EB022876,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Phenotype', 'Population Control', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain shape', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'individual variation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'social', 'trait']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,381250,-0.021377716369483414
"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,9470566,R01MH114028,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Paraphilias', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'aggression prevention', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data structure', 'early childhood', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'mental state', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'pediatric trauma', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2018,754642,-0.006095376858791138
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9487760,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,1272933,0.005902513950639222
"Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal responds to RFA-MH-17-612, “Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34).” We have shown in several randomized trials that family-focused therapy (FFT) for symptomatic youth at high-risk for bipolar disorder - consisting of psychoeducation and family communication and problem solving skills training - is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in hastening symptomatic recovery. However, between 50%-60% of high-risk youth still have residual mood symptoms and functional impairment after 18 weeks of FFT. In our prior studies, two constructs have emerged as predictors of lack of response to treatment: mood instability in the child and expressed emotion (EE) in parents (i.e., frequent critical comments or hostility). In adolescents (ages 12-18) with a parent with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, we hypothesize that augmenting FFT with frequent and targeted interventions in the home setting through a Smartphone app (MyCoachConnect, or MCC) will (a) have a greater and more rapid impact than standard FFT on the targeted mechanisms of mood instability in adolescents and EE in parents, and (b) as a result, enhance symptom resolution and functioning in adolescents. To be eligible, adolescents must score high on parent-rated measures of mood instability, and have at least one parent who is high-EE by speech sample coding criteria. The MCC app will record weekly open speech samples from parents and children and daily and weekly mood ratings from adolescents. The app assessments will be fed back to the FFT clinician, who will use this information to “push” recommendations for mood regulation, communication, and problem-solving strategies (linked to the FFT modules) for parents and youth. In year 1, we will conduct an open trial (n=25) to determine (a) the feasibility and acceptability of FFT with mobile coaching (FFT-MCC), as given by clinicians in community settings, and (b) associations between online/speech feature proxies of the targets (mood instability and EE as measured weekly by MCC) and standard measures of the targets. In years 2 and 3 we will conduct a 75- case RCT in which families are assigned to FFT with MCC skills coaching, FFT with MCC assessments only, with no coaching; or FFT Only, without MCC. We hypothesize that FFT-MCC will be acceptable to parents, adolescents and clinicians, and more effective than FFT without MCC coaching or FFT-Only in engaging the targets of mood instability and EE and promoting improvements in adolescents' mood symptoms and quality of life over 27 weeks. The study will facilitate the translation of a technological augmentation to an evidence-based family intervention, with the goal of increasing treatment access among families with mood disorders. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a 12-session evidence- based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC “real time” assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills. We hypothesize that the augmented version of FFT (FFT-MCC) will be more effective than FFT without coaching/informational alerts in altering treatment targets and in stabilizing youths' mood symptoms and quality of life.",Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders,9587465,R34MH117200,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Back', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Family', 'Family Relationship', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Hostility', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'community setting', 'effectiveness trial', 'emerging adult', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'girls', 'high risk', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'mobile application', 'mood regulation', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'psychoeducation', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'skills training', 'smartphone Application', 'standard measure', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy design', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'usability', 'volunteer']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R34,2018,195000,-0.006988574399071079
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal.

"Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders Project Summary: Early life psychosocial adversity and stress are well-established as the most powerful environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children. Impairments in developing emotion regulation and cognitive control and associated alterations in brain development have been shown to mediate the effects of adversity on risk for the development of psychopathology. Early psychosocial adversity impacts the epigenetic and inflammation-mediated processes that contribute to these negative outcomes, a process known as “biological embedding of stress.” While this risk trajectory has been clearly linked to increased rates of psychopathology, the mechanisms of this process, its targetable mediators and how early in development they operate are yet to be determined. Here we focus on the effects of early life adversity on brain, emotion regulation and cognitive control outcomes relevant to risk for mental disorders, beginning antenatally and extending to age 3. We will examine the role of pre- and postnatal adversity/stress, the maternal and child perinatal gut microbiome and early caregiver support on these key neurodevelopmental outcomes utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging. Our unifying hypothesis is that these factors modulate systemic inflammatory responses, induce neuronal effects through this and other processes that adversely impact brain development in limbic and cortical regions, and mediate the effects of early adversity on child emotion regulation, cognitive control and mental health outcomes. These factors will be studied in a unique, prospectively ascertained cohort of 370 mothers and their offspring at high psychosocial risk being recruited as part of an already funded March of Dimes project at Washington University. The cohort will include both term- and prematurely-born infants and toddlers given the increased risk of psychosocial adversity and aberrant gut microbiome in preterm children. The offspring will be intensively prospectively studied from the 1st trimester to age 3, providing a unique dataset in which to examine the interrelationships among pre- and postnatal adversity, biomarkers of inflammation, the gut microbiome and developmental and mental health outcomes. The perinatal and early childhood periods are critical times to study these exposures as adverse neurodevelopment associated with adversity begins in utero through fetal programming. Likewise, the perinatal period is a critical developmental window for microbial influences, when gut microbial colonization has its most enduring effects. The proposed study merges established research groups in these areas in a center with advanced infant and childhood neuroimaging and extensive microbiome expertise, and offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand the mechanisms of the biological embedding of adversity on brain, cognitive and emotional trajectories in a high-risk cohort. We will also apply innovative computational methods, using Deep Learning, to extend understanding of these data. Findings will provide critical and novel insights to inform early preventive interventions relevant to emotional, cognitive and mental health outcomes for children at greatest risk. Project Narrative This study will investigate the mechanisms by which psychosocial adversity experienced in utero and early in life impact the child’s brain, cognitive and emotional development, testing the hypothesis that stress and adversity during pregnancy adversely affect early brain development through inflammatory mechanisms. Another important focus of this project is to examine how the maternal perinatal microbiome and infant’s gut microbiome during early childhood impact brain development, either through the infant’s inflammatory response or other effects. A third focus is to explore the effects of caregiver support on this risk trajectory, testing the idea that high caregiver support reduces the negative influences of early adversity, altered immune biomarkers and disruptions in the gut microbiome.","Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders",9518320,R01MH113883,"['3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caregiver support', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Funding', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informal Social Control', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mothers', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Poverty', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'antenatal', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'gray matter', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiome', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal period', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,1996238,0.013457563395094489
"The Center for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NEUROMAP) Project Summary Mood and anxiety disorders will account for approximately $16 x 109 lost productivity or 25% of global GDP over the next 20 years. Eating disorders are among the deadliest psychiatric diseases and Anorexia Nervosa is two to three times more deadly than schizophrenia, bipolar and major depressive disorder.

"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9568765,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multitask', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'premature neonates', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,392718,-0.016313932531213455
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language. Under Aim 2 we will develop the technical means to integrate the ontology in a web service infrastructure. Aim 3 is to create the infrastructure to be used by those seeking and those providing trauma care assessment and to enable comparison of organizational structures of trauma care environments. In the process of comparing organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems, data will be collected from the user and stored in our data repository. Thus, while running the service, we will also be creating a data source about organization of trauma centers and trauma systems, which we will make available to those conducting comparative research on the impact of organizational structures of trauma care facilities on patient outcomes under Aim 4. The interrelation between organizational structures and patient outcome is known in the public health literature, but we lack tools to explore its effects on trauma care environments in a computer-assisted manner; our project will provide an IT framework resolving this lack. It will contribute to information and knowledge processing, advanced information retrieval, and incorporation of machine intelligence into decision processes. By providing a common schema, it will also contribute to the integration of heterogeneous data types. Our project will impact the work of organizations that assess, verify, or designate trauma care environments, as well as organizations interested in self-assessing their own organization. Supporting comparison of these organizations will not only affect assessment or certification but also add to the comparability of patient outcome data by linking it to specific organizational components. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop an IT framework accessible on the Internet that facilitates and optimizes verification of trauma centers and consultation of trauma systems and fosters comparability between trauma care environments with different organizational structures and under different legislations. Making these structures more comparable will not only benefit those who provide verification or consultation to trauma care environments, it will also allow organizations unable to acquire assessment through third parties to do in-house assessments based on data collected through best-practice assessments for the benefits of the patients. In providing these services, our framework will collect data on the organization trauma care environments, and our framework will make that data available for researchers interested in comparative studies.",Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care,9422711,R01GM111324,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Imagery', 'Information Retrieval', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organizational Models', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Assessment', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Violence', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'data access', 'data management', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'organizational structure', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'tool', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2018,253856,0.02841737424679913

"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9272937,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2017,186993,-0.005409325619097932
"Scaling a smarter and more efficient intervention: Evaluating the feasibility of disseminating a novel mobile app platform to treat depression ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study to test the utility of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) clinical messaging tool to improve the reach and the quality (fidelity and competency) of coaches providing behavioral activation (BA) strategies through a mobile mental health app called Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivational Enhancement (PRIME). Despite decades of research and development for the treatment of mood disorders, depression has risen from the 5th leading cause of disability to the leading cause in the US. Critical barriers for progress in the field are 1) Poor access to high quality care for consumers; 2) Limited mental health workforce; and 3) Few providers are trained in the delivery of evidence-based treatments. In response to this public health problem, our team is proposing to use a mobile platform to improve access to an evidence based treatment; increase the reach of mental health coaches while supporting the delivery of higher quality of care. We will improve the reach of clinicians by using a NLP-powered messaging tool, which will ensure fidelity to the BA model and clinicians will have access to real-time clinical information about their patients to guide more targeted treatment (competence). By improving the efficiency and competence of mental health coaches in the context of mobile mental health services, we expect patients to make greater gains in depression, mood-related disability, and in achieving personal goals. In order to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, and overall impact of the enhancements to PRIME, we will spend Year 1 engaging stakeholders in a human centered iterative design process and spend Years 2-3 conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial in which we will randomize 120 individuals with depression to either receive 8- weeks of 1) PRIME 1.0 (current version) OR 2) PRIME 2.0 (version with the NLP-powered clinician dashboard). Using BRIGHTEN, our mobile clinical trial platform, we will recruit participants, consent, screen, evaluate and deliver the intervention entirely remotely. The pilot data from this study will be used to prepare for a R01 study to definitively determine whether PRIME may be used to efficiently and effectively improve outcomes for a significantly larger number of individuals with depression.

If successful, PRIME could operate as a cost effective tool for clinicians to extend their reach and an accessible treatment for the population of those struggling with depression.",Scaling a smarter and more efficient intervention: Evaluating the feasibility of disseminating a novel mobile app platform to treat depression,9323599,R34MH110583,"['Behavioral', 'Case Mixes', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Competency', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Services', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'arm', 'base', 'blind', 'care seeking', 'cost effective', 'dashboard', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'novel', 'post intervention', 'research and development', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'targeted treatment', 'technological innovation', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R34,2017,244732,-0.01713503817647672
"Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I aim to identify a data-driven taxonomy of depression and anxiety from multiple neurobiological measures of brain function, physiology and behavior that is not constrained by existing diagnostic boundaries. Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder are highly prevalent and together cost over $100 billion per year in care and lost productivity. While the symptoms used in the diagnosis of these disorders convey useful information and reflect real phenomenology, the way in which symptoms are grouped makes for ""fuzzy"" diagnostic boundaries, with substantial symptom overlap across disorders, yet vast symptom heterogeneity within. Moreover, experiments aiming to identify the neural contribution to dysfunction have been intrinsically tied to these traditional diagnostic categories As a consequence, we do not have a clear understanding of how the neural circuitry underlying depression and anxiety relates to the expressed symptoms at the level of physiology and behavior, independent from these traditional diagnoses. These blurry diagnostic lines hamper our progress toward understanding the mechanisms of dysfunction and developing novel, targeted therapeutics. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish a complementary characterization of anxiety and depression that reflects cohesive clusters of distinct neural causes. Addressing these issues I propose to use a data driven approach to develop an alternate classification for depression and anxiety. Under Aim 1 I will use computational methods on a rich existing dataset of over 600 participants, to derive dimensional constructs of emotion processing from neuroimaging probes of emotion reactivity and regulation and determine how these constructs are associated with other levels of function spanning behavior, physiology and self-report. Under Aim 2 I will use sparse clustering algorithms to classify individual subjects according to the neuroimaging constructs and then determine how each classification is expressed across behavioral, physiological and self-report symptom measures, independent of traditional diagnosis. To address Aim 3 I will use experimental stress probes to parse state versus trait-like components of the relationships between neuroimaging and each other unit of measurement. The outcome will be a novel classification that will advance our progress toward both understanding the mechanisms of neural dysfunction in depression and anxiety as well as developing novel therapeutics for targeting such dysfunction. Critically, the proposed multi-modal approach utilizes unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify the underlying patterns within this complex system in a manner that is free from the assumptions of the current diagnostic paradigms. The resulting characterization from this approach will provide a dimensional space to understand the natural variation in neural circuit function and how this variation relates to each person's functional phenotype. Such a characterization will be a significant step forward in transforming the way that depression and anxiety are understood, removing stigma, and allowing novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder, which are among the most frequently occurring psychiatric conditions and are associated with serious personal and societal cost, are still defined by a set of descriptive symptoms that are ignorant to the underlying neurobiology. This proposal uses advanced computational methods to identify an alternative, yet complementary, model of depression and anxiety directly linked to brain function, physiology and behavior. The resulting characterization would provide a novel, biologically based dimensional space to understand an individual's symptom profile, transform the way the way that depression and anxiety are understood and allow novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.            ",Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression,9402671,F32MH108299,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stress', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohesion', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experimental study', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'phenomenological models', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social stigma', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,237,0.02164257294325811
"Building Multistage Treatment Regimens for Depression after Acute Coronary SyndromeSyndrome Building Multistage Treatment Policy for Depression after Acute Coronary Syndrome Project Summary Depression is not only commonly observed among patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but also has been shown to increase risks for recurrent ACS and mortality. Despite its high prevalence and serious impact, management of post-ACS depression remains poor because of ineciencies in depression screen- ing, limited treatment options of depression after ACS, and lack of e ective procedure if initial treatment fails. To address these issues, clinical researchers have tried to develop personalized stepped care procedures for post-ACS depression patients; this involves o ering patients the choice of receiving psychotherapy and/or antidepressant treatment and adjusting treatment as needed. The treatment decisions are usually based on patient demographics, treatment preference, medical history, progress of disease, and comorbid conditions. With the development of modern technologies, the number of available treatments increases, and more pa- tient information are collected in clinical research. Thus excavating useful information for treatment decisions is becoming more challenging. In this project, we propose to develop a principled way to construct simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional data, that can be used to guide treatment selection throughout the course of the disease. Aim 1 of the project is devoted to the development of vari- able selection methodology for constructing multistage treatment policies using statistical machine learning techniques. The proposed research seeks to incorporate the popular variable selection technique (LASSO) into existing treatment policy search approaches, namely Q-learning and A-Learning, for developing optimal treatment policies and for identifying patient response status to initial treatment { an important factor for tailoring treatment in the subsequent stages. Aim 2 evaluates the proposed methods, applies the methods to post-ACS depression data, and addresses some computational challenges. Statistical research in this area has been focused on the development of evidence-based treatment policies using pre-chosen models and variables; few if any discuss how to select models or variables in a principled way. The proposed work aims to ll this gap in methodology using modern machine learning techniques. Project Narratives The proposed research aims to answer the following question:\How to excavate simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional, longitudinal medical data in a principled way?""

"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9335456,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reading', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Self-Administered', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'salivary assay', 'secondary analysis', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),K01,2017,166910,-0.0026218533377277012
"Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities PROJECT SUMMARY  Establishing the incremental predictive validity of neuroimaging is a critical prerequisite for this technology's clinical or educational use outside of medical settings. If specific, well-validated neuroimaging tools provide little to no information above that of clinical interview or neuropsychological assessment, the use and funding of those tools should be more critically evaluated against other methods or funding priorities. If neuroimaging demonstrates unique predictive power for assessment or prediction purposes, however, it may aid in the identification of concerning developmental trajectories, the provision of early intervention, or the prediction of individuals' response to specific interventions. Preliminary data from the applicant's laboratory has demonstrated unique contributions of structural neuroimaging to individual differences in reading and attention using confirmatory structural equation modeling, but these questions have yet to be addressed using a data- driven feature-reduction approach that considers numerous types of demographic, behavioral, and brain- derived measures. This proposal focuses explicitly on structural neuroimaging as it is more easily and more consistently obtained than functional imaging in clinical and research environments, and recent findings indicate that it may even be more highly predictive of behavior than functional imaging. In light of these considerations, this proposal will utilize supervised machine learning to assess the incremental validity of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment.  The goals are this project are to (1) develop and evaluate demographic- and behavior-based predictive models of individuals' reading, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity, (2) replicate and then add neuroanatomical features to these models in order to test structural neuroimaging's incremental predictive validity, and (3) test these models' specificity and discriminant validity for measuring the intended constructs. The long-term goal of this proposal is thus to expand upon the applicant's background in individual difference analyses by developing skills in machine learning so that the incremental validity of multiple neuroimaging modalities can eventually be evaluated. The eventual development of a sufficiently validated predictive model could constitute a behavioral and/or brain-based signature that could serve, along with contextual and functional considerations, as a quantifiable alternative to clinically-based diagnoses. These methods are but first steps toward this distant but worthwhile goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite decades of studies clarifying the cognitive and neurophysiological predictors of reading and attentional abilities, we're only marginally closer to a more meaningful science of individual prediction. The proposed study will utilize machine learning techniques to test the predictive power of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment. Beyond the potential for improved prediction of individuals' reading and attentional abilities, the models developed can be easily improved upon using new and preexisting data, thereby moving our field closer to an individualized science of performance- and brain-based markers that can improve early risk identification and evaluate intervention targets.",Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities,9327290,F31HD091967,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohols', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Distant', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'demographics', 'falls', 'improved', 'inattention', 'insight', 'mathematical ability', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'phonological awareness', 'predictive modeling', 'processing speed', 'psychologic', 'reading ability', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'tractography']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,F31,2017,35797,0.00541916095617404
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders.

"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth.

"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research.

Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9405530,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2017,680002,0.02114315413261179
"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This large-scale study will advance the field by studying these different outcomes at their most basic functional level, and by identifying the biological mechanisms through which these specific types of distress and dysfunction develop.",Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes,9357691,U01MH110925,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Department evaluation', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychophysics', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'biobehavior', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'molecular marker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'response', 'success', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2017,4969685,-0.004199366424385127
"Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques Project Summary / Abstract  Neuroimaging methodologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (s/fMRI) have emerged as significant predictors of substance use relapse. These neuroimaging techniques have helped provide an objective, sensitive, and predictive measure of substance use relapse propensity. As the capabilities of biological science advance, a lingering impediment to progress is the study of individual brain regions implicated in predicting substance use relapse. Important to note, individual brain regions rarely work independently; rather, such regions often work in concert, as specific networks, continually sending and receiving information to other regions, to help facilitate learning, memory, and other cognitive processes. The investigation of ICA-derived functional network connectivity between brain regions may lend incremental utility for classifying, diagnosing, and predicting substance use relapse.  Here, using the world’s largest forensic database, which includes clinical and neuropsychological measures, electrophysiological measures, functional neuroimaging, and functional network connectivity measures, the primary goal of this project will be to delineate specific risk factors predictive of eventual stimulant use relapse propensity. This will be accomplished by integrating models incorporating logistic and Cox proportional-hazard regressions, and cross-validation machine learning pattern classifiers to predict stimulant use relapse one year after institutional release with an at-risk sample of adult incarcerated offenders.  First, we will examine the potential of various clinical and neuropsychological assessment measures in predicting stimulant use relapse. Second, we will investigate the predictive utility of error-monitoring neural measures using traditional ERPs and fMRI in predicting stimulant use relapse. Third, we will apply more agnostic, data-driven methods, including ICA-derived functional network connectivity analyses of fMRI data to measure functional connectivity between brain regions involved in error-processing to predict stimulant use relapse. Ultimately, this research will lend incremental utility in the successful prediction of stimulant use relapse, providing a more sensitive and predictive measure compared to previous investigations. The ultimate goal of the proposed training fellowship is to help provide a more biologically informed taxonomy of neurocognitive deficits associated with those prone to stimulant use relapse. Project Narrative  Prevalence estimates indicate that roughly half of incarcerated offenders meet criteria for previous history of substance use disorders (SUDs) (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015), with a majority (66.7%) relapsing within three years of institutional release (Langan & Levin, 2002). Identifying specific risk factors, including neurocognitive measures involved in predicting stimulant use relapse following release from custody could lead to important insights into this high-risk sample. The research proposed here will examine brain anatomy, function and connectivity, and psychological traits using the world's largest multi- modal database of its kind from an incarcerated sample to directly aid the development of more contemporary, scientifically-validated taxonomy of the pathophysiology related to neurocognitive deficits associated with stimulant use relapse propensity.",Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques,9394654,F31DA043328,"['Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Fellowship', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Imprisonment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'New Mexico', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive process', 'court', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'hazard', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2017,31856,-0.006324481291348022
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9251907,R01MH059929,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Exposure to', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'clinical imaging', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'information processing', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'pre-clinical', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'symptomatology', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,653164,0.02889154179422641
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9396350,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2017,35844,0.005336159011965349
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9281088,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,435678,0.03256831651381644
"Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis Dr. Hwanhee Hong is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development. Dr. Hong will also use all available resources from other Departments including biostatistics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. This environment maximizes the potential for Dr. Hong to obtain the necessary training and perform the research to establish herself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program. This project will help mental health researchers generalize, apply, and implement findings from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials to target populations. Traditional meta-analyses enable us to borrow strength across multiple studies to gain more power, resulting in reliable and precise effect estimates; however they do not consider how well the trials represent target populations of interest. By developing methods to help generalize the results of meta-analyses, we will help translate results into appropriate decisions regarding broad implementation and clinical practice.",Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis,9385505,K99MH111807,"['Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data access', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'informal learning', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open data', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'working group']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2017,110318,0.003792713739766607
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9316197,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Compulsive Behavior', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749730,-0.007808200928685004
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychopathology arising from a disruption of emotional function affects over 400 million people globally, yet we lack a neurobiological model to guide classification and treatment.

"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9384304,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opiates', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,704051,-0.019239887338624116
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9469790,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,613948,-0.008888468636699239
"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",9321191,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'CNR2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Sociology', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'traumatic event', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2017,165886,0.016258329919510855
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on negative reinforcement mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high SUD prevalence, and illicit drug and prescription medication misuse among adolescents.",ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project,9281709,U01DA041089,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brain health', 'brain research', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'design', 'drug misuse', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'longitudinal analysis', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'modifiable risk', 'multimodality', 'named group', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'prospective', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stimulus processing', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'trend']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2017,2746804,0.039899171425982864
"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9386536,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2017,118352,0.0029636707527940257
"Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions ABSTRACT Bullying is a preventable public health problem that can have long-lasting health, academic and social consequences. Bullying affects between 18% and 31% of adolescents and has been associated with serious negative consequences including depression, substance use, and academic failure for both the perpetrator and target. Over the past decade, bullying behavior has expanded into the digital realm and is known as cyberbullying. Cyberbullying stories have had frequent coverage by news organizations, including coverage of teens whose death from suicide was attributed to cyberbullying. Previous work illustrates the influence of news stories on individual’s attitudes and experiences. News organization coverage has been influential to readers in areas such as suicide, infectious disease outbreaks such as H1N1 flu, and tobacco use. Little is known whether and how adolescents and their families perceive or utilize news coverage of bullying or cyberbullying. News media may be an untapped resource to promote bullying prevention messages and strategies. Our long- term goal is to develop and test interventions to improve bullying prevention and intervention efforts working with media. Towards that goal, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news organization coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families. First, we will evaluate youth and parent perspectives on lay media coverage of bullying using qualitative interviews with 50 participants: 25 diverse adolescents age 15-18 years and 25 parent/guardians of these adolescents. Second, we will assess the current state of the narrative in news media coverage of bullying. We will identify a sample of 500 news articles from print/online media that cover bullying over the past 5 years and conduct content analysis using natural language processing. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software we will evaluate the proportion of words that represent fear-based reporting such as alarmist words (e.g. epidemic, tragic), as well as words that represent public health-oriented messages such as prevention. We will also compare news coverage of bullying to cyberbullying. After analyzing data from these two aims, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 journalists. Our third aim is to synthesize these findings and identify strategies for future interventions that are feasible and acceptable to journalists. We will work with 3 consultants from the fields of communication and journalism to identify and engage journalists (n=30) in qualitative interviews. When these interconnected study aims are successfully completed, outcomes will include a comprehensive understanding of how adolescents and their parents understand and utilize news coverage of bullying, the current state of bullying and cyberbullying news coverage narrative, and perspectives of journalists on intervention approaches that are feasible and acceptable. We will utilize these findings towards novel intervention approaches, such as to leverage news coverage towards enhancing prevention of bullying. PROJECT NARRATIVE Previous studies have shown that news media coverage of health issues can change attitudes and behaviors; for example, journalists’ approach to suicide can have significant impact on bereaved families and at-risk youth. News media can also complement public health efforts, such as through coverage of tobacco harms that have been shown to prevent smoking among adolescents. Bullying is a significant public health issues that can lead to short and long-term health effects and is frequently covered by news media; thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families towards developing future interventions.",Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions,9390299,R21HD090221,"['Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemic', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Priorities', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Influentials', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Journalism', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoking', 'Suicide', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'bullying', 'bullying prevention', 'contagion', 'cyberbullying', 'digital', 'experience', 'flu', 'health organization', 'improved', 'news', 'novel', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'sexual minority', 'social', 'social stigma', 'success', 'suicidal morbidity']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2017,231830,-0.10665596612901801
"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,9278303,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'novel therapeutics', 'population health', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2017,176472,0.015597477877591047
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9396635,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2017,56334,0.03410662152778567
"Monitoring and Stabilizing Behavioral Rhythms to Improve Mental Health Abstract: HealthRhythms, Inc. Substantial evidence supports the idea that disruptions in the regularity of behavioral routines (or ‘social rhythms’) can lead to the onset of psychiatric symptoms and full blown episodes via their impact on endogenous circadian rhythms and, conversely that stable social routines protect against new mood episodes. Based on our conviction that monitoring, evaluating, and increasing the regularity of behavioral rhythms has broad applicability for improving mental health, we established HealthRhythms, Inc. (www.healthrhythms.com) with the goal of using mobile technology to add the layer of mental health care to all of healthcare. Our product model capitalizes on the ubiquity and intimacy of smartphones and their capacity to sense parameters of behavior that represent key indicators of mental health on a 24/7 basis captured in the user’s natural environment, opposed to the sporadic, in-clinic measurement that has characterized mental healthcare to date. The product we envision will ultimately have three pillars: Rhythm Sensing, Rhythm Trending, and Rhythm Stabilization. The first two of these pillars have been developed and thousands of licenses for our product have already been sold. Building on our accomplishments to date, this SBIR Phase II Direct proposal extends our work in three ways: 1) further validating our existing technology, 2) developing the next stage of our technology and 3) expanding and improving our prediction models and demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of our technology. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Enhance our Rhythm Trending capabilities through intensive examination and analysis of data from the 3,000+ patients with whom our product has already been deployed. Aim 2: Develop the envisioned Rhythm Stabilization pillar of our technology. Aim 3: Expand the nature of the data included in our prediction models and demonstrate their utility.  Project Narrative HealthRhythms, Inc. is on a mission to become the world leader in tracking clinically meaningful behavioral health rhythms in order to provide automated intervention advice to patients around the globe. The work we propose in this Direct Level II SBIR application, will enable HealthRhythms to be certain that 1) we are using all the power of the smartphone to get the measurement of behavioral health exactly right and 2) we can use those measurements to help individuals with depression or anxiety make changes in their behavior that are right for them and, thereby, reduce their symptoms and keep those symptoms from coming back.",Monitoring and Stabilizing Behavioral Rhythms to Improve Mental Health,9346502,R44MH113520,"['Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Psyche structure', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stream', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral health', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'convict', 'cost effectiveness', 'experience', 'improved', 'intimate behavior', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychiatric symptom', 'sensor', 'social', 'social media', 'trend']",NIMH,"HEALTH RHYTHMS, INC.",R44,2017,964251,0.0028354122836106903
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9296185,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,572607,0.01146128353773588
"Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and difﬁculties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speciﬁc brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speciﬁc behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ﬁrst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ﬁnding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care. A primary goal of this project is to create open-source software that is used by the neuroscience community to advance research in understanding the brain basis of behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders. Project Narrative This grant is focused on developing novel analysis of complex brain networks from structural and functional imaging and using this to link brain features to behavioral phenotypes. These algorithms will be used to discover brain biomarkers of behavioral traits in Autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders.","Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes",9360120,R01EB022876,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Phenotype', 'Population Control', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain shape', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'social', 'trait']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2017,378750,-0.021377716369483414

"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9329487,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,1254231,0.005902513950639222
"The Center for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NEUROMAP) Project Summary Mood and anxiety disorders will account for approximately $16 x 109 lost productivity or 25% of global GDP over the next 20 years. Eating disorders are among the deadliest psychiatric diseases and Anorexia Nervosa is two to three times more deadly than schizophrenia, bipolar and major depressive disorder. The Center for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NeuroMAP) aims to provide a (a) scientific, (b) operational, and (c) educational infrastructure for innovative neuroscience-based research to use individual differences on several biological levels together with sophisticated statistical approaches to generate clinically meaningful predictions of risk and outcomes for mood, anxiety, and eating disorders. The Laureate Institute for Brain Research (LIBR) in Tulsa, OK, is ideally placed to provide this infrastructure because: (a) LIBR has recruited young investigators with an impressive track record of scientific productivity, (b) LIBR is situated adjacent to the Laureate Psychiatric Clinic and Hospital (LPCH), one of the Midwest's largest psychiatric facilities that provides LIBR with a pipeline for patient recruitment, and (c) LIBR closely collaborates with the University of Tulsa (TU) on computational statistics and University of Oklahoma, Tulsa (OU) on bioassay research.

"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9397322,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multitask', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'premature neonates', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,435809,-0.016313932531213455
"Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language. Under Aim 2 we will develop the technical means to integrate the ontology in a web service infrastructure. Aim 3 is to create the infrastructure to be used by those seeking and those providing trauma care assessment and to enable comparison of organizational structures of trauma care environments. In the process of comparing organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems, data will be collected from the user and stored in our data repository. Thus, while running the service, we will also be creating a data source about organization of trauma centers and trauma systems, which we will make available to those conducting comparative research on the impact of organizational structures of trauma care facilities on patient outcomes under Aim 4. The interrelation between organizational structures and patient outcome is known in the public health literature, but we lack tools to explore its effects on trauma care environments in a computer-assisted manner; our project will provide an IT framework resolving this lack. It will contribute to information and knowledge processing, advanced information retrieval, and incorporation of machine intelligence into decision processes. By providing a common schema, it will also contribute to the integration of heterogeneous data types. Our project will impact the work of organizations that assess, verify, or designate trauma care environments, as well as organizations interested in self-assessing their own organization. Supporting comparison of these organizations will not only affect assessment or certification but also add to the comparability of patient outcome data by linking it to specific organizational components. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop an IT framework accessible on the Internet that facilitates and optimizes verification of trauma centers and consultation of trauma systems and fosters comparability between trauma care environments with different organizational structures and under different legislations. Making these structures more comparable will not only benefit those who provide verification or consultation to trauma care environments, it will also allow organizations unable to acquire assessment through third parties to do in-house assessments based on data collected through best-practice assessments for the benefits of the patients. In providing these services, our framework will collect data on the organization trauma care environments, and our framework will make that data available for researchers interested in comparative studies.",Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care,9231462,R01GM111324,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Imagery', 'Information Retrieval', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organizational Models', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Assessment', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Violence', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'data access', 'data resource', 'design', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'organizational structure', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'tool', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2017,253856,0.02841737424679913
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.        ",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9108475,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2016,190952,-0.005409325619097932
"Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I aim to identify a data-driven taxonomy of depression and anxiety from multiple neurobiological measures of brain function, physiology and behavior that is not constrained by existing diagnostic boundaries. Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder are highly prevalent and together cost over $100 billion per year in care and lost productivity. While the symptoms used in the diagnosis of these disorders convey useful information and reflect real phenomenology, the way in which symptoms are grouped makes for ""fuzzy"" diagnostic boundaries, with substantial symptom overlap across disorders, yet vast symptom heterogeneity within. Moreover, experiments aiming to identify the neural contribution to dysfunction have been intrinsically tied to these traditional diagnostic categories As a consequence, we do not have a clear understanding of how the neural circuitry underlying depression and anxiety relates to the expressed symptoms at the level of physiology and behavior, independent from these traditional diagnoses. These blurry diagnostic lines hamper our progress toward understanding the mechanisms of dysfunction and developing novel, targeted therapeutics. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish a complementary characterization of anxiety and depression that reflects cohesive clusters of distinct neural causes. Addressing these issues I propose to use a data driven approach to develop an alternate classification for depression and anxiety. Under Aim 1 I will use computational methods on a rich existing dataset of over 600 participants, to derive dimensional constructs of emotion processing from neuroimaging probes of emotion reactivity and regulation and determine how these constructs are associated with other levels of function spanning behavior, physiology and self-report. Under Aim 2 I will use sparse clustering algorithms to classify individual subjects according to the neuroimaging constructs and then determine how each classification is expressed across behavioral, physiological and self-report symptom measures, independent of traditional diagnosis. To address Aim 3 I will use experimental stress probes to parse state versus trait-like components of the relationships between neuroimaging and each other unit of measurement. The outcome will be a novel classification that will advance our progress toward both understanding the mechanisms of neural dysfunction in depression and anxiety as well as developing novel therapeutics for targeting such dysfunction. Critically, the proposed multi-modal approach utilizes unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify the underlying patterns within this complex system in a manner that is free from the assumptions of the current diagnostic paradigms. The resulting characterization from this approach will provide a dimensional space to understand the natural variation in neural circuit function and how this variation relates to each person's functional phenotype. Such a characterization will be a significant step forward in transforming the way that depression and anxiety are understood, removing stigma, and allowing novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder, which are among the most frequently occurring psychiatric conditions and are associated with serious personal and societal cost, are still defined by a set of descriptive symptoms that are ignorant to the underlying neurobiology. This proposal uses advanced computational methods to identify an alternative, yet complementary, model of depression and anxiety directly linked to brain function, physiology and behavior. The resulting characterization would provide a novel, biologically based dimensional space to understand an individual's symptom profile, transform the way the way that depression and anxiety are understood and allow novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.            ",Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression,9120715,F32MH108299,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stress', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'phenomenological models', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'social stigma', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2016,50507,0.02164257294325811
"Scaling a smarter and more efficient intervention: Evaluating the feasibility of disseminating a novel mobile app platform to treat depression ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study to test the utility of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) clinical messaging tool to improve the reach and the quality (fidelity and competency) of coaches providing behavioral activation (BA) strategies through a mobile mental health app called Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivational Enhancement (PRIME). Despite decades of research and development for the treatment of mood disorders, depression has risen from the 5th leading cause of disability to the leading cause in the US. Critical barriers for progress in the field are 1) Poor access to high quality care for consumers; 2) Limited mental health workforce; and 3) Few providers are trained in the delivery of evidence-based treatments. In response to this public health problem, our team is proposing to use a mobile platform to improve access to an evidence based treatment; increase the reach of mental health coaches while supporting the delivery of higher quality of care. We will improve the reach of clinicians by using a NLP-powered messaging tool, which will ensure fidelity to the BA model and clinicians will have access to real-time clinical information about their patients to guide more targeted treatment (competence). By improving the efficiency and competence of mental health coaches in the context of mobile mental health services, we expect patients to make greater gains in depression, mood-related disability, and in achieving personal goals. In order to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, and overall impact of the enhancements to PRIME, we will spend Year 1 engaging stakeholders in a human centered iterative design process and spend Years 2-3 conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial in which we will randomize 120 individuals with depression to either receive 8- weeks of 1) PRIME 1.0 (current version) OR 2) PRIME 2.0 (version with the NLP-powered clinician dashboard). Using BRIGHTEN, our mobile clinical trial platform, we will recruit participants, consent, screen, evaluate and deliver the intervention entirely remotely. The pilot data from this study will be used to prepare for a R01 study to definitively determine whether PRIME may be used to efficiently and effectively improve outcomes for a significantly larger number of individuals with depression.

"Building Multistage Treatment Regimens for Depression after Acute Coronary SyndromeSyndrome Building Multistage Treatment Policy for Depression after Acute Coronary Syndrome Project Summary Depression is not only commonly observed among patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but also has been shown to increase risks for recurrent ACS and mortality. Despite its high prevalence and serious impact, management of post-ACS depression remains poor because of ineciencies in depression screen- ing, limited treatment options of depression after ACS, and lack of e ective procedure if initial treatment fails. To address these issues, clinical researchers have tried to develop personalized stepped care procedures for post-ACS depression patients; this involves o ering patients the choice of receiving psychotherapy and/or antidepressant treatment and adjusting treatment as needed. The treatment decisions are usually based on patient demographics, treatment preference, medical history, progress of disease, and comorbid conditions. With the development of modern technologies, the number of available treatments increases, and more pa- tient information are collected in clinical research. Thus excavating useful information for treatment decisions is becoming more challenging. In this project, we propose to develop a principled way to construct simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional data, that can be used to guide treatment selection throughout the course of the disease. Aim 1 of the project is devoted to the development of vari- able selection methodology for constructing multistage treatment policies using statistical machine learning techniques. The proposed research seeks to incorporate the popular variable selection technique (LASSO) into existing treatment policy search approaches, namely Q-learning and A-Learning, for developing optimal treatment policies and for identifying patient response status to initial treatment { an important factor for tailoring treatment in the subsequent stages. Aim 2 evaluates the proposed methods, applies the methods to post-ACS depression data, and addresses some computational challenges. Statistical research in this area has been focused on the development of evidence-based treatment policies using pre-chosen models and variables; few if any discuss how to select models or variables in a principled way. The proposed work aims to ll this gap in methodology using modern machine learning techniques. Project Narratives The proposed research aims to answer the following question:\How to excavate simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional, longitudinal medical data in a principled way?"" This is a crucial step in the management of chronic disease, such as depression, for which a large number of variables are collected over time, by facilitating the construction of a parsimonious clinical decision system.",Building Multistage Treatment Regimens for Depression after Acute Coronary SyndromeSyndrome,9180305,R21MH108999,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Weight', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'individualized medicine', 'mortality', 'preference', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'simulation', 'treatment response']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,200000,0.014915410542379614
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts.

"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9260326,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'meetings', 'memory process', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2016,773219,0.02114315413261179
"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.        ",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9102441,R01MH059929,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Exposure to', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'information processing', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'pre-clinical', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'symptomatology', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,740993,0.02889154179422641
"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This large-scale study will advance the field by studying these different outcomes at their most basic functional level, and by identifying the biological mechanisms through which these specific types of distress and dysfunction develop.",Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes,9174752,U01MH110925,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Department evaluation', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychophysics', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'biobehavior', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'minor depressive disorder', 'molecular marker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'response', 'success', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2016,3940345,-0.004199366424385127
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9096246,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2016,399327,0.03256831651381644
"Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People facing serious health threats increasingly use the Internet to obtain information and support. Internet support groups (ISGs), online communities where people come together to exchange information and/or support, are an important resource for patients grappling with serious medical conditions. Participation in health-related ISGs has been associated with significant reductions in participant-reported depression, anxiety and other indicators of psychological distress. These groups offer great potential for interventions that are highly scalable and yet easily tailored to individual needs. Unfortunately many ISG members leave too soon to benefit. In addition, there is limited scientific understanding of the active ingredients underlying the benefits that ISGs confer among their members. The proposed research uses state-of-the art machine learning and automated language analysis techniques to assess the types of interactions in online health support groups that lead to improved psychosocial well-being and health-related quality of life and how these interactions develop. It also uses these technologies and insight from our empirical research to build, deploy, and evaluate interventions that improve the interactions in health-related Internet support groups. Our work has three major aims. In Aims 1 and 2, we will analyze data from two complementary Internet support groups to identify (a) the communication processes that sustain participant engagement in the group and (b) the communication processes through which peer-to-peer interactions improve participants' psychosocial outcomes. These datasets come from an ongoing naturalistic study of 4,400 cancer survivors and caregivers in ISGs hosted by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and from a soon-to-be-completed NIMH-funded randomized trial (MH093501) assessing the effectiveness of an ISG for depressed and anxious patients referred to the group by their primary care physicians. Both datasets include participant-level data on depression, anxiety, stress and other psychosocial outcomes and detailed server logs containing information on page views, time on site, and the content of communications between participants. In Aim 3, we will develop and pilot test interventions to encourage the communication processes identified as effective in Aims 1 and 2. We will test whether mood, satisfaction with interactions and engagement in the group increase following interventions that (a) increase participants' receipt of individualized support from others; (b) provide participants with opportunities to offer support to others; (c) facilitate participants' expression of emotions; and (d) help participants form relationships with similar peers. In a series of randomized experiments, we will examine how these interventions affect participants' communication behaviors as well as short-term engagement and satisfaction with their online interactions. Results from this project will facilitate the development of an R01 application for a randomized clinical trial testing the impact of personalized ISG interventions on the length of time participants continue to participate in ISGs and participants' depression, anxiety and other psychosocial outcomes as well as healthcare utilization. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will examine how social exchanges among members of online health support groups lead to improvements in participants' health-related quality of life. Our findings will clarify the mechanisms through which social support leads to improved health-related quality of life and the process by which support resources are produced. The automated techniques we use to measure the exchange of support resources will also be the basis for interventions designed to make these exchanges more efficient and effective by matching people seeking support with those who can offer the type of support they need.",Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health,9039666,R21MH106880,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empirical Research', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Support Groups', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'communication behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'language processing', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'online community', 'peer', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'success', 'therapy design']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,192605,-0.012072513774406397
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on the effects of adolescent marijuana use on working memory, inhibitory control and corticostriatal systems.",ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project,9150541,U01DA041028,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent marijuana use', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'behavioral health', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'nonhuman primate', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'response', 'social', 'time use', 'trend']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2016,138634,0.034653767419793084
"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",9123674,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'CNR2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'data to knowledge', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'traumatic event', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2016,165886,0.016258329919510855
"Automated assessment using facial coding Abstract  Transition-age youth (TAY) from ages 18-26 are especially vulnerable to substance use, misuse, and substance use disorder (SUD). This developmental period, termed the “age of instability"" and ""emerging adulthood"" includes tasks such as leaving home, entering college; identifying vocational goals; working for the first time; body and sexuality changes; coalescing with a peer group; and for some, aging out of foster care or state custody, which end at age 18. The emerging- adulthood period is prime for experimentation with substances and the development of SUD, and associated problems such as binge drinking, driving under the influence, accidents, fighting and violence, HIV, gang involvement, suicide and self-harm, and vulnerability to date-rape and other sexual assault. A major challenge for TAY is the capacity to regulate their emotions, given the hormone changes and emotional intensity of this stage of life. Indeed, substance use is often described as a short-term way to regulate emotion and there is a long-standing literature documenting the association between emotion regulation (ER) problems and SUD. The importance of ER is also grounded in the developmental literature in which ER is identified as a core skill that is critical to the successful transition to adulthood. The initial component of ER, accurate identification of emotion, is itself a major challenge, especially for people with SUD as they are often not aware of their feelings or confused about them due to the nature of the disorder as well as mental health disorders that often co-occur with SUD.  In this phase 1 proposal we describe the development of a mobile app that uses exciting new technology (automated facial coding) to help TAY better recognize their emotions in relation to SUD variables. We describe the use of front-end focus groups to provide pre-development input on the app; we detail the app features and user experience; and define the app’s technical specifications. Phase 1 also includes a pilot feasibility study of the prototype product among TAY with SUD. They will have four weeks to use the app in their natural environment, such as home, and we will conduct pre- and post-evaluation using validated instruments to characterize the sample, quantity satisfaction and feasibility, evaluate emotion- and substance-related variables, as well as explore the app metrics and its technical performance. If positive results are found this would set us up well for phase 2, which could expand the app in some really interesting directions as well as further study it in a randomized controlled trial. The app product we envision would have major public health and clinical impact. It could help improve TAY’s ability to become more aware of their emotions and understand them in relation to SUD via an exciting emotion-focused technology innovation. If the product is successful it could also be expanded to other populations. Our stellar team includes experts in SUD, TAY, clinical innovations, technology, and app development. Narrative We propose to help young adults (ages 18-26) who have substance abuse problems. Our goal is to help them learn more about their emotions in relation to their substance abuse as a way to ultimately help them reduce their substance use. We plan to use a sophisticated technology related to emotion recognition, and to use that to help support the young adults in learning more about managing their emotions. Our work will include the development of a mobile app related to these goals.",Automated assessment using facial coding,9199791,R43DA042640,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anger', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Forcible intercourse', 'Goals', 'Guns', 'HIV', 'Home environment', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Nature', 'Overdose', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Peer Group', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sales', 'Sampling', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sexuality', 'Smiling', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'cloud based', 'college', 'craving', 'driving under influence', 'emerging adulthood', 'emotion regulation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fighting', 'foster care', 'gang', 'improved', 'information display', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'killings', 'lens', 'literacy', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'prototype', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'visual stimulus', 'young adult']",NIDA,"TREATMENT INNOVATIONS, LLC",R43,2016,225000,-0.01619247033596074
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on negative reinforcement mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high SUD prevalence, and illicit drug and prescription medication misuse among adolescents.",ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project,9150522,U01DA041089,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brain health', 'brain research', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'design', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'modifiable risk', 'named group', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychological outcomes', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stimulus processing', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'trend']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2016,1233639,0.039899171425982864
"A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade has seen explosive growth of online social networks (OSNs), which are now a pervasive part of everyday life for many people. ""Big data"" analyses of OSNs have enormous potential to enable new discoveries and applications in public health. For example we may soon be able to study how mental health indicators vary over time and between communities and regions; how major events like disasters and mass shootings affect community mental health; and potentially even use social media for individual-level screening and diagnosis. But in order to do this effectively, psychologists need to know how to make sense of vast amounts of digital records of raw behavior. That will require interdisciplinary collaborations between psychology and computer science to create new tools and methods for automated analyses of mental health variables in large and complex datasets. The goal of this project is to develop new metrics for doing large-scale, ""big data"" mental health research on Twitter, a popular online social network service with a large and diverse user base in the United States that makes most user-generated content publicly available. We are particularly interested in how Twitter data can be used to draw inferences about users' personality traits (which are indicative of risk and vulnerability), emotions, and clinical symptoms. To date, researchers studying mental health on Twitter have focused on a small number of metrics which often differ from study to study and are not always well-validated. We do not yet have a unified, comprehensive understanding of how mental health characteristics can be measured and studied online. Our project has three goals. First, we will gather data from a very large, representative sample of American Twitter users to map out what meaningful metrics can be derived from Twitter data. What can be reliably measured, and how are different kinds of metrics related to each other? By studying relationships and overlaps among these variables, we expect to identify a key set of online metrics that can be used to characterize important psychological differences among users. Second, we will recruit a sample of Twitter users to complete standardized assessments of personality, emotion, and clinical symptoms. We will look to see what kinds of online behaviors are reliable and valid markers of these psychological variables. Third, to demonstrate the utility of these markers we will monitor millions of Twitter accounts around the country for one year to measure how one specific kind of community trauma, mass shootings, affects indicators of personality, emotion, and mental health. We expect to find effects of such events on the online expression of emotion and clinical symptoms immediately following an event, and perhaps longer-term effects that endure beyond the immediate aftermath. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to identify important markers of personality, emotion, and mental health in Twitter data. This will be useful to researchers who want to use ""big data"" approaches to study mental health, and to policy applications to study individual or regional variations and reactions to events.","A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter",9132357,R21MH106879,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disasters', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Negative Valence', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Personality Traits', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structural Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'digital', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'member', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'study characteristics', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2016,172209,-0.009970911750058084
"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,9069515,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'novel therapeutics', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2016,176472,0.015597477877591047
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9109682,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,454953,0.01146128353773588
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and difﬁculties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speciﬁc brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speciﬁc behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ﬁrst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ﬁnding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care. A primary goal of this project is to create open-source software that is used by the neuroscience community to advance research in understanding the brain basis of behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders. Project Narrative This grant is focused on developing novel analysis of complex brain networks from structural and functional imaging and using this to link brain features to behavioral phenotypes.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal.

"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.            ",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9027247,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Figs - dietary', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Staging', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward processing', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,1364412,0.005902513950639222
"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,9049546,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Theory of Change', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'concept mapping', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'data access', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health service use', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'medication compliance', 'mobile computing', 'monitoring device', 'mood symptom', 'new technology', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'reduce symptoms', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,564995,0.03407745556035017
"Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language. Under Aim 2 we will develop the technical means to integrate the ontology in a web service infrastructure. Aim 3 is to create the infrastructure to be used by those seeking and those providing trauma care assessment and to enable comparison of organizational structures of trauma care environments. In the process of comparing organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems, data will be collected from the user and stored in our data repository. Thus, while running the service, we will also be creating a data source about organization of trauma centers and trauma systems, which we will make available to those conducting comparative research on the impact of organizational structures of trauma care facilities on patient outcomes under Aim 4. The interrelation between organizational structures and patient outcome is known in the public health literature, but we lack tools to explore its effects on trauma care environments in a computer-assisted manner; our project will provide an IT framework resolving this lack. It will contribute to information and knowledge processing, advanced information retrieval, and incorporation of machine intelligence into decision processes. By providing a common schema, it will also contribute to the integration of heterogeneous data types. Our project will impact the work of organizations that assess, verify, or designate trauma care environments, as well as organizations interested in self-assessing their own organization. Supporting comparison of these organizations will not only affect assessment or certification but also add to the comparability of patient outcome data by linking it to specific organizational components. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop an IT framework accessible on the Internet that facilitates and optimizes verification of trauma centers and consultation of trauma systems and fosters comparability between trauma care environments with different organizational structures and under different legislations. Making these structures more comparable will not only benefit those who provide verification or consultation to trauma care environments, it will also allow organizations unable to acquire assessment through third parties to do in-house assessments based on data collected through best-practice assessments for the benefits of the patients. In providing these services, our framework will collect data on the organization trauma care environments, and our framework will make that data available for researchers interested in comparative studies.",Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care,9026622,R01GM111324,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Housing', 'Imagery', 'Impact evaluation', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Assessment', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Violent injury', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'data access', 'design', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'organizational structure', 'prevent', 'public health research', 'tool', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2016,257217,0.02841737424679913
"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course No abstract available PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications.

"Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets. We anticipate that this approach will provide a key pillar to the development of a brain-based understanding of the heterogeneity of psychiatric disease.

"Administrative Supplement to 1R03MH105765: Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets. We anticipate that this approach will provide a key pillar to the development of a brain-based understanding of the heterogeneity of psychiatric disease.

"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.            ",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9032882,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reading', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Self-Administered', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'salivary assay', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2015,166893,-0.0026218533377277012
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders.

"Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People facing serious health threats increasingly use the Internet to obtain information and support. Internet support groups (ISGs), online communities where people come together to exchange information and/or support, are an important resource for patients grappling with serious medical conditions. Participation in health-related ISGs has been associated with significant reductions in participant-reported depression, anxiety and other indicators of psychological distress. These groups offer great potential for interventions that are highly scalable and yet easily tailored to individual needs. Unfortunately many ISG members leave too soon to benefit. In addition, there is limited scientific understanding of the active ingredients underlying the benefits that ISGs confer among their members. The proposed research uses state-of-the art machine learning and automated language analysis techniques to assess the types of interactions in online health support groups that lead to improved psychosocial well-being and health-related quality of life and how these interactions develop. It also uses these technologies and insight from our empirical research to build, deploy, and evaluate interventions that improve the interactions in health-related Internet support groups. Our work has three major aims. In Aims 1 and 2, we will analyze data from two complementary Internet support groups to identify (a) the communication processes that sustain participant engagement in the group and (b) the communication processes through which peer-to-peer interactions improve participants' psychosocial outcomes. These datasets come from an ongoing naturalistic study of 4,400 cancer survivors and caregivers in ISGs hosted by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and from a soon-to-be-completed NIMH-funded randomized trial (MH093501) assessing the effectiveness of an ISG for depressed and anxious patients referred to the group by their primary care physicians. Both datasets include participant-level data on depression, anxiety, stress and other psychosocial outcomes and detailed server logs containing information on page views, time on site, and the content of communications between participants. In Aim 3, we will develop and pilot test interventions to encourage the communication processes identified as effective in Aims 1 and 2. We will test whether mood, satisfaction with interactions and engagement in the group increase following interventions that (a) increase participants' receipt of individualized support from others; (b) provide participants with opportunities to offer support to others; (c) facilitate participants' expression of emotions; and (d) help participants form relationships with similar peers. In a series of randomized experiments, we will examine how these interventions affect participants' communication behaviors as well as short-term engagement and satisfaction with their online interactions. Results from this project will facilitate the development of an R01 application for a randomized clinical trial testing the impact of personalized ISG interventions on the length of time participants continue to participate in ISGs and participants' depression, anxiety and other psychosocial outcomes as well as healthcare utilization.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will examine how social exchanges among members of online health support groups lead to improvements in participants' health-related quality of life. Our findings will clarify the mechanisms through which social support leads to improved health-related quality of life and the process by which support resources are produced. The automated techniques we use to measure the exchange of support resources will also be the basis for interventions designed to make these exchanges more efficient and effective by matching people seeking support with those who can offer the type of support they need.            ",Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health,8873740,R21MH106880,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empirical Research', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Support Groups', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'communication behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'language processing', 'member', 'peer', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'success', 'therapy design']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,231129,-0.012072513774406397
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.            ",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,8960792,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2015,437426,0.03256831651381644
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on the effects of adolescent marijuana use on working memory, inhibitory control and corticostriatal systems.        ",ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project,9052904,U01DA041028,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent marijuana use', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'behavioral health', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'nonhuman primate', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'time use', 'trend']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2015,128696,0.034653767419793084
"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",8922958,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'CNR2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'traumatic event', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2015,166237,0.016258329919510855
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on negative reinforcement mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high SUD prevalence, and illicit drug and prescription medication misuse among adolescents.        ",ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project,9054303,U01DA041089,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brain research', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'modifiable risk', 'named group', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stimulus processing', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'trend']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2015,249952,0.039899171425982864
"A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade has seen explosive growth of online social networks (OSNs), which are now a pervasive part of everyday life for many people. ""Big data"" analyses of OSNs have enormous potential to enable new discoveries and applications in public health. For example we may soon be able to study how mental health indicators vary over time and between communities and regions; how major events like disasters and mass shootings affect community mental health; and potentially even use social media for individual-level screening and diagnosis. But in order to do this effectively, psychologists need to know how to make sense of vast amounts of digital records of raw behavior. That will require interdisciplinary collaborations between psychology and computer science to create new tools and methods for automated analyses of mental health variables in large and complex datasets. The goal of this project is to develop new metrics for doing large-scale, ""big data"" mental health research on Twitter, a popular online social network service with a large and diverse user base in the United States that makes most user-generated content publicly available. We are particularly interested in how Twitter data can be used to draw inferences about users' personality traits (which are indicative of risk and vulnerability), emotions, and clinical symptoms. To date, researchers studying mental health on Twitter have focused on a small number of metrics which often differ from study to study and are not always well-validated. We do not yet have a unified, comprehensive understanding of how mental health characteristics can be measured and studied online. Our project has three goals. First, we will gather data from a very large, representative sample of American Twitter users to map out what meaningful metrics can be derived from Twitter data. What can be reliably measured, and how are different kinds of metrics related to each other? By studying relationships and overlaps among these variables, we expect to identify a key set of online metrics that can be used to characterize important psychological differences among users. Second, we will recruit a sample of Twitter users to complete standardized assessments of personality, emotion, and clinical symptoms. We will look to see what kinds of online behaviors are reliable and valid markers of these psychological variables. Third, to demonstrate the utility of these markers we will monitor millions of Twitter accounts around the country for one year to measure how one specific kind of community trauma, mass shootings, affects indicators of personality, emotion, and mental health. We expect to find effects of such events on the online expression of emotion and clinical symptoms immediately following an event, and perhaps longer-term effects that endure beyond the immediate aftermath.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to identify important markers of personality, emotion, and mental health in Twitter data. This will be useful to researchers who want to use ""big data"" approaches to study mental health, and to policy applications to study individual or regional variations and reactions to events.            ","A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter",8873743,R21MH106879,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disasters', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Negative Valence', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Personality Traits', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structural Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'digital', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'member', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'web-based social networking']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2015,203059,-0.009970911750058084
"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,8857265,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2015,176472,0.015597477877591047
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.                ",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,8956794,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,382086,0.01146128353773588
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging studies of depression have suggested aberrant brain network relationships in this disorder. Despite these compelling findings there have been very few investigations examining the developmental timing of these alterations in children experiencing the earliest known form of depression, Preschool Depression (PD). The purpose of this mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the applicant with the skills and experience necessary to begin filling this knowledge gap. The unique mentorship and training opportunities available to the applicant complement his strong background in clinical psychology and research with clinical populations. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop an independent programmatic line of research investigating the developmental neurobiology of depression. To facilitate this goal, instruction and mentoring are proposed in 1) applying a systematic approach to the study of functional brain network development in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 2) methods for studying the relationships between brain networks and behavior in PD and 3) methods for studying the convergence between network organization and task based fMRI activity in PD. An expert interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants will support the proposed research and training plan. The feasibility of the proposed award is enhanced by the availability of a large set of fMRI data from an ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging study of school age children with a history of PD and their same age healthy peers (NIMH MH090786) as well as a high level of success in obtaining pilot fMRI data from healthy and depressed preschoolers (4-6 years old). Using these samples, a systematic approach investigating functional brain networks at the level of individual brain regions or region pairs, targeted subnetworks, and whole brain networks (using graph theory methods) is planned for aim 1. As a second aim, the behavioral correlates associated with group differences identified in aim 1 will be examined. Patterns of overlap between group differences in brain network organization and fMRI task-based activity during an emotion face-viewing paradigm (collected in the same individuals) will be the focus of a planned exploratory aim. It is hypothesized that 1) PD will be associated with disrupted Default Mode Network connectivity 2) atypical network organization will be related to depression severity and emotion regulation difficulties in PD and 3) a high level of overlap between network and task based group differences will be present. The study of brain networks in PD may reveal unique and early occurring neurobiological markers of risk for continued mood difficulties and/or later depression; information potentially critical for developing novel preventative treatments aimed at minimizing depression's public health burden. The complimentary training and research plans proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition into an independent researc career addressing NIMH research priorities that emphasize discoveries in the brain and behavioral sciences (Strategic Plan) and the study of brain networks in psychopathology (RDoC). The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder. Despite growing recognition of depression as a 'network illness', there have been very few studies examining functional brain network organization in children with very early occurring depression. Such studies could lead to the earlier identification of children who will later develop MDD and inform new preventive treatment efforts aimed at minimizing the significant burden of this important public health issue. Thus, the proposed award addresses important federal research priorities aimed at reducing the impact of depression on public health.",FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION,8880280,K23MH098176,"['6 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Crying', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethical Issues', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nursery Schools', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'School-Age Population', 'Seeds', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'case control', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'developmental neurobiology', 'early childhood', 'early experience', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional behavior', 'experience', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'peer', 'programs', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,131037,0.015217581180788446
"Biosignatures of Treatment Remission in Major Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with structural, functional, and neurochemical alterations in key interrelated brain circuits involved in emotion, reward, and executive functioning. Current models of its etiology, including genetic   expression, gene environment interactions, the monoamine hypothesis, and neurogenesis guided our choice of biomarkers. We propose to use biomarkers from several levels of organization that address one or more of these models and examine their ability to predict treatment remission. At the genetic level, we will examine epigenetic measures and the transcriptome. At the molecular level, the utility of measures of 5HT1a neuroreceptor binding using Position Emission Tomography and proteomics will be investigated. At the anatomical level, we will examine white matter tract integrity and regional decreases in cortical thickness. Functional assessments include electroencephalography, loudness   dependent auditory evoked potentials, and neurocognitive performance. Clinical features will be studied as well, e.g. presence of anxious depression, family history of depression, and others. While receiving   supportive clinical management, 300 patients will be observed medication free for 3 weeks, to diminish the influence of placebo response and minimize effects on biosignature assays. Those still meeting criteria after the 3 weeks will receive all aforementioned assessments. Patients then will be randomized in a doublemasked fashion to bupropion or escitalopram, two of the most commonly prescribed treatments for depression, with putatively distinct mechanisms of action. Treatment will be for 12-14 weeks. Treatment outcome will be remission, measures of symptomatic improvement, and assessment of adverse events. Non-remitters will be crossed over. Outcomes will be measured with both traditional and contemporary clinical assessments. Patients will be followed for 6 months after randomization to assess maintenance of response and remission. We will also use a comprehensive analysis algorithm, using novel statistical techniques for high dimensional data to develop an optimal predictive model of treatment outcome that includes all data recorded from all modalities. The statistical team will develop new strategies to address the complex data set to be generated by this study. The resulting optimized algorithm for predicting remission can serve as the basis for a new study intended to validate this tool for personalized treatment of depression. Data and biological materials collected in this project would become part of a repository, open to qualified individuals for additional analysis.

"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings.

"Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language. Under Aim 2 we will develop the technical means to integrate the ontology in a web service infrastructure. Aim 3 is to create the infrastructure to be used by those seeking and those providing trauma care assessment and to enable comparison of organizational structures of trauma care environments. In the process of comparing organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems, data will be collected from the user and stored in our data repository. Thus, while running the service, we will also be creating a data source about organization of trauma centers and trauma systems, which we will make available to those conducting comparative research on the impact of organizational structures of trauma care facilities on patient outcomes under Aim 4. The interrelation between organizational structures and patient outcome is known in the public health literature, but we lack tools to explore its effects on trauma care environments in a computer-assisted manner; our project will provide an IT framework resolving this lack. It will contribute to information and knowledge processing, advanced information retrieval, and incorporation of machine intelligence into decision processes. By providing a common schema, it will also contribute to the integration of heterogeneous data types. Our project will impact the work of organizations that assess, verify, or designate trauma care environments, as well as organizations interested in self-assessing their own organization. Supporting comparison of these organizations will not only affect assessment or certification but also add to the comparability of patient outcome data by linking it to specific organizational components.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop an IT framework accessible on the Internet that facilitates and optimizes verification of trauma centers and consultation of trauma systems and fosters comparability between trauma care environments with different organizational structures and under different legislations. Making these structures more comparable will not only benefit those who provide verification or consultation to trauma care environments, it will also allow organizations unable to acquire assessment through third parties to do in-house assessments based on data collected through best-practice assessments for the benefits of the patients. In providing these services, our framework will collect data on the organization trauma care environments, and our framework will make that data available for researchers interested in comparative studies.                ",Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care,8836850,R01GM111324,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Housing', 'Imagery', 'Impact evaluation', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Assessment', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Violent injury', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'design', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'organizational structure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'tool', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2015,270727,0.02841737424679913
"Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets. We anticipate that this approach will provide a key pillar to the development of a brain-based understanding of the heterogeneity of psychiatric disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current psychiatric nosology, embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM), is based on symptom clusters rather than underlying etiology or pathophysiology, which fundamentally limits attempts to develop novel rationally guided and biologically informed interventions. We propose to use neuroimaging measures of functional brain connectivity from multiple DSM disorders to identify fully data- driven patterns of dysconnectivity across and within existing diagnostic entities. The identified patterns will reveal abnormalities in neural network function independent of DSM diagnoses and will critically inform new brain-based diagnostic proposals, such as that envisioned by the NIMH's RDoC initiative.            ",Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning,8808026,R03MH105765,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Arbitration', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality Control', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Secondary to', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'case control', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'disease classification', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2014,74072,0.012712854030739889
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders. Identifying coherent subpopulations within the spectrum of pathological changes would further our understanding of disease etiology, and identify subconditions that require alternative or modified interventions.                ",CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION,8757373,R01MH104414,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Africa', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Elements', 'Episodic memory', 'Etiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurobiology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'base', 'cognitive system', 'computerized tools', 'disorder control', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'thalamocortical tract', 'theories', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,488401,-0.00038665370604537677
"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.

"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs.

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level  ABSTRACT: This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification. Together, these studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of brain connectivity and brain activity in autism, and set the direction for my future career.

"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,8711562,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2014,176472,0.015597477877591047
"FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging studies of depression have suggested aberrant brain network relationships in this disorder. Despite these compelling findings there have been very few investigations examining the developmental timing of these alterations in children experiencing the earliest known form of depression, Preschool Depression (PD). The purpose of this mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the applicant with the skills and experience necessary to begin filling this knowledge gap. The unique mentorship and training opportunities available to the applicant complement his strong background in clinical psychology and research with clinical populations. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop an independent programmatic line of research investigating the developmental neurobiology of depression. To facilitate this goal, instruction and mentoring are proposed in 1) applying a systematic approach to the study of functional brain network development in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 2) methods for studying the relationships between brain networks and behavior in PD and 3) methods for studying the convergence between network organization and task based fMRI activity in PD. An expert interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants will support the proposed research and training plan. The feasibility of the proposed award is enhanced by the availability of a large set of fMRI data from an ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging study of school age children with a history of PD and their same age healthy peers (NIMH MH090786) as well as a high level of success in obtaining pilot fMRI data from healthy and depressed preschoolers (4-6 years old). Using these samples, a systematic approach investigating functional brain networks at the level of individual brain regions or region pairs, targeted subnetworks, and whole brain networks (using graph theory methods) is planned for aim 1. As a second aim, the behavioral correlates associated with group differences identified in aim 1 will be examined. Patterns of overlap between group differences in brain network organization and fMRI task-based activity during an emotion face-viewing paradigm (collected in the same individuals) will be the focus of a planned exploratory aim. It is hypothesized that 1) PD will be associated with disrupted Default Mode Network connectivity 2) atypical network organization will be related to depression severity and emotion regulation difficulties in PD and 3) a high level of overlap between network and task based group differences will be present. The study of brain networks in PD may reveal unique and early occurring neurobiological markers of risk for continued mood difficulties and/or later depression; information potentially critical for developing novel preventative treatments aimed at minimizing depression's public health burden. The complimentary training and research plans proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition into an independent researc career addressing NIMH research priorities that emphasize discoveries in the brain and behavioral sciences (Strategic Plan) and the study of brain networks in psychopathology (RDoC).!          The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder. Despite growing recognition of depression as a 'network illness', there have been very few studies examining functional brain network organization in children with very early occurring depression. Such studies could lead to the earlier identification of children who will later develop MDD and inform new preventive treatment efforts aimed at minimizing the significant burden of this important public health issue. Thus, the proposed award addresses important federal research priorities aimed at reducing the impact of depression on public health.

"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.                ",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,8698820,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,506032,0.03407745556035017
"Machine learning discovery of patterns of self regulation in drug addiction and I    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is written in response to the RFA on Basic Research on Self-Regulation (RFA-AG-11-010). Disorders where poor self-regulation is a prominent feature involve great harm and pose a serious concern to public health, yet little is known about their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. A series of brain-behavior studies at our laboratory brought forth an empirically based theoretical model of human drug addiction, characterized by Impaired Response Inhibition (RI) and Salience Attribution (SA) (hence, I-RISA). The model posits that addiction involves assigning a lower importance (salience) to non-drug emotional stimuli (while over-valuing drug-related stimuli) with a concomitant compromise in inhibiting disadvantageous responses (e.g., compulsive drug-taking). Neuroimaging mapped these I-RISA components onto dysfunctional striatal- prefrontal cortical circuitry demonstrating the diathesis for impaired self-regulation in this disorder. In the current proposal we will test the I-RISA model in another externalizing psychopathology characterized by impaired self-regulation. Specifically, we will target Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), that similarly to addiction, is a chronic and relapsing disorder, featuring a skewed SA and disrupted RI (individuals with IED perceive provocation where none may have been intended, reacting with disproportionate anger that intermittently culminates in assault behavior and damage to property). In both disorders, we will target sensitive brain-behavior measures of self-regulation, using the theory-informed multidimensional datasets to develop novel computer science algorithms to conduct group classification (distinguishing between cocaine addicted individuals, IED, and healthy controls). This project represents a major departure from the current functional neuroimaging and mental health research paradigms in its focus on: (1) abstract reinforcement with money (a universal secondary reinforcer that acquires its value and uniquely impacts human emotional learning and self- control through social communication); (2) positive but also negative reinforcement (going beyond the reward principle to study compromised sensitivity to punishment and adversity); using both to predict (3) self- regulation during neuroimaging (going beyond self-report as further bolstered by psychophysiological measures); and (4) the multimodal platform to automatically perform group classification (and other machine- learning techniques, e.g., multitask) such that the common neurobehavioral signatures (but also discriminative properties) of impaired self-regulation can be identified, a prototype to be generalized to other disorders of self- regulation. The size of the potentially impacted community is of significant proportions: according to current estimates, up to 20% of the adult population in the U.S. suffers from psychiatric symptoms that impair ability to exercise self-regulation. Bringing forth significant gains toward the goal of liberating patients from the cycle of relapsing behaviors (drug use or assault behaviors) that bear catastrophic consequences to the patients themselves and with devastating costs to the broader society, this tool is estimated to be of great value.        In the current scientific endeavor we apply a well developed theoretical model to the study of the neurobiological underpinning of self-regulation in drug addicted individuals and those with Intermittent Explosive Disorder. In this functional neuroimaging research we will shift the research focus to abstract positive and negative reinforcers (emotional stimuli used to change behavior) and use sophisticated computer science algorithms to predict self-control. Thereby, integrating multimodal and cutting-edge behavioral and brain experimentation and analyses in humans, we will explore common signatures of disrupted self-regulation in two disorders of the most pressing public health concern.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.

"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.                ",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,8581368,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2013,176472,0.015597477877591047
"Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood psychiatric conditions often require that clinicians make individualized treatment decisions. In an exciting trend in child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) research and practice, there is growing interest and awareness in developing individualized decision rules (IDRs). IDRs use sociodemographic information, illness history, comorbidities, family/interpersonal measures, or biomarkers as inputs and then recommend the type, modality, and intensity or delivery of subsequent treatment(s) as outputs. IDRs provide a framework for personalized medicine: the level of personalization increases in proportion to the amount of useful information (tailoring variables) used as inputs in an IDR. The development of IDRs for the treatment of children with mental illness is an important ""next step"" in interventions research. Large scale clinical trials have established efficacious interventions fr many of the common CAMH disorders. However, despite a strong evidence base for treatments that are effective on average, little is known about which children are more or less likely to benefit from one treatment or another. Before IDRs can fulfill their potential, much methodological work remains to be done regarding how to use currently available data to assist in their development. A key step in developing effective IDRs is identifying tailoring variables to  use as inputs. Tailoring variables are special types of pre-treatment measures that pinpoint which treatment is best for whom. Existing methods do not explicitly (a) identify which measures are most useful (tailoring variable selection), or (b) combine them in an optimal fashion (tailorin variable feature construction). The specific aims of this study are: Aim 1 (Methods). To develop and evaluate a framework for (a) tailoring variable selection and (b) tailoring variable feature construction for individualizing CAMH treatment. The new method will be used to address scientific questions such as: (a) What are the most important measures (e.g., demographic, severity and duration of illness, comorbidity, parental psychopathology, psychosocial environment including family and peer relationships, biological) to use for tailoring treatment? (b) How do we combine them in order to guide treatment decisions (e.g., individual psychotherapy treatment, medication, or their combination)? Aim 2 (Application): To illustrate and evaluate the method by applying it to the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study randomized trial data to construct an IDR for choosing between SSRI, CBT, or SSRI+CBT for children with anxiety disorders. We will apply the new methodology to identify variables and features pinpointing children who are more or less likely to benefit from SSRI, CBT, or combined SSRI+CBT. Results will be used to construct a proposed IDR for pediatric anxiety disorders. We will compare how average symptom and severity outcomes differ on the IDR vs SSRI for all vs CBT for all vs SSRI+CBT for all. This study will provide researchers in CAMH with a novel tool for building IDRs. This study has significant public health impact because it aims to develop tools to personalize treatment for children and adolescents with mental health disorders. This is a high-priority area of research for the National Institute of Mental Health. This project aims to develop a new tool for deciding how to personalize (that is, individualize or  customize) treatment for children and adolescents with mental health disorders. This has important  clinical and public-health relevance because, although research has established efficacious treatments  for many child and adolescent mental health disorders, little is known about which children are more or  less likely to benefit from one treatment or another.",Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research,8494094,R03MH097954,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Seminal', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Sterile coverings', 'Symptoms', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2013,79358,-0.007174006229315711
"Neural Network Predictors of Treatment Outcome Among Adolescent Assault Victims     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for a NIMH Exploratory/Developmental Grant Award (R21) seeks to identify neural functional connectivity patterns associated with response to Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) among female adolescent assault victims. Adolescent assault exposure is a potent risk factor for persistent psychopathology, most notably PTSD. TF-CBT is the only treatment for adolescent PTSD victims with strong empirical support, yet response to TF-CBT is variable and many victims continue to exhibit clinically significant symptoms following treatment. The overall goal of this proposal is to use computational neuroscience tools to predict and understand treatment response among this vulnerable population. Based on human neuroimaging studies demonstrating altered activity and connectivity within neural networks mediating emotion reactivity and emotion regulation among PTSD victims, we hypothesize that patterns of functional connectivity within these neural networks can be used to predict and understand response to TF-CBT among adolescent assault victims. 45 adolescent assault victims aged 11-16 will be provided with a 12-week course of TF-CBT. Participants will undergo fMRI scanning while engaged in emotion reactivity and emotion regulation tasks before and after treatment. A combination of graph theory analyses and support vector classification and regression will be used to identify pre-treatment patterns of functional connectivity that predict subsequent response to TF-CBT (Aim 1). Graph theory analyses will similarly be used to identify changes in network organization from pre-to-post-treatment associated with successful (Aim 2) and unsuccessful (Aim 3) treatment response. This analytic approach to the clinical problem of understanding the variable response to TF-CBT will foster concrete algorithms to be used by a clinician to predict a child's treatment response, which is the first step towards personalizing treatments for this vulnerable population. Further, this analytic approach will identify the essential neural mechanism mediating treatment response and provide targets for the development of novel treatment components. This application proposes a novel approach towards understanding treatment response among a vulnerable adolescent population and will hopefully facilitate the development of more consistent interventions to ameliorate the high cost associated with adolescent assault exposure.          This proposal investigates neural network predictors of treatment outcome among assaulted adolescent girls. This research will lead to a better understanding of how treatment works and why some children do not respond to treatment.

"FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging studies of depression have suggested aberrant brain network relationships in this disorder. Despite these compelling findings there have been very few investigations examining the developmental timing of these alterations in children experiencing the earliest known form of depression, Preschool Depression (PD). The purpose of this mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the applicant with the skills and experience necessary to begin filling this knowledge gap. The unique mentorship and training opportunities available to the applicant complement his strong background in clinical psychology and research with clinical populations. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop an independent programmatic line of research investigating the developmental neurobiology of depression. To facilitate this goal, instruction and mentoring are proposed in 1) applying a systematic approach to the study of functional brain network development in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 2) methods for studying the relationships between brain networks and behavior in PD and 3) methods for studying the convergence between network organization and task based fMRI activity in PD. An expert interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants will support the proposed research and training plan. The feasibility of the proposed award is enhanced by the availability of a large set of fMRI data from an ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging study of school age children with a history of PD and their same age healthy peers (NIMH MH090786) as well as a high level of success in obtaining pilot fMRI data from healthy and depressed preschoolers (4-6 years old). Using these samples, a systematic approach investigating functional brain networks at the level of individual brain regions or region pairs, targeted subnetworks, and whole brain networks (using graph theory methods) is planned for aim 1. As a second aim, the behavioral correlates associated with group differences identified in aim 1 will be examined. Patterns of overlap between group differences in brain network organization and fMRI task-based activity during an emotion face-viewing paradigm (collected in the same individuals) will be the focus of a planned exploratory aim. It is hypothesized that 1) PD will be associated with disrupted Default Mode Network connectivity 2) atypical network organization will be related to depression severity and emotion regulation difficulties in PD and 3) a high level of overlap between network and task based group differences will be present. The study of brain networks in PD may reveal unique and early occurring neurobiological markers of risk for continued mood difficulties and/or later depression; information potentially critical for developing novel preventative treatments aimed at minimizing depression's public health burden. The complimentary training and research plans proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition into an independent researc career addressing NIMH research priorities that emphasize discoveries in the brain and behavioral sciences (Strategic Plan) and the study of brain networks in psychopathology (RDoC).!          The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder. Despite growing recognition of depression as a 'network illness', there have been very few studies examining functional brain network organization in children with very early occurring depression. Such studies could lead to the earlier identification of children who will later develop MDD and inform new preventive treatment efforts aimed at minimizing the significant burden of this important public health issue. Thus, the proposed award addresses important federal research priorities aimed at reducing the impact of depression on public health.

"Biosignatures of Treatment Remission in Major Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with structural, functional, and neurochemical alterations in key interrelated brain circuits involved in emotion, reward, and executive functioning. Current models of its etiology, including genetic   expression, gene environment interactions, the monoamine hypothesis, and neurogenesis guided our choice of biomarkers. We propose to use biomarkers from several levels of organization that address one or more of these models and examine their ability to predict treatment remission. At the genetic level, we will examine epigenetic measures and the transcriptome. At the molecular level, the utility of measures of 5HT1a neuroreceptor binding using Position Emission Tomography and proteomics will be investigated. At the anatomical level, we will examine white matter tract integrity and regional decreases in cortical thickness. Functional assessments include electroencephalography, loudness   dependent auditory evoked potentials, and neurocognitive performance. Clinical features will be studied as well, e.g. presence of anxious depression, family history of depression, and others. While receiving   supportive clinical management, 300 patients will be observed medication free for 3 weeks, to diminish the influence of placebo response and minimize effects on biosignature assays. Those still meeting criteria after the 3 weeks will receive all aforementioned assessments. Patients then will be randomized in a doublemasked fashion to bupropion or escitalopram, two of the most commonly prescribed treatments for depression, with putatively distinct mechanisms of action. Treatment will be for 12-14 weeks. Treatment outcome will be remission, measures of symptomatic improvement, and assessment of adverse events. Non-remitters will be crossed over. Outcomes will be measured with both traditional and contemporary clinical assessments. Patients will be followed for 6 months after randomization to assess maintenance of response and remission. We will also use a comprehensive analysis algorithm, using novel statistical techniques for high dimensional data to develop an optimal predictive model of treatment outcome that includes all data recorded from all modalities. The statistical team will develop new strategies to address the complex data set to be generated by this study. The resulting optimized algorithm for predicting remission can serve as the basis for a new study intended to validate this tool for personalized treatment of depression. Data and biological materials collected in this project would become part of a repository, open to qualified individuals for additional analysis.

"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians.

"Machine learning discovery of patterns of self regulation in drug addiction and I    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is written in response to the RFA on Basic Research on Self-Regulation (RFA-AG-11-010). Disorders where poor self-regulation is a prominent feature involve great harm and pose a serious concern to public health, yet little is known about their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. A series of brain-behavior studies at our laboratory brought forth an empirically based theoretical model of human drug addiction, characterized by Impaired Response Inhibition (RI) and Salience Attribution (SA) (hence, I-RISA). The model posits that addiction involves assigning a lower importance (salience) to non-drug emotional stimuli (while over-valuing drug-related stimuli) with a concomitant compromise in inhibiting disadvantageous responses (e.g., compulsive drug-taking). Neuroimaging mapped these I-RISA components onto dysfunctional striatal- prefrontal cortical circuitry demonstrating the diathesis for impaired self-regulation in this disorder. In the current proposal we will test the I-RISA model in another externalizing psychopathology characterized by impaired self-regulation. Specifically, we will target Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), that similarly to addiction, is a chronic and relapsing disorder, featuring a skewed SA and disrupted RI (individuals with IED perceive provocation where none may have been intended, reacting with disproportionate anger that intermittently culminates in assault behavior and damage to property). In both disorders, we will target sensitive brain-behavior measures of self-regulation, using the theory-informed multidimensional datasets to develop novel computer science algorithms to conduct group classification (distinguishing between cocaine addicted individuals, IED, and healthy controls). This project represents a major departure from the current functional neuroimaging and mental health research paradigms in its focus on: (1) abstract reinforcement with money (a universal secondary reinforcer that acquires its value and uniquely impacts human emotional learning and self- control through social communication); (2) positive but also negative reinforcement (going beyond the reward principle to study compromised sensitivity to punishment and adversity); using both to predict (3) self- regulation during neuroimaging (going beyond self-report as further bolstered by psychophysiological measures); and (4) the multimodal platform to automatically perform group classification (and other machine- learning techniques, e.g., multitask) such that the common neurobehavioral signatures (but also discriminative properties) of impaired self-regulation can be identified, a prototype to be generalized to other disorders of self- regulation. The size of the potentially impacted community is of significant proportions: according to current estimates, up to 20% of the adult population in the U.S. suffers from psychiatric symptoms that impair ability to exercise self-regulation. Bringing forth significant gains toward the goal of liberating patients from the cycle of relapsing behaviors (drug use or assault behaviors) that bear catastrophic consequences to the patients themselves and with devastating costs to the broader society, this tool is estimated to be of great value.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the current scientific endeavor we apply a well developed theoretical model to the study of the neurobiological underpinning of self-regulation in drug addicted individuals and those with Intermittent Explosive Disorder.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.

"Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Childhood psychiatric conditions often require that clinicians make individualized treatment decisions. In an exciting trend in child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) research and practice, there is growing interest and awareness in developing individualized decision rules (IDRs). IDRs use sociodemographic information, illness history, comorbidities, family/interpersonal measures, or biomarkers as inputs and then recommend the type, modality, and intensity or delivery of subsequent treatment(s) as outputs. IDRs provide a framework for personalized medicine: the level of personalization increases in proportion to the amount of useful information (tailoring variables) used as inputs in an IDR. The development of IDRs for the treatment of children with mental illness is an important ""next step"" in interventions research. Large scale clinical trials have established efficacious interventions fr many of the common CAMH disorders. However, despite a strong evidence base for treatments that are effective on average, little is known about which children are more or less likely to benefit from one treatment or another. Before IDRs can fulfill their potential, much methodological work remains to be done regarding how to use currently available data to assist in their development. A key step in developing effective IDRs is identifying tailoring variables to use as inputs. Tailoring variables are special types of pre-treatment measures that pinpoint which treatment is best for whom. Existing methods do not explicitly (a) identify which measures are most useful (tailoring variable selection), or (b) combine them in an optimal fashion (tailorin variable feature construction). The specific aims of this study are: Aim 1 (Methods). To develop and evaluate a framework for (a) tailoring variable selection and (b) tailoring variable feature construction for individualizing CAMH treatment. The new method will be used to address scientific questions such as: (a) What are the most important measures (e.g., demographic, severity and duration of illness, comorbidity, parental psychopathology, psychosocial environment including family and peer relationships, biological) to use for tailoring treatment? (b) How do we combine them in order to guide treatment decisions (e.g., individual psychotherapy treatment, medication, or their combination)? Aim 2 (Application): To illustrate and evaluate the method by applying it to the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study randomized trial data to construct an IDR for choosing between SSRI, CBT, or SSRI+CBT for children with anxiety disorders. We will apply the new methodology to identify variables and features pinpointing children who are more or less likely to benefit from SSRI, CBT, or combined SSRI+CBT. Results will be used to construct a proposed IDR for pediatric anxiety disorders. We will compare how average symptom and severity outcomes differ on the IDR vs SSRI for all vs CBT for all vs SSRI+CBT for all.  This study will provide researchers in CAMH with a novel tool for building IDRs. This study has significant public health impact because it aims to develop tools to personalize treatment for children and adolescents with mental health disorders.

"Neural Network Predictors of Treatment Outcome Among Adolescent Assault Victims     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for a NIMH Exploratory/Developmental Grant Award (R21) seeks to identify neural functional connectivity patterns associated with response to Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) among female adolescent assault victims. Adolescent assault exposure is a potent risk factor for persistent psychopathology, most notably PTSD. TF-CBT is the only treatment for adolescent PTSD victims with strong empirical support, yet response to TF-CBT is variable and many victims continue to exhibit clinically significant symptoms following treatment. The overall goal of this proposal is to use computational neuroscience tools to predict and understand treatment response among this vulnerable population. Based on human neuroimaging studies demonstrating altered activity and connectivity within neural networks mediating emotion reactivity and emotion regulation among PTSD victims, we hypothesize that patterns of functional connectivity within these neural networks can be used to predict and understand response to TF-CBT among adolescent assault victims. 45 adolescent assault victims aged 11-16 will be provided with a 12-week course of TF-CBT. Participants will undergo fMRI scanning while engaged in emotion reactivity and emotion regulation tasks before and after treatment. A combination of graph theory analyses and support vector classification and regression will be used to identify pre-treatment patterns of functional connectivity that predict subsequent response to TF-CBT (Aim 1). Graph theory analyses will similarly be used to identify changes in network organization from pre-to-post-treatment associated with successful (Aim 2) and unsuccessful (Aim 3) treatment response. This analytic approach to the clinical problem of understanding the variable response to TF-CBT will foster concrete algorithms to be used by a clinician to predict a child's treatment response, which is the first step towards personalizing treatments for this vulnerable population. Further, this analytic approach will identify the essential neural mechanism mediating treatment response and provide targets for the development of novel treatment components. This application proposes a novel approach towards understanding treatment response among a vulnerable adolescent population and will hopefully facilitate the development of more consistent interventions to ameliorate the high cost associated with adolescent assault exposure.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal investigates neural network predictors of treatment outcome among assaulted adolescent girls. This research will lead to a better understanding of how treatment works and why some children do not respond to treatment.              This proposal investigates neural network predictors of treatment outcome among assaulted adolescent girls.

"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving  Project Summary Abstract This proposal aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effets of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding).

"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.        The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.

"FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging studies of depression have suggested aberrant brain network relationships in this disorder. Despite these compelling findings there have been very few investigations examining the developmental timing of these alterations in children experiencing the earliest known form of depression, Preschool Depression (PD). The purpose of this mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the applicant with the skills and experience necessary to begin filling this knowledge gap. The unique mentorship and training opportunities available to the applicant complement his strong background in clinical psychology and research with clinical populations. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop an independent programmatic line of research investigating the developmental neurobiology of depression. To facilitate this goal, instruction and mentoring are proposed in 1) applying a systematic approach to the study of functional brain network development in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 2) methods for studying the relationships between brain networks and behavior in PD and 3) methods for studying the convergence between network organization and task based fMRI activity in PD. An expert interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants will support the proposed research and training plan. The feasibility of the proposed award is enhanced by the availability of a large set of fMRI data from an ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging study of school age children with a history of PD and their same age healthy peers (NIMH MH090786) as well as a high level of success in obtaining pilot fMRI data from healthy and depressed preschoolers (4-6 years old). Using these samples, a systematic approach investigating functional brain networks at the level of individual brain regions or region pairs, targeted subnetworks, and whole brain networks (using graph theory methods) is planned for aim 1. As a second aim, the behavioral correlates associated with group differences identified in aim 1 will be examined. Patterns of overlap between group differences in brain network organization and fMRI task-based activity during an emotion face-viewing paradigm (collected in the same individuals) will be the focus of a planned exploratory aim. It is hypothesized that 1) PD will be associated with disrupted Default Mode Network connectivity 2) atypical network organization will be related to depression severity and emotion regulation difficulties in PD and 3) a high level of overlap between network and task based group differences will be present. The study of brain networks in PD may reveal unique and early occurring neurobiological markers of risk for continued mood difficulties and/or later depression; information potentially critical for developing novel preventative treatments aimed at minimizing depression's public health burden. The complimentary training and research plans proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition into an independent researc career addressing NIMH research priorities that emphasize discoveries in the brain and behavioral sciences (Strategic Plan) and the study of brain networks in psychopathology (RDoC).!        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder. Despite growing recognition of depression as a 'network illness', there have been very few studies examining functional brain network organization in children with very early occurring depression. Such studies could lead to the earlier identification of children who will later develop MDD and inform new preventive treatment efforts aimed at minimizing the significant burden of this important public health issue. Thus, the proposed award addresses important federal research priorities aimed at reducing the impact of depression on public health.                  The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder.

"Biosignatures of Treatment Remission in Major Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with structural, functional, and neurochemical alterations in key interrelated brain circuits involved in emotion, reward, and executive functioning. Current models of its etiology, including genetic expression, gene environment interactions, the monoamine hypothesis, and neurogenesis guided our choice of biomarkers. We propose to use biomarkers from several levels of organization that address one or more of these models and examine their ability to predict treatment remission. At the genetic level, we will examine epigenetic measures and the transcriptome. At the molecular level, the utility of measures of 5HT1a neuroreceptor binding using Position Emission Tomography and proteomics will be investigated. At the anatomical level, we will examine white matter tract integrity and regional decreases in cortical thickness. Functional assessments include electroencephalography, loudness   dependent auditory evoked potentials, and neurocognitive performance. Clinical features will be studied as well, e.g. presence of anxious depression, family history of depression, and others. While receiving   supportive clinical management, 300 patients will be observed medication free for 3 weeks, to diminish the influence of placebo response and minimize effects on biosignature assays. Those still meeting criteria after the 3 weeks will receive all aforementioned assessments. Patients then will be randomized in a doublemasked fashion to bupropion or escitalopram, two of the most commonly prescribed treatments for depression, with putatively distinct mechanisms of action. Treatment will be for 12-14 weeks. Treatment outcome will be remission, measures of symptomatic improvement, and assessment of adverse events. Non-remitters will be crossed over. Outcomes will be measured with both traditional and contemporary clinical assessments. Patients will be followed for 6 months after randomization to assess maintenance of response and remission. We will also use a comprehensive analysis algorithm, using novel statistical techniques for high dimensional data to develop an optimal predictive model of treatment outcome that includes all data recorded from all modalities. The statistical team will develop new strategies to address the complex data set to be generated by this study. The resulting optimized algorithm for predicting remission can serve as the basis for a new study intended to validate this tool for personalized treatment of depression.

"Technology-Based Training for Evidence-Based Practice in Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One important barrier to the successful dissemination of evidence-based practices (EBP) in mental health is the need to train therapists effectively and affordably. To date, the most common training methods in mental health tend to lead to increases in knowledge about EBP but not to skill development or behavior change. The present study will integrate state-of-the art technologies, prior literature on therapist training, and learning theory to develop an accessible and engaging practice component for a traditional online EBP training, with the goal of increasing trainees' skill in a specific EBP in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, the proposed study will have two phases: first, it will first develop a high-quality traditional online training to teach clinicians-in-training how to conduct evidence-based suicide risk assessment. In addition, it will develop an interactive computerized practice client with whom trainees can interact in order to rehearse newly learned concepts and build skill. These training components will be developed in consultation with content and technology experts to ensure the best possible quality of trainings. In its second phase, the present study will test the acceptability and efficacy of the virtual client practice tool by randomly assigning approximately 300 clinicians in training to receive the training as usual, the traditional online training alone, or the traditional online training plus the virtual practice component. It is anticipated that trainees interacting with the practice client will report higher training satisfaction, will show higher training use, and will obtain higher scores on questionnaires and simulations measuring skill in risk assessment than trainees receiving the training as usual or the traditional online training only. Trainees' risk assessment knowledge will also be measured, although no group differences are expected in this domain. The proposed study is a randomized-controlled trial, with measures collected at baseline, post-training, and follow-up (60 days). Trainees who agree to participate will be given access to the study measures (satisfaction, knowledge, and skill) online. Training use will be unobtrusively measured through automated recording of training access data. Planned data analyses will use hierarchical linear regression to predict scores on each study outcome from group status, controlling for training program. Any variables failing a randomization check will also be controlled for. Hierarchical linear modeling will allow for analysis of repeated measures while accounting for the nested structure of the proposed dataset (trainees nested within courses). The proposed study addresses one of the four primary objectives of the NIH: to ""help close the gap between the development of new, research-tested interventions and their wide-spread use by those most in need"" (Strategic Objective 4). The proposed study is also consistent with the goal of this funding mechanism to improve the quality of the training environment. Finally, by developing a potentially cost-effective therapist training tool that can be easily deployed to remote areas, it has the potential to improve the quality of care to underserved populations and contribute to the NIH goal of eliminating health disparities.          Several specific forms of assessment and psychotherapy have been developed for common youth mental health problems, which are both science-based and known to work better than usual assessment and treatments. However, these evidence-based practices are not widely used in community agencies. This is partly because current methods for training therapists are either affordable but do not lead to changes in therapist behavior or client outcomes (e.g., brief workshops), or are effective in changing therapist behavior but are more time, resource, and cost-intensive than most agencies can afford (e.g., adequate ongoing supervision and consultation). The present study will employ advanced but widely available technologies to develop an engaging, affordable, standardized tool for training therapists that offers therapists the opportunity to practice skills repeatedly in a realistic and safe environment where they receive immediate feedback. By establishing the acceptability and feasibility of this tool, the current study has the potential to advance the field's knowledge of how to effectively train therapists in general, and of how to disseminate evidence-based practices to settings where they are most needed. In particular, if successful the proposed training practice tool can easily and affordably be deployed to even remote and rural areas to improve therapist training in those settings. As such, the proposed study could help improve the quality of care received by such typically underserved populations in order to help reduce health disparities. In addition, by applying this tool to a broad and important public health concern such as adolescent suicide risk assessment, the study also has the potential to directly enhance therapists' skill and confidence in conducting state-of-the-science, sensitive risk assessments using empirically grounded strategies, which could, in turn, help them save lives.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.           Project Narrative Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning.

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification. Together, these studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of brain connectivity and brain activity in autism, and set the direction for my future career.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism. This will be important information for guiding future diagnoses and intervention.              These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism.

"Building a Risk Stratification Model for Treatment Resistance in Major Depressive    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One-third or more of individuals treated for major depressive disorder (MDD) do not experience remission of symptoms despite at least two adequate antidepressant trials. Such treatment-resistant depression (TRD) contributes disproportionately to the tremendous costs of MDD, in terms of health care costs, functional impairment, and diminished quality of life. The promise of personalized medicine for individuals at high risk for TRD is apparent. If these individuals could be recognized early in their disease course, they could be triaged to more intensive or targeted interventions to improve their likelihood of remission. For example, they might receive earlier addition of cognitive-behavioral therapy, earlier use of combination medication treatments, or earlier referral for electroconvulsive therapy. With the proliferation of treatment options in MDD, individuals can spend months or years in and out of treatment before receiving these next-step treatments. Moreover, the ability to identify these individuals would facilitate the development of new personalized interventions: rather than the requiring multiple failed prospective trials, high-risk individuals could immediately be offered study participation. At present, there are two primary obstacles to translating personalized medicine into clinical practice. First, no large and generalizable cohorts have been collected in which to build risk models. Second, no validation cohorts exist to demonstrate that such models perform well in clinical settings. The present study proposes to address these two obstacles directly. Previous investigations, including work in the large multicenter Systematic Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, have identified putative clinical or genetic predictors of treatment response. However, in the absence of replication, such associations are hypothesis-generating at best. An ongoing study will collect data from 1,000 individuals treated in a New England health system for whom prospective treatment outcomes are available (the Dep1 cohort), including 500 individuals with TRD and 500 with SSRI-responsive MDD, with completion of a genome wide association study expected by spring 2009. The proposed study will first use cutting-edge modeling techniques to construct and cross-validate models of TRD using sociodemographic, clinical, and genetic predictors in the existing Dep1 cohort. In parallel, it will collect an additional 1,000 MDD subjects with 6-month treatment outcomes from the same health system. This second cohort (Dep2) will be used to validate the TRD risk stratification model. To identify these patient cohorts, this study will take advantage of computerized administrative data systems, data-mining, and natural language processing techniques that have been successfully applied to support population-based research. This approach allows identification of clinical features, such as comorbidities, medication treatments, as well as longitudinal outcomes, based on claims, pharmacy data, and medical records. The resulting patient data is far more representative of clinical populations, and far less expensive to generate, than that which could be obtained using more traditional approaches. Therefore, beyond facilitating personalized treatment of MDD, the proposed study would establish the methodology for using large clinical populations to personalize treatment in psychiatry as a whole.       Public Health Relevance: A third or more of people with major depression do not get well despite two or more different treatments, and identifying these people early in treatment might allow more personalized approaches with greater chances of success. This study will use statistical techniques to try to predict who is at risk for this treatment- resistant depression, based on clinical differences and genetic variations. Then, it will examine a second group of patients to see how well this technique might work if it is applied in a large health system.           Narrative A third or more of people with major depression do not get well despite two or more different treatments, and identifying these people early in treatment might allow more personalized approaches with greater chances of success.

"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effects of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding). The developmental and experimental elements of this application will lead to new avenues for treatment that would be readily generalizable to other forms of drug addiction besides nicotine, and potentially impacting on the outcomes of the substantial numbers of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of new methodology for the treatment of patients with substance use disorders would represent a significant advance in the therapeutics of these disorders. The studies proposed offer a new treatment alternative for these otherwise highly recurrent and chronic illnesses.           Project Narrative The development of new methodology for the treatment of patients with substance use disorders would represent a significant advance in the theraputics of these disorders.

"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.           The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research.

"Biosignatures of Treatment Remission in Major Depression Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with structural, functional, and neurochemical alterations in key interrelated brain circuits involved in emotion, reward, and executive functioning. Current models of its etiology, including genetic expression, gene environment interactions, the monoamine hypothesis, and neurogenesis guided our choice of biomarkers. We propose to use biomarkers from several levels of organization that address one or more of these models and examine their ability to predict treatment remission. At the genetic level, we will examine epigenetic measures and the transcriptome. At the molecular level, the utility of measures of 5HT1a neuroreceptor binding using Position Emission Tomography and proteomics will be investigated. At the anatomical level, we will examine white matter tract integrity and regional decreases in cortical thickness. Functional assessments include electroencephalography, loudness dependent auditory evoked potentials, and neurocognitive performance. Clinical features will be studied as well, e.g. presence of anxious depression, family history of depression, and others. While receiving supportive clinical management, 300 patients will be observed medication free for 3 weeks, to diminish the influence of placebo response and minimize effects on biosignature assays. Those still meeting criteria after the 3 weeks will receive all aforementioned assessments. Patients then will be randomized in a doublemasked fashion to bupropion or escitalopram, two of the most commonly prescribed treatments for depression, with putatively distinct mechanisms of action. Treatment will be for 12-14 weeks. Treatment outcome will be remission, measures of symptomatic improvement, and assessment of adverse events. Non-remitters will be crossed over. Outcomes will be measured with both traditional and contemporary clinical assessments. Patients will be followed for 6 months after randomization to assess maintenance of response and remission. We will also use a comprehensive analysis algorithm, using novel statistical techniques for high dimensional data to develop an optimal predictive model of treatment outcome that includes all data recorded from all modalities. The statistical team will develop new strategies to address the complex data set to be generated by this study. The resulting optimized algorithm for predicting remission can serve as the basis for a new study intended to validate this tool for personalized treatment of depression. Data and biological materials collected in this project would become part of a repository, open to qualified individuals for additional analysis.

The present study will integrate state-of-the art technologies, prior literature on therapist training, and learning theory to develop an accessible and engaging practice component for a traditional online EBP training, with the goal of increasing trainees' skill in a specific EBP in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, the proposed study will have two phases: first, it will first develop a high-quality traditional online training to teach clinicians-in-training how to conduct evidence-based suicide risk assessment. In addition, it will develop an interactive computerized practice client with whom trainees can interact in order to rehearse newly learned concepts and build skill. These training components will be developed in consultation with content and technology experts to ensure the best possible quality of trainings. In its second phase, the present study will test the acceptability and efficacy of the virtual client practice tool by randomly assigning approximately 300 clinicians in training to receive the training as usual, the traditional online training alone, or the traditional online training plus the virtual practice component. It is anticipated that trainees interacting with the practice client will report higher training satisfaction, will show higher training use, and will obtain higher scores on questionnaires and simulations measuring skill in risk assessment than trainees receiving the training as usual or the traditional online training only. Trainees' risk assessment knowledge will also be measured, although no group differences are expected in this domain. The proposed study is a randomized-controlled trial, with measures collected at baseline, post-training, and follow-up (60 days). Trainees who agree to participate will be given access to the study measures (satisfaction, knowledge, and skill) online. Training use will be unobtrusively measured through automated recording of training access data. Planned data analyses will use hierarchical linear regression to predict scores on each study outcome from group status, controlling for training program. Any variables failing a randomization check will also be controlled for. Hierarchical linear modeling will allow for analysis of repeated measures while accounting for the nested structure of the proposed dataset (trainees nested within courses). The proposed study addresses one of the four primary objectives of the NIH: to ""help close the gap between the development of new, research-tested interventions and their wide-spread use by those most in need"" (Strategic Objective 4). The proposed study is also consistent with the goal of this funding mechanism to improve the quality of the training environment. Finally, by developing a potentially cost-effective therapist training tool that can be easily deployed to remote areas, it has the potential to improve the quality of care to underserved populations and contribute to the NIH goal of eliminating health disparities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Several specific forms of assessment and psychotherapy have been developed for common youth mental health problems, which are both science-based and known to work better than usual assessment and treatments. However, these evidence-based practices are not widely used in community agencies. This is partly because current methods for training therapists are either affordable but do not lead to changes in therapist behavior or client outcomes (e.g., brief workshops), or are effective in changing therapist behavior but are more time, resource, and cost-intensive than most agencies can afford (e.g., adequate ongoing supervision and consultation). The present study will employ advanced but widely available technologies to develop an engaging, affordable, standardized tool for training therapists that offers therapists the opportunity to practice skills repeatedly in a realistic and safe environment where they receive immediate feedback. By establishing the acceptability and feasibility of this tool, the current study has the potential to advance the field's knowledge of how to effectively train therapists in general, and of how to disseminate evidence-based practices to settings where they are most needed. In particular, if successful the proposed training practice tool can easily and affordably be deployed to even remote and rural areas to improve therapist training in those settings. As such, the proposed study could help improve the quality of care received by such typically underserved populations in order to help reduce health disparities. In addition, by applying this tool to a broad and important public health concern such as adolescent suicide risk assessment, the study also has the potential to directly enhance therapists' skill and confidence in conducting state-of-the-science, sensitive risk assessments using empirically grounded strategies, which could, in turn, help them save lives.                Several specific forms of assessment and psychotherapy have been developed for common youth mental health problems, which are both science-based and known to work better than usual assessment and treatments.

"Biological and Information Processing Mechanisms Underlying Autism This center focuses on elucidating fundamental information processing and neurobiological mechanisms causing autism. It incorporates 5 themes: 1) autism as a disorder of complex information processing abilities WITH intact or enhanced basic abilities; 2) autism as a disturbance in cerebral connectivity with under connectivity of long-distance connections and over-connectivity of compensatory local connections; 3) autism as a developmental disorder whose brain-behavioral manifestations change with each stage of brain maturation from childhood to adulthood; 4) that the pathognomonic social impairments are best understood in terms of underlying information processing mechanisms; and 5) that emotional and affective impairments are a major component of the syndrome and significant contributor to impaired function and serious behavior issues. These goals will be addressed using behavioral, cognitive, fMRI, DTI, DTT, and neuropathologic studies of: infant siblings, first-diagnosed toddlers with autism, and groups of children, adolescents, and adults with and without autism. Project I: Development of Categorization & Facial Knowledge in Low & High Functioning Autism; Project II: Disturbances of Affective Contact: Development of Brain Mechanisms for Emotion Processing; Project III: Systems Connectivity & Brain Activation: Imaging Studies of Language & Perception; Project IV: Diffusion Tensor MRI & Histopathology of Brain Microstructure & Fiber Pathways. Project I focuses on understanding the earliest manifestations of autism and the development of earlier diagnostic tools; it also focuses on information processing mechanisms underlying social and cognitive symptoms. Project II focuses on elucidating emotion processing mechanisms and the maturational disturbances from childhood through adulthood; these studies will clarify how individuals with autism experience, understand and regulate emotion, and will also examine their self-awareness of emotion. Genetic modifiers of emotionality will also be determined. Project III focuses on understanding disturbances in functional brain connectivity that underlie the impaired processing of information and in turn the cognitive and behavioral impairments in autism. The project also includes innovative machine-learning studies of how the brain identifies and categorizes words and computational modeling of cortical function. Project IV looks at structural connectivity of specific white matter pathways and the histopathology of intra-cortical white matter projections. This project will help reconcile the functional under-connectivity and early structural overgrowth in autism. The identification of fundamental information processing mechanisms underlying the behavior of autism will lead to the development of more specific and effective interventions; similarly identification of connectivity alterations can lead to targeted cognitive interventions that increase neural connectivity.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.           Project Narrative Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning.

"Building a Risk Stratification Model for Treatment Resistance in Major Depressive    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One-third or more of individuals treated for major depressive disorder (MDD) do not experience remission of symptoms despite at least two adequate antidepressant trials. Such treatment-resistant depression (TRD) contributes disproportionately to the tremendous costs of MDD, in terms of health care costs, functional impairment, and diminished quality of life. The promise of personalized medicine for individuals at high risk for TRD is apparent. If these individuals could be recognized early in their disease course, they could be triaged to more intensive or targeted interventions to improve their likelihood of remission. For example, they might receive earlier addition of cognitive-behavioral therapy, earlier use of combination medication treatments, or earlier referral for electroconvulsive therapy. With the proliferation of treatment options in MDD, individuals can spend months or years in and out of treatment before receiving these next-step treatments. Moreover, the ability to identify these individuals would facilitate the development of new personalized interventions: rather than the requiring multiple failed prospective trials, high-risk individuals could immediately be offered study participation. At present, there are two primary obstacles to translating personalized medicine into clinical practice. First, no large and generalizable cohorts have been collected in which to build risk models. Second, no validation cohorts exist to demonstrate that such models perform well in clinical settings. The present study proposes to address these two obstacles directly. Previous investigations, including work in the large multicenter Systematic Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, have identified putative clinical or genetic predictors of treatment response. However, in the absence of replication, such associations are hypothesis-generating at best. An ongoing study will collect data from 1,000 individuals treated in a New England health system for whom prospective treatment outcomes are available (the Dep1 cohort), including 500 individuals with TRD and 500 with SSRI-responsive MDD, with completion of a genome wide association study expected by spring 2009. The proposed study will first use cutting-edge modeling techniques to construct and cross-validate models of TRD using sociodemographic, clinical, and genetic predictors in the existing Dep1 cohort. In parallel, it will collect an additional 1,000 MDD subjects with 6-month treatment outcomes from the same health system. This second cohort (Dep2) will be used to validate the TRD risk stratification model. To identify these patient cohorts, this study will take advantage of computerized administrative data systems, data-mining, and natural language processing techniques that have been successfully applied to support population-based research. This approach allows identification of clinical features, such as comorbidities, medication treatments, as well as longitudinal outcomes, based on claims, pharmacy data, and medical records. The resulting patient data is far more representative of clinical populations, and far less expensive to generate, than that which could be obtained using more traditional approaches. Therefore, beyond facilitating personalized treatment of MDD, the proposed study would establish the methodology for using large clinical populations to personalize treatment in psychiatry as a whole.       Public Health Relevance: A third or more of people with major depression do not get well despite two or more different treatments, and identifying these people early in treatment might allow more personalized approaches with greater chances of success. This study will use statistical techniques to try to predict who is at risk for this treatment- resistant depression, based on clinical differences and genetic variations. Then, it will examine a second group of patients to see how well this technique might work if it is applied in a large health system.           Narrative A third or more of people with major depression do not get well despite two or more different treatments, and identifying these people early in treatment might allow more personalized approaches with greater chances of success.

"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effects of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding). The developmental and experimental elements of this application will lead to new avenues for treatment that would be readily generalizable to other forms of drug addiction besides nicotine, and potentially impacting on the outcomes of the substantial numbers of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of new methodology for the treatment of patients with substance use disorders would represent a significant advance in the therapeutics of these disorders.

"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effects of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding).

"ACTUARIAL STRATEGIES IN CHILD DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT  The proposed project involves a preliminary investigation of                                                                                   potentially significant methodological advance in diagnostic assessment. The         current state-of-the-art in diagnostic assessment involves the use of a              structured interview. Typically, structured interviews involve a static skip         structure, i.e., some portions of the interview are administered conditional on                                 particular responses to prior questions. For example, if there is a negative         response to a question about depression and anhedonia, most structured               interviews require the clinical to skip the remaining questions about                associated symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, etc.).         Although structured interviews represent an enormous advantage over earlier          diagnostic procedures, their inflexible structure is often incompatible with         the heterogeneity of most child and adolescent populations, and can result in        superfluous questioning about uncommon disorders and insufficient follow-up          about more common ones. Many interviews do not make exceptions for individual        characteristics. For example, 1) a 17 year old boy might need to answer ""no"" to      5 or 6 questions about separation anxiety before the interviewer may move on to      another set of questions; or 2) an underweight 16 year old girl might not be         asked important follow-up questions when replying ""no"" to the initial question       about eating disorders. One might conclude that introducing more clinician           flexibility would be the solution; however, the literature on clinical judgment      suggests that increasing clinician involvement in determination of interview         structure would likely degrade classification accuracy and introduce unwanted        sources of error and bias. To address this issue in another manner, the              principal investigator has developed a data-driven, actuarial expert system to       guide a flexible interview structure. Thus, interview structure is dynamically       responsive to individual characteristics, without introducing error associated       with qualitative clinical judgments. Pilot modeling revealed that his system         offers advantages in classification accuracy over state-of-the-art diagnostic        approaches, with the additional benefit of reducing administration time for          particular disorders. The current project is planned to generate requisite data      to develop a formal expert system and to forecast its relative accuracy and          efficiency in a child and adolescent population. It is predicted that this           system will demonstrate improvements in classification accuracy over a static        structured interview approach, with reduced administration time.

"Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  The rate of substance use-related hospital visits in the US continues to increase, and now outpaces visits for heart disease and respiratory failure. The prevalence of substance misuse (nonmedical use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines, illicit drugs, and/or alcohol) in hospitalized patients is estimated to be 15%-25% and far exceeds the prevalence in the general population. With over 35 million hospitalized patients per year, tens of millions of patients are not screened for substance misuse during their stay. Despite the recommendation for self-report questionnaires (single-question universal screens, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT], Drug Abuse Screening Tool [DAST]), screening rates remains low in hospitals. Current screening methods are resource-intensive, so a comprehensive and automated approach to substance misuse screening that will augment current clinical workflow would therefore be of great utility.  In the advent of Meaningful Use in the electronic health record (EHR), efficiency for substance misuse detection may be improved by leveraging data collected during usual care. Documentation of substance use is common and occurs in 97% of provider admission notes, but their free text format renders them difficult to mine and analyze. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning are subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) that provide a solution to analyze text data in the EHR to identify substance misuse. Modern NLP has fused with machine learning, another sub-field of AI focused on learning from data. In particular, the most powerful NLP methods rely on supervised learning, a type of machine learning that takes advantage of current reference standards to make predictions about unseen cases  In our earlier version of an NLP and machine learning tool, our opioid and alcohol misuse classifiers successfully used data from clinical notes collected in the first 24 hours of hospital admission to reach a sensitivity and specificity above 75% for detecting alcohol or opioid misuse. We will improve the performance of our baseline, individual NLP single-substance classifiers for alcohol and opioid misuse by implementing multi-label and multi-task machine learning methods. These methods will take advantage of information shared across different types of substance misuse and better capture the state of a patient within a single model. The resulting classifier will be capable of jointly inferring all types of substance misuse (alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, and non-opioid illicit misuse) including polysubstance use, and cater to each individual patient’s substance use treatment needs.  We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 35,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. The top performing classifier will then be tested prospectively to: (1) externally validate its screening performance in a hospital without established screening; and (2) test its effectiveness against usual care at a hospital with questionnaire-based substance misuse screening. We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal screening in hospitalized patients and guiding interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of the substance misuse classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems.

"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,9981021,K99MH118359,"['10 year old', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'artificial neural network', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neural correlate', 'periadolescent', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social factors', 'symptom cluster']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,156897,0.03514698006958721
"Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the leading cause of global disease burden. Associated with over 1,000 different symptom profiles, MDD is highly heterogeneous. The majority of MDD symptom change occurs across hours. Consequently, there is a need to increasingly focus MDD research on personalized assessment of these rapid symptom fluctuations. To date, personalized models of MDD have shown promise, but relied solely on self-report measures. There is thus a critical need to develop personalized models of MDD that incorporate objective signals. Passively collected information from smartphones and wearable sensors can continuously and unobtrusively track behavioral and physiological signals related to core disturbances associated with MDD, including psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbances, social contact, behavioral activation, heart rate variability, and screen time. Preliminary data suggest that personalized artificial intelligence (i.e., personally weighted deep learning models) are well suited for creating novel personalized digital biomarkers of these passive indicators, and that these biomarkers can predict rapid changes in MDD symptoms. This proposal will investigate the ability to develop personalized deep learning models of rapid changes in MDD symptoms among a nationally representative sample of 120 treatment seeking adults with MDD across 90 days using passively collected data from smartphones and wearable sensors. This proposal aims to test the accuracy of personalized, subtyped, and cohort-based modeling techniques and uncover personalized digital biomarkers of moment-to-moment changes in MDD symptoms. The project proposes the following innovations: it will (1) conduct the first passive-sensing study of MDD in a nationally-representative cohort; (2) utilize deep learning models to aid in the discovery of novel maintenance factors of MDD symptom changes; and (3) use personalized multimodal assessments of MDD to address the heterogeneity in MDD. In line with the aims of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this project will study MDD symptom changes across multiple units of analysis and integrate multiple systems. This study will provide a critical step towards uncovering novel personalized maintenance patterns of MDD symptom changes in daily life. Further, it will allow for scalable personalized treatments to be developed using technology to deliver behavioral interventions in the moments immediately preceding rapid MDD symptom changes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to utilize personalized artificial intelligence techniques and objective data (collected from smartphones and wearable devices) to create individualized digital biomarkers of rapid changes in major depressive disorder symptoms. This is important because, if we were to uncover personalized patterns between objectively measured physiology and behavioral changes and understand their resulting impact on rapid fluctuations in major depressive disorder symptoms, we would be able to define new, person-specific maintenance patterns that underlie the wide-ranging heterogeneity that is currently seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Moreover, these advancements will provide a crucial step forward towards developing personalized, scalable, technology-based interventions that will be able to be delivered immediately (and, ideally, before rapid symptom changes) among those persons with major depressive disorder.",Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices,10029386,R01MH123482,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Devices', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analog', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'microphone', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenomenological models', 'premature', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tv watching', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,250435,0.0022538856409480877
"Data-driven models of symptom heterogeneity to empower transdiagnostic multimodal biomarker discovery in mood disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT My goal is to pursue an independent career in computational psychiatry by leveraging cutting-edge neuroimaging and data-driven analysis approaches to advance precision medicine in mental health. To build on my strong neuroimaging and computational background, the training component of this award emphasizes coursework and mentorship in the clinical and behavioral aspects of psychopathology. I will also receive mentorship to advance my theoretical and applied understanding of deep learning in this burgeoning field. The overarching research goal in this proposal is to develop computational strategies that account for the heterogeneity of mood disorders to improve the identification of treatment-response biomarkers. Response to pharmaceutical and behavioral antidepressant treatments is low, likely due to the symptomatic and etiological heterogeneity of depression whereby certain treatments may confer differential benefits for patients having particular symptom constellations. In the K99 phase, I will seek to improve prediction of individual antidepressant response using electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which elicits robust and rapid antidepressant effects, as the treatment model. I will use MRI and clinical data from patients undergoing ECT collected for the large the Global ECT-MRI Research Collaboration (GEMRIC). In Aim 1, I will use exploratory factor analysis to characterize latent symptom dimensions of the GEMRIC cohort before, during, and after ECT. The accuracy of predicting clinical outcomes along the recovered symptom dimensions will be compared to traditional means of evaluating response using the total score of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Pursuit of this aim will expand my understanding of clinical psychiatry and lay foundational knowledge for the independent aims. Aim 2 will expand my deep learning and multimodal neuroimaging skillsets as I develop novel deep learning architectures to fuse multimodal imaging features of GEMRIC participants to further improve predictions of treatment response and cognitive impairment following ECT. Rather than simply concatenating multimodal features together, deep network architectures will discover latent feature representations. The R00 phase will be a logical progression of the skill sets I develop in the mentored phase and expand on these lines of research. Aim 3 will draw from a collection of large-scale MRI datasets from patients with more broadly defined mood disorders to identify multimodal imaging markers associated with transdiagnostic symptom domains. Aim 4 uses treatment groups from aim 3, including patients undergoing ketamine, sleep deprivation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and pharmaceuticals, to explore the extent to which biomarkers of therapeutic response, defined along the transdiagnostic symptom dimensions identified in Aim 3, are shared across treatment groups. I anticipate that discrete categorizations of mood disorders artificially obscures discovery of treatment-response biomarkers. Fulfillment of these aims will simultaneously propel me to independence and yield important insight into the treatment of heterogeneous mood disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mood disorders including depression, bipolar, and post-traumatic stress disorder constitute the world's leading cause of disability and their burden is increasing. This proposal seeks to mitigate the burden of these related mood disorders by identifying patterns of brain structure and function indicative of a patient's likelihood of benefiting from various related interventions. This research has the potential to inform more personalized treatment strategies than are currently available and will likely further inform development of precision interventions targeting mood disorders.",Data-driven models of symptom heterogeneity to empower transdiagnostic multimodal biomarker discovery in mood disorders,10011838,K99MH119314,"['Anhedonia', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Etiology', 'Factor Analysis', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Ketamine', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleeplessness', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'antidepressant effect', 'anxious', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker identification', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'electric field', 'hippocampal morphometry', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'network architecture', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support vector machine', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2020,102857,0.02197310298152111
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason for this is that most neuroimaging prediction studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple correlation relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, nonlinear relationships, or multi-site cross-validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with reference, and sparse regression can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, providing promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers and going beyond a descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain disease to individualized prediction. We will facilitate the translational biomarker identification by developing 3 novel data-driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment may affect covarying brain function and structure in mental disorder, by using different clinical measures as a reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction framework with aggregated feature selection techniques that is able to estimate clinical outcome more precisely, e.g., remission/relapse status of individual MDD patient after electroconvulsive treatment(ECT) using baseline brain imaging and demographic measures of 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep learning combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) or attention modules, to classify multiple groups of psychiatric disorders by incorporating dynamic functional measures. The proposed (Deep/Recurrent/Convolutional Neural Network, DNN/RNN/CNN) models will have enhanced interpretability that is able to trace back and discover the most predictive functional networks from input. All above proposed methods will be applied to big data containing both multimodal imaging and behavioral information (n~5000) pooled from existing studies, and our developed open-source toolboxes will be shared publicly. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, leading to earlier and more effective interventions, and laying the groundwork for a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep learning, supervised learning and functional dynamics, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, and to identify precise biomarkers that are able to predict clinical measures for new individuals and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting of a big data with imaging and behavioral info to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9999673,R01MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,395331,0.009325117960780272
"The Development and Systematic Evaluation of an AI-Assisted Just-in-Time-Adaptive-Intervention for Improving Child Mental Health PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Early childhood mental health problems constitute a significant public health concern with wide-ranging impacts on functioning both concurrently and later in life. Although childhood mental health is influenced by a variety of factors, the quality of relationships with caregivers plays a critical role. Critical, coercive, and conflictual parent- child interactions have been consistently linked with increased risk of externalizing and internalizing symptoms, whereas supportive and nurturing relationships have been shown to confer protective effects. Early intervention of maladaptive family relationships is thus crucial for preventing or offsetting negative developmental trajectories in at-risk children. A variety of therapeutic methods have been developed and employed to foster positive parent- child relationships and improve child mental health, including parent training/education, in-person therapy, home visiting, school curriculums, and web programs. However, systematic obstacles interfere with the accessibility, generalizability, and acceptability of these traditional appointment- and module-based approaches. Furthermore, limitations in the family-centered flexibility, individual responsiveness, and broad availability of these services render them inadequate to address the unique needs of at-risk populations who would benefit from more readily accessible and inexpensive 24-hour support that is provided in real time and real life—when and where support is needed most. Not surprisingly, research finds that roughly half of the families who do participate in traditional appointment- and module-based mental health services fail to show sufficient symptom improvement. Just-in- time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), in contrast, utilize smartphones, wearables, and artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and respond to psychological and behavioral processes and contextual events as they unfold in everyday life. Although JITAIs have the potential to transform the way people receive mental health support, barriers to their successful, wide-scale implementation remain. Using pilot data collected from smartphones and wearables, our interdisciplinary team of psychologists and engineers used AI to build machine learning algorithms to detect psychological states and contextual events, such as ongoing moods and relationship conflict, in couples. In the current project, we propose developing and testing a JITAI to provide opportune supports to families in dynamic response to contextual events and shifting psychological states to amplify attachment bonds, regulate emotion, and intervene in maladaptive parent-child interactional patterns. Building on our prior research, we will (1) build software to unobtrusively capture real-time data from commercially-available mobile devices, (2) use machine learning to develop algorithms to automatically monitor psychological and behavioral processes relevant to child mental health, (3) launch a JITAI to provide as-needed intervention, and (4) carry out a micro-randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of our JITAI for decreasing child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Our project will contribute to the development of technology ecosystems and service delivery models with the power to meaningfully transform the accessibility and dynamic responsiveness of mental health care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mental health problems in childhood are highly prevalent and impairing, placing an immense social and economic burden on society. Parent-child relationships in the early years of life play a critical role in promoting child mental health, with critical and coercive relationships increasing the risk of mental health problems across the lifespan.

"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). This node will draw on an experienced set of investigators who have active collaborations and represent all of the major academic medical centers in the Greater Chicago and Wisconsin areas. The node will serve as a vital Midwestern hub for the CTN and will expand on the success of the CTN approach. In addition, the GLN will bring substantial experience in adolescent/young adult research, seniors/aging research, digital & mobile technologies, opioid misuse, collaborative care/population health, telehealth, and electronic health record and systems-driven interventions and research methodologies. The GLN will support engagement with CTN protocols and also add the following: Aim 1: GLN will identify and recommend substance misuse research and intervention protocols focused on systems-based practice using hospital-based screening, collaborative care, and population approaches. Aim 2: We will establish a digital and computation health core that will leverage our expertise in these domains and serve as a conduit for studies in mHealth, eHealth, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and telehealth interventions. Aim 3: Our node will bring substantial expertise with youth/adolescent health and seniors/aging that will enable us to recommend studies to the CTN that examine the genesis of substance misuse and the potential for prevention strategies to mitigate these life-course pathways. Aim 4: In alignment with our team’s expertise, we plan to support work on substance and opioid misuse that focuses on health disparities including socioeconomic, geographic, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Aim 5: Leveraging our experience in professional education and practice-based learning, our node will rigorously test the impact of professional education on opioid and substance treatment. We have built on the ECHO model to develop methods to conduct high-quality distance education and supported training that are currently being trialed in Illinois with plans to expand these programs nationally. Aim 6: GLN will expand the pipeline of early investigators interested in substance misuse research. We will align this part of our program with our very successful CTSA-supported programs and build specific subprogramming that supports addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship.

"Study of a PST-Trained Voice-Enabled Artificial Intelligence Counselor (SPEAC) for Adults with Emotional Distress PROJECT SUMMARY BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are the leading causes of disability and lost productivity, and are often underdiagnosed and undertreated owing to access, cost, and stigma barriers. Novel and scalable psychotherapies are urgently needed. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer a transformative opportunity to develop intelligent voice assistants as virtual health agents accessible on personal devices. Meanwhile, major advances in human neuroscience have fueled a paradigm shift to study brain mechanisms underlying behavioral health interventions. OBJECTIVES: Leveraging our collaborative team’s transdisciplinary expertise in these emerging areas, we will develop and rigorously test a novel voice-enabled, AI virtual agent named Lumen, trained on Problem Solving Therapy (PST), for patients with moderate, untreated depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. We will investigate the effect of Lumen on engagement of a priori neural targets—amygdala for emotional reactivity and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for cognitive control—as putative mechanisms. DESIGN/ METHODS: The project has 2 phases. In the R61 phase (years 1-2), we will further develop Lumen building on the current prototype and conduct iterative user-centered design evaluations that include focus groups, scenario-based clinician evaluations, and a formative user study with 20 participants. We will pilot test Lumen in a 2-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT, Study 1), with 60 participants with depression and/or anxiety randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive PST with Lumen (n=40) on a secure study iPad or be on a waitlist (n=20). At weeks 0 and 14, participants will complete functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess neural target engagement as well as validated surveys of patient-reported outcomes (e.g., depressive and anxiety symptoms, functioning, quality of life). In addition, they will complete naturalistic end-of-day assessments of mood, stress, appraisal and coping for 7 days every 2 weeks. If the Go milestone criteria are met, the R33 phase (years 3-5) will include a 3-arm RCT (Study 2) with 200 new participants randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 arms: Lumen (n=100), waitlist control (n=50), and in-person PST as active control (n=50). Participants will complete baseline and follow-up assessments using a refined measurement protocol based on Study 1. SPECIFIC AIMS: R61 aims are to (1) establish the functionality, usability, and treatment fidelity of Lumen; and (2) demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and neural target engagement according to pre-specified Go milestone criteria. R33 aims are to (1) confirm neural target engagement by a superiority test (primary) comparing the Lumen and waitlist control arms and a noninferiority test (secondary) comparing the Lumen and in-person PST arms; and (2) examine the relationships of target engagement to outcomes. The results will provide the basis for future confirmatory efficacy testing of Lumen. IMPACT: This project’s public health impact lies in that a mechanistically tested, PST-trained AI agent could bring proven psychotherapy to people with depression/anxiety who do not seek professional help or who desire more personalized, connected care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression and anxiety are the leading causes of disability and lost productivity and are often underdiagnosed and undertreated due to access, cost, and stigma barriers, highlighting the pressing need for novel means of treatment delivery with the potential of reaching many who otherwise would not have access to mental health services. To address this unmet need, this project will develop a voice-enabled, artificial intelligence (AI) agent named Lumen, trained in Problem Solving Therapy (PST) and accessible on secure study iPads. The project will rigorously test the effects of Lumen on brain circuits affecting emotional reactivity and cognitive control, which are related to depressive and anxiety symptoms; results will have high potential for significant clinical and public health impact.",Study of a PST-Trained Voice-Enabled Artificial Intelligence Counselor (SPEAC) for Adults with Emotional Distress,10031359,R61MH119237,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Focus Groups', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Resources', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Intelligence', 'Lateral', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Moods', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process Measure', 'Productivity', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Voice Training', 'Waiting Lists', 'active control', 'active method', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'base', 'behavioral health intervention', 'clinical decision support', 'cognitive control', 'coping', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'emotional distress', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'formative assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intelligent agent', 'iterative design', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'novel', 'problem solving therapy', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social stigma', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'treatment arm', 'treatment optimization', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R61,2020,2112494,0.012059520164567667
"Leveraging interactive SMS messaging to monitor and support maternal mental health in Kenya ABSTRACT Perinatal depression, defined as a depressive episode during pregnancy or in the first year postpartum, is the most common complication of childbirth, affecting up to 20% of peripartum women globally. An enormous gap exists in supporting women experiencing perinatal depression. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions such as interactive SMS text messaging with healthcare workers (HCWs) have been proposed as resource-efficient, accessible adjuncts to in-person care. Realizing the full public health potential of mHealth for mental health will require strategic use of automation and empiric definition of interventions that dynamically adapt to user needs. This K18 mentored career enhancement award aims to support Dr. Keshet Ronen, an epidemiologist with multidisciplinary training, to become an expert in analysis of mHealth communication and development of adaptive mHealth interventions. Building on Dr. Ronen’s established expertise in development and evaluation of mHealth interventions using SMS and social media, and supported by a team of experienced mentors, the following research and training aims are proposed. Training plan: Through didactic coursework, individual mentor meetings, seminars, and conferences, Dr. Ronen seeks to accomplish the following Career Enhancement Goals. (1) Gain proficiency and experience using natural language processing and machine learning methods to analyze mHealth communication. (2) Gain proficiency and experience in design of an adaptive mHealth intervention. (3) Deepen understanding of mHealth intervention design for mental health. (4) Enhance skills in international study implementation and clinical trial design. The proposed training plan will augment Dr. Ronen’s prior training and experience and allow her to complete the proposed Research plan: Mobile WACh is a unique interactive SMS messaging platform that has been shown to improve maternal-child health and whose impact on perinatal depression is currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in Kenya, Mobile WACh Neo. We propose to leverage a dataset of >100,000 SMS messages with >3000 peripartum women in previous and ongoing Mobile WACh studies to (1) develop a predictive model that can detect client SMS indicating elevated depression symptoms, and (2) identify HCW message characteristics associated with improvements in depression symptoms. (3) Models from Aims 1-2 will be implemented in the Mobile WACh software to develop an adaptive version of Mobile WACh Neo that flags concerning messages and guides HCWs on SMS composition. A pilot study of Adaptive Mobile WACh Neo will be conducted, nested within the Mobile WACh Neo randomized controlled trial in Kenya (R01HD098105), to evaluate its acceptability and preliminary impact on time taken for HCWs to respond to client messages. Collectively, these activities will enable Dr. Ronen to become a leader in the study of adaptive mHealth interventions to support maternal mental health in resource-limited settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression is the most common complication of pregnancy, but it is undertreated due to lack of mental healthcare resources and barriers to in-person care. Short message service (SMS) text messaging is a promising tool to support mental health in the high-risk peripartum period. This project aims to use natural language processing and machine learning to develop an adaptive SMS intervention that supports healthcare workers to deliver effective SMS messages to support perinatal depression.",Leveraging interactive SMS messaging to monitor and support maternal mental health in Kenya,9976950,K18MH122978,"['Affect', 'Automation', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childbirth', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Complication', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Contraceptive Usage', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusive Breastfeeding', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health Communication', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Hybrid Computers', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-18 conjugate', 'Kenya', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'adaptive intervention', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implementation trial', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'open source', 'peripartum depression', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'response', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social media', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K18,2020,59313,-0.005689284737365571
"SCH: INT: Computational Tools for Avoidaint/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder  Intellectual Merit: This project will for the first time provide the fundamental tools to integrate unique multimodal data toward screening, diagnosis, and intervention in eating disorders, with an initial focus on children with ARFID and related developmental and health disorders. This work is critical for enriching the understanding of healthy development and for broadening the foundations of behavioral data science. ARFID ·motivates the development of new computer vision and data analysis tools critical for the analysis of multidimensional behavioral data. The main aims are: 1. Develop and user individualized and integrated continuous facial affect coding from videos to discern affective motivations for food avoidance, critical due to the unique sensory aspects of eating disorders, and resulting from active stimulation via friendly and carefully designed images/videos and real food presentation; 2. Use data analysis and machine learning to derive sensory profiles based on patterns of food consumption and preference from existing unique datasets of selective eaters; and 3. Translate the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 into the clinic and home to assess the capacity of these tools to define a threshold of clinically significant food avoidance, to detect change in acceptability of food with repeated presentations, and to examine and modify the accuracy of our food suggestion algorithms. Broader Impacts: The impact of this application comprises two broad domains. First is the derivation of processes, tools, and strategies to analyze very disparate data across multiple levels of analysis and to codify those strategies to inform similar future work, in particular incorporating automatic behavioral coding. Second is the exploitation of these tools to address questions about the emergence of healthy/unhealthy food selectivity across the lifespan, including recommendation delivery via apps and at-home recordings.

"Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life ABSTRACT: Emotion regulation (ER) is a key transdiagnostic process and treatment target, with particular relevance to distress disorders (depression, generalized anxiety disorder). Distress disorders, which are characterized by heightened negative emotions, are prevalent conditions with considerable public health burden and comparatively lower response to treatment. The efficacy of interventions for distress disorders may be improved by investigating components of effective ER, both as instructed in the lab (ER capacity) and as measured naturalistically in daily life (ER tendency). Effective ER is based on key components such as accurate perceptions of one's emotions (i.e., emotional awareness) as well sensitivity to the environmental context (i.e., contextual sensitivity), which facilitate the selection and implementation of the appropriate ER strategy. For individuals with distress disorders, elevated levels of perseverative negative thinking (PNT) interferes with these processes, contributing to ER deficits and increased symptoms. This contextualized and integrative model of ER in distress disorders has not been tested, and very little is known about the predictors or outcomes of effective ER tendency—a critical gap given that ER capacity is irrelevant if ER is not employed skillfully in daily life. Furthermore, examinations of ER tendency can show how individuals, considering their particular characteristics and abilities, can optimally match particular ER strategies to the specific situations they encounter. The goal of this application is to evaluate components of ineffective ER— both in the lab and in daily life— that influence the severity and course of distress disorders and functioning. Consistent with NIMH strategic objectives and the RDoC framework, this project incorporates multimodal assessment, dimensional symptom measurement, and machine learning approaches. The proposed study will be comprised of 300 adults, oversampled for elevated PNT (50%). Participants will complete a lab assessment to measure predictors of ER capacity, followed by a 10- day ecological momentary assessment study examining predictors of ER tendency in daily life. To better capture negative emotions as they occur, reports in daily life will be physiologically-triggered with algorithms that detect potential episodes of psychological stress. Effective ER will be operationalized in multiple ways in the lab and in daily life, using self-reported changes in affect, physiological indices, and perceived ER success. Effective ER capacity and tendency will then be examined as predictors of distress symptom, functioning, and well-being trajectories assessed monthly for 12 months. Additionally, an exploratory aim is to create predictive models from a multifaceted battery of theoretically motivated variables that impact ER tendency and subsequent clinical outcomes. To this end, machine learning will be used to build a clinically-relevant framework for how person- level, situation-level, and ER strategy use interact to predict optimal ER. Overall, this project contributes to the long-term goal of identifying and refining targets for personalized interventions, by more precisely isolating key mechanisms of effective ER for specific individuals and the contexts they encounter in their daily lives. Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine predictors (i.e., emotional awareness, contextual sensitivity, perseverative negative thinking) of dysfunctional emotion regulation that contribute to depression and anxiety, as well as to provide an initial framework for optimal emotion regulation in individualized daily life contexts. This study uses multiple measurements (behavioral, psychophysiological, self-report, clinical interview) in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings in daily life, and it focuses on dimensional and transdiagnostic features that underlie multiple disorders. Consistent with NIMH's mission, findings will be relevant to public health because they can help refine intervention targets and inform personalized treatment for depression and anxiety, which are common and impairing conditions.",Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life,9993553,R01MH118218,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Applications Grants', 'Arousal', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'comparative', 'emotion regulation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'random forest', 'response', 'success', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA,R01,2020,441529,-0.007600908497031674
"Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals Project Summary/Abstract The main goal of this study is to build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system that can inform effective recruitment and retention strategies to prevent excessive turnover. High turnover rates (estimated 25-60% annually) are devastating for mental health care systems, affecting organizations (e.g., cost), employees (e.g., work well-being), and most critically, the quality of care. Human resource departments collect extensive employee data that can be useful predictors for turnover, but these data are not often analyzed to address turnover issues in mental health organizations. Computational methods have greatly evolved and can now access and analyze large and complex data. This pilot study will achieve three specific aims: Aim 1: build and test turnover prediction models by developing and applying machine learning algorithms to existing human resource data; Aim 2: generate critical questions to enhance turnover prediction through qualitative methods; and Aim 3: test the enhanced model in predicting turnover at 12 months. In Aim 1, using past human resource data and service encounters from [two mental health organizations (rural and urban locations)], we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict turnover. The algorithms will address turnover questions simultaneously (e.g., Who are the most likely to leave? What factors predict turnover at varying time points in employment?). In Aim 2, we will interview key informants: “leavers” (employees who voluntarily terminate employment during the study); “stayers” (employees with extreme longevity in the organization); and “predictees” (identified as likely to leave, based on our algorithms). The findings will be discussed in two focus groups in order to generate, refine, and validate 5-10 critical questions to enhance prediction of turnover. In Aim 3, we will conduct an on-line survey of all current employees to assess the 5-10 critical questions and link survey data with data from human resources and services to examine the improved precision between the theory-based model (predictors in the survey) and the data-driven model (machine learning algorithms) in predicting actual turnover 12 months later. Machine learning can model complex and dynamic variable relationships (e.g., handling a large number of variables, accounting for heterogeneity) and overcome limitations in traditional turnover research that often relies on small, cross-sectional, and convenience samples. Successful completion of this study will promote data-driven, evidence-based organizational management practices to address turnover, which is aligned with NIMH priorities of capitalizing on existing data structures and using technologies to improve mental health service quality. This study will be a critical step in developing highly adaptable machine learning algorithms to predict turnover; ultimately, we envision that this system will be partnered with future clinical interventions to reduce turnover in mental health. Project Narrative This pilot study will build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system to inform effective recruitment and retention strategies for preventing excessive employee turnover in mental health organizations. Successful retention of a quality workforce not only helps mental health organizations and their employees, but also directly impacts the quality of care that clients receive. In addition, a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system could be partnered with clinical interventions to reduce turnover.",Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals,9895943,R34MH119411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Mental Health Centers', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Effectiveness', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personnel Turnover', 'Pilot Projects', 'Practice Management', 'Predictive Factor', 'Productivity', 'Professional Burnout', 'Psyche structure', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'burnout', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'data resource', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'heterogenous data', 'human data', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental health organization', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'retention rate', 'rural area', 'structured data', 'theories', 'treatment services', 'urban area']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R34,2020,244635,0.027764854885452585
"Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Substance use and substance use disorder are leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Importantly, most adults with substance use disorder begin using substances as adolescents, making adolescence an important period for the development of substance use disorder. Thus, it is critical to identify factors related to substance use among adolescents, consistent with NIDA objective 1.1. One factor linked to adolescent substance use is negative emotion processing. As adolescents undergo significant biological and psychosocial changes across development they may experience altered negative emotion processing that can lead to substance use if not appropriately regulated. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding in how neural level differences in negative emotion processing is related to substance use among adolescents. Moreover, extant neuroimaging research on negative emotion processing and substance use has employed univariate methods instead of multivariate methods. In contrast to univariate methods, multivariate methods are more sensitive in detecting patterns of neural activation across voxels and yield more generalizable and replicable findings overall. In addition, this research has employed standardized negative emotion paradigms, which have high experimental control, but may be less likely to reflect negative emotion processing as it occurs in the real world. To address these gaps in the literature, the proposed study will use multivariate machine learning approaches (i.e., multivoxel pattern analysis) to classify patterns of neural activation in a standardized negative emotion processing task and in a novel naturalistic negative emotion processing task that differentiate substance using adolescents from non-using adolescents, as well as predict substance use disorder risk factors. Additionally, the proposed study will use machine learning approaches to examine sex differences in emotion-related neural activation to these tasks in relation to substance use. This research will be conducted on a sample of 326 12-13 year old adolescents from Sponsor’s (Chaplin) competing renewal grant (RO1 DA033431-06A1). Knowledge from the proposed study will be used to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of adolescent substance use. Ultimately, these markers can be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished within a research training plan aimed at developing multidisciplinary expertise in affective neuroscience, particularly in multivariate machine learning methods, and developmental models of substance use. The training plan includes completion of relevant coursework, attendance at targeted workshops, individual mentorship by experts in the field of development and neuroscience, and scientific writing and presentation experience. Project Narrative  This project uses machine learning fMRI approaches to investigate patterns of neural activation during negative emotion processing to classify and predict adolescent substance use. The goal of this research is to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of substance use. This knowledge will be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts.",Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents,9991091,F31DA051154,"['13 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Initiation Factors', 'Persons', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Change', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Writing', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'affective neuroscience', 'boys', 'cingulate cortex', 'critical period', 'disability', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'early adolescence', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'girls', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'social stressor', 'substance use prevention', 'substance using adolescents']",NIDA,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,38803,0.008105786209721232
"Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping Symptom-based classification approaches based on the DSM 5 are often not supported by epidemiological, genetic, and clinical neuroimaging research and may impede the advancement of interventions that target the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health disorders. A novel alternative to classifying psychopathology based on presenting clinical symptoms is to identify neurobiologically-informed biotypes. Individuals are clustered according to shared patterns of brain dysfunction using data-driven machine learning techniques to reveal the heterogeneous biological mechanisms that underlie comorbid disorders. Internalizing symptoms often first begin during development, suggesting that this is a critical period of vulnerability. Additionally, strong sex differences are found in anxiety and depressive symptoms, starting in adolescence. Thus, studies are needed that examine sex differences in the neurobiological mechanisms associated with internalizing symptoms during development. The purpose of the current study is to uncover the neurobiological heterogeneity associated with internalizing symptoms in youth. During the K99 phase, Aim 1 will use machine-learning techniques to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity among youth with anxiety and depressive disorders using multimodal neuroimaging data from a large community-based sample of over 1,200 youth studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; Training phase). We will test these heterogeneous patterns on a hold-out sample from the same cohort to examine the model’s validity (Validation phase). While the PNC provides an ideal dataset for developing a model, it does not have paradigms relevant to fear and anxiety that would allow us to identify important phenotypic differences between biotypes. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the generalizability of this model in an independent sample collected during the R00 phase, and further characterize these biotypes using pertinent measures related to error and reward processing. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate how sex differences in brain development associate with heterogeneous neural patterns in internalizing symptoms. Dr. Kaczkurkin’s long-term goal is to establish an independent research program where she will use advanced multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to study the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders in youth. This study will provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on the PNC database at the University of Pennsylvania to develop a well-validated model while also collecting a refined independent dataset, which will provide Dr. Kaczkurkin with the training and experience needed to transition to an independent research career. This study will provide critical knowledge regarding the neurobiological heterogeneity in youth with mood and anxiety disorders. A greater comprehension of how abnormalities in brain function give rise to these symptoms in adolescence is critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. Such knowledge would benefit public health by reducing the costs and burden of internalizing symptoms on the society at large.",Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping,9994407,R00MH117274,"['Adolescence', 'Affective', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Atrophic', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Phobias', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'critical period', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'male', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'programs', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'reward processing', 'supervised learning']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,243129,0.03333715329044319
"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal care provided to the pregnant members of a large regional healthcare system.",Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App,9892136,R21MH119450,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disclosure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure to Thrive', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postpartum Depression', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Psychometrics', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'fetal', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'motherhood', 'natural language', 'patient subsets', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'pregnant', 'racial disparity', 'response', 'routine screening', 'smartphone Application', 'social culture', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2020,233832,-0.02203846790120339
"Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature Project Summary/Abstract Symptom-based diagnoses of mental illness are highly comorbid, biologically heterogeneous, and poorly predictive of treatment response. The National Institute of Mental Health has led efforts to redefine mental illness by its biological causes, establishing the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as a guide for investigating variation in basic brain systems. RDoC has been influential, named in hundreds of grants and publications, but it has yet to be systematically validated. It is unknown whether circuit-function links underlying the RDoC brain systems are reproducible across studies, and organizing principles remain largely untested. While the structure of RDoC as a modular hierarchy has evidence in resting state analyses, it has not been shown whether this applies to systems that support the diverse mental states affected in psychiatric disease. It is necessary to validate RDoC, and moreover, to establish fundamental principles of organization for systems defined jointly by human brain structure and function. The objective of this proposal is to apply large- scale computational neuroimaging meta-analyses to build a data-driven ontology that will not only serve as a benchmark in evaluating the validity of RDoC but also characterize the architecture of systems for human brain function. The long-term goal is to redefine mental illness by differences from healthy function within the brain systems of a data-driven ontology, facilitating rational targeting of neuromodulation treatments. The proposed meta-analyses will be the most comprehensive in the field with 18,155 MRI and PET studies already collected. The mental functions considered in these studies have been extracted from article texts using natural language processing, and brain circuits will be mapped from the brain coordinate data that were reported. The hypothesis is that brain systems are comprised of reproducible circuit-function links organized into a modular hierarchy, which for some systems will require updates to RDoC. This will be tested by comparing RDoC systems against those of a data-driven ontology. Aim 1: The reproducibility of circuit-function links will be evaluated by the performance of neural network classifiers predicting functions in article texts from circuits in brain scan data, and vice versa. Aim 2: The modularity of brain systems will be evaluated by a graph theoretic approach, and hierarchical structure will be assessed by representational similarity analysis. The impact of this project will be to validate the foremost psychiatry research framework and to characterize human brain systems through an innovative computational strategy. Together with targeted academic training in neurobiology, the fellowship is designed to offer preparation for a career as a physician-scientist leading advances in computational psychiatry. Training will be supported by an environment that combines world-class computing resources with esteemed and engaged mentors in psychiatry, neuroscience, and computer science. Project Narrative First-line treatments routinely fail for most of the 45 million US adults living with mental illness because psychiatric diagnoses lack a biological basis, making them unreliable predictors of treatment response. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a biologically based diagnostic system in psychiatry by characterizing the composition and structure of human brain systems through innovative computational meta-analyses of nearly 20,000 neuroimaging articles. When it is understood what makes up a brain system and how systems are organized, mental illness can be redefined by variation from healthy function, facilitating successful targeting of brain-based treatments.",Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature,9991669,F30MH120956,"['Academic Training', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Base of the Brain', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Cognitive', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Expert Opinion', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Ontology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mental function', 'mental state', 'neural network classifier', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuroregulation', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'system architecture']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,37706,-0.007608843159982743
"Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anxiety disorders in youth are highly prevalent [1] and impairing [2-4]. Left untreated, these disorders confer substantial additional risk for the development of a wide range of negative sequelae, including substance use [5], suicidal ideation and attempts [6], and additional mental health comorbidities [7]. Although several treatments have demonstrated efficacy for anxiety in youth, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), family CBT (FCBT), medication (MED), and combination of CBT and medication (COMB) [8], a meaningful portion of youth are classified as non-responders after a full course of treatment [9]. The identification of baseline predictors and moderators of response is critical to improve treatment efficacy and reduce burden on families. Increased anxiety severity, comorbidity (behavioral problems, depression), and family psychopathology, along with older age, female gender and anxiety diagnosis, have been highlighted as potential predictors and moderators of outcome. However, studies have been underpowered and findings are inconsistent [10]. To date, all studies have taken a traditional analytic approach, which typically provides conservative estimates as a result of imposed explanatory constraints [11]. Machine Learning (ML) represents a promising complementary statistical technique to traditional analyses, given its focus on predictive fit rather than explanatory inference [12] and will facilitate identification of non-linear, complex patterns of predictors and moderators at the individual level [13, 14]. These methods have shown promise in identification of treatment outcome predictors in other medical [e.g., 15-18] and psychiatric samples [e.g., 19-22], but to date have not been implemented in a sample of anxious youth. The proposed project will aggregate datasets from at minimum ten peer-reviewed and published randomized controlled trials (N=1444) and train and validate two models along overlapping features, including (1) demographics, (2) diagnosis, (3) anxiety severity (4) behavioral problems, and (5) family psychopathology. Models will also be used to examine differential response to ICBT, FCBT, MED and COMB. Aggregated data will be uploaded into a centralized dataset, in line with the NIMH RDoC db and NDAR [23] datasets, and then used to predict outcome for individual anxious youth (N=80) completing ICBT and COMB at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple. The aims of this study are consistent with calls issued in the NIMH strategic plan (Objective 3) and will help facilitate the development of person-centered interventions for anxious youth [24]. An individualized approach to treatment is important to further increase treatment efficacy and reduce the financial and emotional burden associated with non-response [25, 26]. A training plan has been designed that consists of mentorship, formal classwork and experiential learning to develop the applicant's expertise in machine learning and dataset aggregation. The proposed study will take place within Temple University's clinical psychology program, which has a successful track record of conducting impactful NIMH-funded research and training research scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although several efficacious treatments have been identified for youth anxiety, there is significant heterogeneity in treatment response and this heterogeneity is poorly understood. To help clarify differences in treatment response and facilitate the development of person-centered interventions, novel and advanced statistical approaches should be implemented using adequately powered datasets. The proposed study will (1) use machine-learning methods to identify predictors and moderators of outcome in an aggregated dataset of at minimum ten Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining youth anxiety treatments (individual and family cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, and combination treatments), (2) create a centralized dataset of aggregated RCTs to foster continued cross-site collaboration and (3) test the model's predictive accuracy at the individual level in a real-world sample.",Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth,9990935,F31MH123038,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Youth', 'active method', 'anxiety treatment', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'childhood anxiety', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'demographics', 'depression model', 'design', 'expectation', 'family burden', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individual variation', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'parental role', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'social anxiety', 'treatment response']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2020,33509,0.03300949566599128
"Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Integrating Clinical and Multimodal Imaging Data to Select Optimal Antidepressant Treatment Summary: The public health burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is immense and current approaches for selecting antidepressant treatment have had limited success. By some estimates, fewer than one in three MDD patients will respond to their prescribed antidepressant and the quest for a treatment that will work is typically characterized by a lengthy course of trial-and-error. The need to identify patient characteristics (biomarkers) that can be used to objectively select personalized antidepressant treatment is clear. Accordingly, large clinical studies like the NIMH-funded Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) study have collected massive amounts of baseline measures including those from various neuroimaging sources in the hope that some can be used to guide antidepressant treatment selection. These data bring with them many statistical challenges that have yet to be effectively addressed. These challenges include (1) dealing with high-dimensionality, (2) handling data missingness, and (3) determining how best to simultaneously model relationships between measures from multiple imaging modalities and the response of interest. The goal of this project is to acquire the essential training and experience to make significant progress in this area by addressing each of these challenges. Aim 1 of this project will employ state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning algorithms and targeted estimation to identify moderators of antidepressant treatment effect using scalar clinical, demographic, and summary neuroimaging data from clinical trials of antidepressant treatments, including EMBARC. Strategies for handling missing data in this context will also be investigated and guidelines on best practices will be proposed. Aim 2 will extend the methods used in Aim 1 and develop user-friendly software to directly incorporate high- dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data into treatment decision rules. Included in this aim will be an investigation into best practices for handling missing high-dimensional imaging data in the context of estimating treatment decision rules. Aim 3 will employ the novel methods developed in Aim 2 and the estimated treatment decision rules will be evaluated and compared with those developed in Aim 1. I have put together a training program that directly supports the completion of these research aims. It includes instruction, mentoring, and hands-on-experience (1) in psychopathology and the neural basis for psychiatric disorders and treatment for those disorders; (2) in the use of neuroimaging data to understand depression and response to antidepressant treatment; (3) in the use of modern algorithms to store, process, manipulate, and analyze big biomedical data like those arising in multimodal neuroimaging studies. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the training, time, and resources to be able to make substantial progress in addressing this important problem and will provide the skills and experience that will be crucial in my transition to an independent investigator. Public Health Relevance Statement: This proposal seeks to advance precision medicine through the development of new statistical methods that integrate clinical, demographic, and high-dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data to estimate treatment decision rules. The proposed research and training are laid out in the context of depression but the statistical tools to be developed will be general enough for constructing treatment decision rules for a wide array of diseases using a variety of data types.

This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",10017030,R01DA048764,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'arm', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'non-compliance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2020,191907,-0.023846368073649392
"Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study Efforts to decipher biological signatures for mental illness now focus increasingly on adolescence, a period of rapid brain development that immediately precedes the peak age of onset for many disorders. Maturation of the cerebral cortex during this time has long been thought to mediate emergence of early symptoms. However, while specific cortical changes have been implicated in a small number of specific syndromes, for the most part, patterns in cortical development that underlie the differentiation of psychopathology remain uncertain. The ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unprecedented opportunity to align emergence of specific patterns of psychopathology with specific changes in cortical maturation. Over the next 5 years, ABCD will obtain annual, standardized measures dimensional psychopathology, and biennial MRI scans, of 11,875 youths across 21 US-based sites, covering age 9 to 16. The proposed studies will leverage this longitudinal design to discover regionally- and temporally-specific features of cortical development that associate with emergence of dimensional psychopathology, and then to relate these patterns to specific profiles of underlying genomic and environmental risk. Analysis of baseline data from age 9-10, included in this application, indicates that psychopathology is in early stages of differentiation, although already strongly related to polygenic risk for child-onset disorders, and to well- established pre- and post-natal environmental insults. Aim 1 of the proposed studies will juxtapose clinical and imaging data from baseline through three follow-up time points, focusing primarily on whether departures from neurotypical age-related cortical thinning trajectories (assessed via intercept, slope, and quadratic indices) associate with emergence of specific dimensions of illness. The precise temporal alignment of clinical and cortical thinning trajectories will take an initial step towards inferring causal relationships, which will be further substantiated through triangulation with genomic (Aim 2) and environmental (Aim 3) risk profiles. Polygenic scoring methods developed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium will be used to determine whether cortical maturation trajectories developed in Aim 1 mediate relationships between genomic risk and emergent dimensional psychopathology. Then, using data from hundreds of environmental measures that canvass participants’ daily activities, nutrition, life stressors, socioeconomic status, family dynamics, neighborhood safety, and numerous other factors, we will use novel machine learning methods to develop profiles of exposomic risk factors that predict emergent dimensional psychopathology, and determine whether cortical maturation patterns mediate the relationship between environmental risk profiles and clinical course. By the conclusion of the proposed studies we hope to establish specific cortical signatures that bridge causal factors with emergent psychopathology in adolescence, and that can be leveraged to develop new preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Adolescence is a critical period for emergence of a range of psychiatric syndromes, as well as for maturation of the cerebral cortex. Investigators have long presumed these events to be linked, potentially in ways that can predict specific clinical outcomes, but until now we have lacked data from sufficiently large, prospective studies to establish definitive or tractable patterns. Leveraging data from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (n=11,875), we will map emergent psychopathology across a range of symptoms to specific patterns of cortical development from age 9 to 16, and anchor these relationships to mediating genomic and environmental risk factors.",Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study,10096054,R01MH124694,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family dynamics', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'critical period', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal', 'psychiatric genomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'standardize measure', 'stressor', 'theories']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,413200,0.010281215923770539
"Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders Project Summary/Abstract Substance use costs society $740 billion dollars each year, placing an enormous burden on our nation’s health care and criminal justice systems. Approximately 85% of incarcerated offenders in the United States have a history of substance use and/or are imprisoned for crimes involving or motivated by alcohol and/or drug use. Incarcerated individuals tend to show poorer outcomes following substance use treatment, and forced abstinence via imprisonment is associated with risk for future substance use, which likely contributes to substance-related antisocial behavior following imprisonment. Over the past few decades, women have been sentenced to prison for drug-related reasons at alarming rates, with a growth rate exceeding that for men. Further, women offenders tend to be impacted more heavily by substance use with co-morbid psychopathology, placing greater demands on the system in terms of substance use and mental health treatments. Using the world’s largest forensic neuroimaging database on women offenders (SWANC-F), this proposal investigates substance use and related antisocial behavior following release from prison in a large sample of women offenders, with a focus on neurobiological mechanisms, to demonstrate the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women. Substance-related antisocial behavior, defined as committing crime(s) related to substance use after release from prison, will be obtained from re-arrest data in institutional files and comprehensive background checks on all women enrolled in the study. A random sample (n = 100) will then be followed-up with via phone to gather data on substance use and obtain supplemental information to corroborate re-arrest data from files and background checks. Employing regression analyses and machine learning/pattern classifier approaches, models will be compared testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic variables, along with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) brain measures, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes of interest in women. Specifically, this proposal seeks to test the extent to which psychiatric and socioeconomic factors confer risk for substance-related antisocial behavior following release from prison in women (Aim 1), and integrates and compares the utility of rsFC brain measures in improving these prediction models (Aim 2). Then, similar methods will be applied to test the prediction of substance use following release from prison (Aim 3). It is expected that psychiatric risk factors and socioeconomic protective factors, as well as rsFC brain measures, will be useful in predicting substance use and related antisocial behavior following incarceration, along with time elapsed between release from prison and initiation of substance use and related behavior. Testing factors that aid in predicting these behaviors in women has the potential to be far-reaching by informing the development of targeted treatments, including those that help to account for sex differences and co-morbid conditions related to substance use. Project Narrative Women represent one of the fastest growing segments of substance users in the United States, with a growth rate of substance-related offending exceeding that of men; however, women continue to be one of the most underserved populations in substance use research. This proposal will compare statistical models testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic factors, along with resting-state functional connectivity in and between cognitive control, decision-making, and reward-processing neural circuitry, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes in women. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women in an effort to help inform future treatment efforts.","Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders",10001326,F31DA047048,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fibrinogen', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prisons', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offender', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'psychopathic personality', 'reward processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'support vector machine']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2020,36051,0.02198999365528118
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders.

"Learning high-dimensional functional connectomes of heterogeneous populations PROJECT SUMMARY Network analysis of brain connectivity, or Connectomics, has emerged as an important interdisciplinary field, making strides in advancing both fundamental scientific knowledge on the structure of the brain, as well as providing insights into the pathology of neurological disorders. Advances in neuroimaging technologies have enabled acquisition of high-resolution datasets on brain activities in normal and diseased populations, while advanced machine learning methods hold promise to obtain data-driven insights into the functional architecture of the brain. Functional connectivity analysis is typically carried out in two steps. First, one estimates a network among different brain regions by studying strengths of associations among the time course of neurophysiological signals for different subjects (patients or healthy controls). Next, one compares the networks between different groups of subjects and seeks network features prevalent in specific groups of interest using statistical methods. Two emerging challenges in this field are the presence of heterogeneity amongst subjects in large study cohorts, and developing predictive models to construct robust and interpretable results. The central goal of this proposal is to address these challenges by developing machine learning methods equipped with uncertainty quantification measures, suitable for high-dimensional network data for heterogeneous populations. Upon completion, these methods are expected to provide automated, robust and more accurate discovery of connectivity patterns that is prevalent in heterogeneous populations of patients. We aim to accomplish this goal by pursuing two specific aims: (1) develop estimation and inference methods for frequency domain measures of high-dimensional functional connectivity networks, (2) develop a framework of mixed effects model of high-dimensional functional connectivity networks that accounts for heterogeneity among subjects and enables discoveries more likely to generalize in large cohorts. For each aim, novel machine learning methods for integrative analysis of structural and functional connectivity will be developed using a mathematical model of network diffusion. We will also calibrate and validate our proposed methods on data from Human Connectome Project, and on multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The proposed approach is innovative since it integrates machinery across diverse disciplines, including statistics, machine learning and network analysis to address important challenges learning large functional connectivity graphs. The proposed research is significant in that it is expected to have both scientific and translational impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding brain connectivity patterns using rigorous machine learning methods can help seek common patterns in large databases in an automated fashion, and can potentially lead to development of neuroimaging based diagnostic tools and sensitive prognostic measures. The proposed research will thus use fundamental scientific knowledge about brain to assist translational research in neurological disease.",Learning high-dimensional functional connectomes of heterogeneous populations,10110789,R21NS120227,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cations', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Interest Group', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain size', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning network', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical model', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neurological pathology', 'neuropathology', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,428417,0.00048323277586889116
"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care.

"Development and clinical validation of multimodal risk algorithms for predicting future internalizing psychopathology I am currently Assistant Professor and a licensed clinical psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Vermont. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator using novel strategies in developmental neuroimaging to study mood and anxiety symptomatology from birth to maturity. Although I have been trained in the analysis of longitudinal structural MRI, I require further training in the processing and analysis of state-of-the-art multiband neuroimaging data that allows for more sensitive measures of brain connectivity. I am also lacking expertise with regard to more sophisticated analytic methods for more fully leveraging large-sample multimodal datasets. Such approaches will enable me to move beyond conventional univariate statistical analyses and prepare me for future Big Data initiatives. During the proposed K08 period, my overarching goal is to develop expertise in the application of machine-learning approaches to multimodal data in order to characterize the most salient psychosocial and brain-based predictors of youth internalizing psychopathology. To achieve these goals, I am pursuing career development and training activities in the following areas: 1) assessment and characterization of psychosocial risk factors; 2) theory and implementation of Big Data methods, including machine learning algorithms and cross-validation strategies; 3) analysis of multiband multimodal brain imaging data using Human Connectome Project pipelines with the aim of more comprehensively assessing aspects of cortico-limbic connectivity; 4) independently running my own neuroimaging research study; and 5) developing and submitting a competitive R01 application. In order to obtain this expertise, I am proposing training activities at several institutions, including the University of Vermont, Harvard Medical School, McGill University, and Oregon Health and Science University. The research project in this K08 proposal aims to produce risk algorithms for a transdiagnostic dimension of psychopathology, using novel machine learning approaches to leverage two of the largest longitudinal neuroimaging samples in the world (IMAGEN and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study). These risk algorithms will subsequently undergo refinement using a new sample of clinic-referred youths that I will recruit from an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Vermont. As part of the project, I will also test the degree to which these algorithms predict treatment response. These data will be used as pilot data for my planned R01 application. Given the methods that I am proposing, this project will be able to detect complex non-linear interactions involving risk factors from a multitude of domains. As a result, this work will inform, and help to delineate, various etiological pathways that ultimately result in internalizing problems. Most importantly, this project could inform early identification and targeted intervention strategies during a critical period for the development of internalizing symptomatology. !

"Generating pro-resilient states through individualized circuit read-write therapeutics Project Summary  Major depressive disorder (MDD) and associated anxiety disorders are the most prevalent and costly mental illnesses in the United States, with health spending on treatment recently exceeding $71 billion per year. It is now well established that MDD represents a spectrum of disorders, but current drug based approaches to treatment are temporally nonselective, and their efficacy varies highly across individuals. In this proposal, we explore a ​novel individualized intervention strategy,​ wherein we aim to prevent and reverse MDD through closed-loop behavioral and neural circuit “tuning”.  While some individuals develop MDD as a result of a stressful life event, other individuals appear more resilient to stress-induced depression. Our goal in this proposal is to leverage recent advances in machine learning to identify and detect specific pro-resilient behaviors and patterns of activation in resilient individuals, and then use these data to “steer” susceptible individuals into pro-resilient states.  We will accomplish this in two phases. In the first phase, we will test whether modification of behavior alone can generate a pro-resilient state. We will take a novel quantitative approach to behavior analysis, using machine learning to identify specific micro behaviors that are unique to resilient individuals during a chronic social stress. Then, to test whether promoting these behaviors can provide depression-protective effects, we will then use a closed-loop strategy to detect ongoing behavior, and reinforce identified pro-resilient micro behaviors. Second, we will perform circuit-wide calcium recordings in the brain’s subcortical social behavior network and perform unsupervised detection of pro-resilience circuit motifs across the population. We will then use a novel closed-loop read-write strategy to optogentically “tune” the circuit dynamics to mimic these pro-resilient states. We will further explore how these interventions can be accomplished at various time points relative to a stressful life event (before, during, and after) to test whether circuit intervention can potentially provide protective or restorative treatment.  These data can potentially be used to develop novel behavior-based therapies for MDD, or to significantly refine the current use of deep-brain stimulation in order to generate pro-resilient states. Depression and associated anxiety disorders are the most prevalent and costly mental illnesses in the United States, and current drug-based approaches to treatment are expensive, temporally nonspecific, and often ineffective. Here, we propose to explore whether we can prevent and reverse outcomes associated with stress-induced depression through a novel individualized closed-loop intervention strategy. To do this, we will leverage recent advances in machine learning to longitudinally track the behaviors and underlying neural dynamics of “super resilient” individuals who are resistant to stress-induced depression and reinforce these behavior-based patterns in depressed individuals in order to promote pro-resilience states.",Generating pro-resilient states through individualized circuit read-write therapeutics,10002574,DP2MH126375,"['Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Resistance', 'Social Behavior', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'Writing', 'base', 'cost', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'reinforced behavior', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'resilient behavior', 'restorative treatment', 'social stress']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,DP2,2020,2430000,-0.04195210359086026
"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,9836889,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'algorithm development', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'kernel methods', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,563046,0.03138919056906619
"Buprenorphine Effect on Suicidal Behavior Mortality and morbidity related to suicidal behavior and opioid use disorder (OUD) have increased significantly over the past decade. These two public health crises are intertwined at multiple levels.  Medications for OUD, especially buprenorphine, have the potential to decrease illicit opioid use and reduce the multiple negative consequences of OUD, including fatal and nonfatal overdose, criminal justice involvement, infectious complications, and misuse of other substances. In addition, several small randomized trials of buprenorphine treatment in treatment-resistant depression (with or without co-occurring OUD) suggest that buprenorphine may reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. No conceivable randomized trial, however, would be large enough to assess effects of buprenorphine on suicidal behavior.  Consequently, we propose a large observational study to evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with OUD, including those with and without co- occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We propose to assemble data from four MHRN health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million. This work will take advantage of methods successfully implemented in previous MHRN research and research by our HCSRN Addictions Research Network.  Valid causal inference will require appropriate methods to account for confounding by indication (i.e. people with OUD treated with buprenorphine have higher or lower pre-existing risk of suicidal behavior than people not treated with buprenorphine). Choice of the optimal method will depend on patterns observed in actual data (e.g. rates and correlates of buprenorphine use), but we anticipate considering the following: • Propensity-score matching using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Propensity-score weighting using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Disease risk score adjustment using machine learning-derived suicide risk prediction scores Using this data resource and these analytic methods, we will address the following specific questions: 1) Overall effect: Among people with recognized OUD, how does initiation of buprenorphine treatment affect  risk of suicidal behavior over the following 90 days compared to risk among otherwise similar people with  OUD not initiating buprenorphine treatment? 2) Heterogeneity of effect: Does any effect of initiating buprenorphine vary according to:  a. Means or mechanism of suicidal behavior (opioid overdose vs. other overdose vs. self-injury)?  b. Presence/absence of co-occurring mood disorder or severe mental illness? 3) Specificity of effect: Are effects observed for buprenorphine also observed for alternative medications for treatment of OUD (e.g. naltrexone)? This large observational study will evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with opioid use disorder, including those with and without co-occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We will use comprehensive health records data from four large health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million. Analyses will examine overall effect of buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicide attempt or death, heterogeneity of effects in patient subgroups, and specificity of effects to buprenorphine vs other medications.",Buprenorphine Effect on Suicidal Behavior,10136935,U19MH121738,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Buprenorphine', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Naltrexone', 'Observational Study', 'Overdose', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Specificity', 'Suicide attempt', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Translations', 'Weight', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'World Health', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'buprenorphine treatment', 'chronic pain', 'data resource', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'health record', 'high risk', 'illicit opioid', 'member', 'mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid tapering', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'prescription opioid', 'randomized trial', 'risk prediction model', 'severe mental illness', 'social factors', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment-resistant depression']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U19,2020,514616,-0.06444961541108213
"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,9994388,R00MH110570,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'teacher', 'time use', 'treatment response']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,242813,0.0013410659951886763
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth.

"Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder ABSTRACT This application represents our ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of substance use disorders (SUDs). This research is achieved through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data that combine clinical symptoms and diagnoses, imaging markers, and genotypes. The team has a PI with expertise in computational science and the development and implementation of innovative statistical algorithms to understand multidimensional data; a PI with extensive experience in systems, imaging and addiction neuroscience; and a co-I who has expertise in the genetics of SUDs. Our previous R01 project employed a sample of ~12,000 individuals aggregated from multiple genetic studies of alcohol and drug dependence to generate SUD subtypes based on clinical symptoms. Because clinical manifestations are distal endpoints in the biological pathway, the genetic effects identified are often weak and inconsistent, and consequently difficult to detect even in large samples. As championed by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) research, the etiologies of psychiatric disorders, including SUDs, can be fruitfully characterized by dimensional neural features. This project thus extends our ongoing work to include imaging neural features in the classification of SUDs. Specifically, we will utilize a large database from the UK Biobank Project that provides both genetic and multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Building on our work with the US Human Connectome Project, we aim in the current project to integrate clinical, imaging, and genotype data to investigate the neurobiological substrates of SUD diagnostic labels, and to derive SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. Methodologically, we replace the classic statistical analysis that is confirmatory and biased to an a priori hypothesis by an approach that emphasizes pattern discoveries from big data. Our specific aims are to: (I): identify neuroimaging features that represent robust markers of addiction and differentiate SUD subtypes that can be confirmed by multi-modality evidence; (II) employ a novel brain connectivity model, on the basis of graph convolutional neural networks, to identify neural markers that precisely characterize the differences in structural changes and functional circuits related to SUDs; and (III) derive an innovative machine learning model to identify highly heritable neurobiological subtypes of SUDs that facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of addiction. We will focus on alcohol and nicotine use disorders to demonstrate the conceptual and methodological approaches. We believe that, by providing a productive conceptual and methodological platform to integrate imaging and genetic data to understand the etiologies of SUDs, this research is highly responsive to the RFA “Leveraging Big Data Science to Elucidate the Neural Mechanisms of Addiction and SUD.” The machine learning tools developed for this project will provide an innovative and reliable foundation to enhance the aggregation and analysis of multidimensional data, and to meet the diagnostic and predictive challenges in mental health research.

"Modified Use of E-cigarettes and Marketing on YouTube PROJECT SUMMARY E-cigarette use among U.S. youth is a significant public health problem. Understanding youth appeal of e- cigarettes and marketing strategies targeting youth is critical to inform the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s goal to prevent youth e-cigarette use. A significant youth appeal is the ability to modify e-cigarettes or to “hack” the devices or e-liquid constituents for unintended purposes (e.g., using at higher temperatures or for a longer period of time, adding their own e-liquids made with nicotine or THC oil). However, it is largely unknown how youth modify e-cigarette devices or their components, their perceptions of these behaviors, and marketing strategies used to endorse these behaviors. YouTube, a popular social media, can be examined to understand modified uses of e-cigarettes and marketing associated with these behaviors. The overall goal of this study is to understand ways in which youth modify e-cigarettes, their motivations for doing so, and marketing sources, using YouTube analysis, survey methodology, and expert evaluation. We will identify modified uses of e-cigarettes and marketing using fictitious youth YouTube viewer profiles to search for e-cigarettes using a browser plug-in and custom scripted web-crawling and then machine learning to automatically code the videos to identify e-cigarette modifications and marketing source. Our Advisory Committee (AC) of subject matter experts in tobacco regulatory science, social media, youth tobacco use, toxicology, communications, and tobacco marketing will apply their knowledge to assess the potential impact of these identified modified uses on appeal, addiction, and health effects of e-cigarettes to identify those which are amenable to FDA regulations and communications. We will then conduct an in-depth analysis of these selected behaviors using a combination of machine learning and detailed human coding on youth-accessible YouTube videos to understand: 1) components that are modified (e.g., batteries, cartridges/pods, e-liquids), 2) motivations for modification (e.g., enhance user experience, reduce perceived harm), 3) marketing sources (e.g., online shops, pro-e-cigarette organizations), and 4) appeal (number of likes, views). We will also use an online survey with adolescent and young adult e-cigarette users (N=1000) to examine the prevalence, appeal, motivations, risk perceptions, and marketing exposure related to these modified uses and their predictors (i.e., demographic variables, past-month e-cigarette use frequency, e-cigarette dependence, other tobacco/substance use, interpersonal and intrapersonal risk factors). The results of this study will provide the FDA with novel evidence to 1) develop regulations to prohibit the manufacturing and marketing of e-cigarette components that can be modified by youth, 2) restrict youth-accessible marketing of e-cigarettes on social media such as YouTube, and 3) develop prevention campaigns to educate youth about the harms of modifying e-cigarettes. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: E-cigarette use among youth is high; thus, to inform youth e-cigarette prevention, we will examine the youth appeal of the product, such as the ability to modify or “hack” the devices and their related components for unintended uses and marketing on popular social media, YouTube. We will use mixed-methods (i.e., machine learning, survey methodology, expert evaluation) to achieve our aim. The results of this study will provide the FDA with novel evidence to develop regulations to prohibit the manufacturing and marketing of e-cigarette components that can be modified, restrict youth-accessible marketing of e-cigarettes on YouTube, and develop prevention campaigns to educate youth about the harms of engaging in these behaviors.",Modified Use of E-cigarettes and Marketing on YouTube,9981285,R01DA049878,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Behavior', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Devices', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Esthesia', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High temperature of physical object', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Industry', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Motivation', 'Nicotine', 'Oils', 'Perception', 'Plug-in', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Toxicology', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'demographics', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic liquid', 'experience', 'male', 'marijuana vaping', 'novel', 'preference', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk perception', 'sex', 'social', 'social media', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco regulatory science', 'vaping', 'web site']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,453703,-0.10283707868634026
"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments.

"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,9821740,R01MH112829,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diffusion', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Telemedicine', 'Telemental', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care costs', 'contextual factors', 'control trial', 'demographics', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'experience', 'geographic difference', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'older patient', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'rapid growth', 'rural area', 'severe mental illness', 'statistical and machine learning', 'symposium', 'trend', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,709065,0.03295520804776183
"Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses and Predicting Medication-Class Response in Patients Project Summary/Abstract  Mood disorders, like many psychiatric conditions, have their onset in emerging adulthood and often last a lifetime. Mental illnesses have an excessively large loading of Disability Adjusted Life Years, making early intervention crucial for both individuals and society. Differentiating bipolar disorder (BD) from major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) can be especially challenging if clear mania is absent. In fact, BD patients go an average of 6-10 years without the proper diagnosis, with 70% misdiagnosed with MDD instead. The challenge of identifying BD patients among depressed individuals is complex but critical because diagnosis determines treatment. The use of antidepressant (AD) medications in patients with BD can lead to worsening of illness. We have recently shown that, using resting fMRI, we can predict future medication class response with high accuracy (> 90%). In this project we will build on this work to generalize to a new MRI scanner and clinical assessment protocol. In addition we will develop, in consultation with multiple psychiatrists, a cloud-based tool to analyze and report the results from the brain imaging protocol and machine learning analysis, in a timely, meaningful, and interpretable manner. Results are expected to be an important step forward in the eventual development of clinical useful markers of mental illness. 2 Project Narrative  Patients with mood disorders will often spend months to years on the wrong medication, which can also make them worse (e.g., putting individuals with bipolar disorder on antidepressants). There is a great need to develop biomarkers of treatment response in mental illness. This work will build on recent work from our group showing over 90% accuracy using resting fMRI predictors to further generalize the results to multiple scanners and develop an online portal to process and provide reporting of results (classification results) as well as processed data and citation information.",Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses and Predicting Medication-Class Response in Patients,10157747,R41MH122201,"['Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Combination Medication', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Financial cost', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'New Mexico', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Ontario', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatrist', 'Readiness', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data sharing', 'data tools', 'data warehouse', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adulthood', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'quality assurance', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'web portal']",NIMH,ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS GROUP,R41,2020,437555,0.010180649178307266
"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,9709107,R01HD092331,"['Academia', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Crime', 'Criminology', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Family', 'Firearms', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Security', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'behavioral outcome', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'convict', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'developmental psychology', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'repeat offender', 'social', 'social factors', 'structured data', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2020,706182,0.0048387399277281355
"Personalized Networks and Sensor Technology Algorithms of Eating Disorder Symptoms Predicting Eating Disorder Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are severe mental illnesses with the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. The most widely used empirically supported treatment for EDs (cognitive behavior therapy) is only efficacious for ~50% of individuals. This low response rate is due to the fact that EDs are heterogeneous conditions with diverse symptom trajectories that are not adequately addressed in current “one-size-fits-all” psychotherapies. Until we can identify what maintains or exacerbates individual symptoms, clinicians will continue to have difficulty accurately predicting prognosis and will have no empirical guidance to develop targeted treatment plans to promote recovery. Our scientific premise, developed from our past work, is that the application of network theory will enable the identification of cognitive-behavioral symptom networks that maintain and ‘trigger’ EDs both between and within individuals. Our study goals are to (1) identify individual ED ‘trigger’ symptoms (cognitions, behaviors, affect, and physiology) and (2) correlate trigger symptoms with real-time physiological data to create an algorithm predicting onset of ED behaviors. These goals will ultimately identify symptoms that prevent full remission and lead to relapse. We will use a multiple units of analysis approach combined with novel, cutting-edge advances in network science. We will collect intensive real- time data on cognitions, behavior, affect, and physiology using mobile and sensor-technology from 120 individuals with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN), atypical AN, and bulimia nervosa across 30 days. At 1-month and 6-month follow ups we will assess ED outcomes (e.g., remission status, ED behaviors) to test if ‘trigger’ symptoms predict ED outcomes. Network science and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques will allow us, for the first time, to discover whether certain trigger symptoms predict worse outcomes. Specific aims are to (1) develop personalized networks to identify which cognitive, behavioral, affective, and physiological symptoms maintain EDs and predict ED outcomes and (2) utilize sensor data to identify physiological patterns both within and across people that correlate with core maintaining symptoms and that predict ED behaviors. The proposed research uses highly innovative methods, combining intensive longitudinal data collection methods, all remote procedures, novel advances in network science and sensor-technology, and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to answer previously unresolvable questions pinpointing which personalized symptoms trigger EDs. The proposed research has clinical impact. If we identify patterns that contribute to symptom network variation within individuals, these data will provide a model of personalized medicine for the entire field of psychiatry, as well as providing novel intervention targets to prevent and treat EDs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will identify the maintaining symptoms of eating disorders within individuals. The proposed research has significant public health relevance, as it will lead to personalized, novel, effective treatments that promote full remission and decrease the high societal burden associated with eating disorders. The proposed research is relevant to NIH’s precision medicine initiative, as it will identify within-person, maintenance symptoms of eating disorders, leading to personalized treatments delivered via mobile or sensor technology.",Personalized Networks and Sensor Technology Algorithms of Eating Disorder Symptoms Predicting Eating Disorder Outcomes,10044077,R15MH121445,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Binge Eating', 'Bulimia', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Eating Disorders', 'Epilepsy', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Science', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'food restriction', 'innovation', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'severe mental illness', 'smartphone Application', 'standard care', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'treatment planning', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R15,2020,463165,0.007118480038143103
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis Dr. Hwanhee Hong is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development. Dr. Hong will also use all available resources from other Departments including biostatistics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. This environment maximizes the potential for Dr. Hong to obtain the necessary training and perform the research to establish herself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program. This project will help mental health researchers generalize, apply, and implement findings from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials to target populations. Traditional meta-analyses enable us to borrow strength across multiple studies to gain more power, resulting in reliable and precise effect estimates; however they do not consider how well the trials represent target populations of interest. By developing methods to help generalize the results of meta-analyses, we will help translate results into appropriate decisions regarding broad implementation and clinical practice.",Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis,9935960,R00MH111807,"['Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data access', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'informal learning', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open data', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'randomized controlled design', 'randomized trial', 'regression trees', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'working group']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,248999,0.003792713739766607
"CBTpro: Scaling up CBT for psychosis using simulated patients and spoken language technologies Psychosis resulting from schizophrenia spectrum disorders and major mood disorders is one of the most disabling health concerns worldwide. Evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended as standard of care by national psychosis treatment guidelines but are rarely accessible. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is the most well-researched psychotherapy for psychotic disorders, yet fewer than 1% of American mental health providers are trained in this intervention. To date, there has been no scalable way to offer high-quality and sustainable CBTp training to mental health providers. The primary objective of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) proposal is to develop and evaluate a spoken language technology tool – CBTpro -- to support high-quality skills training in CBTp. CBTpro will provide a rapid means of scaling and sustaining CBTp in routine care settings across the US, resulting in more clinicians across the country providing higher quality CBTp to individuals with psychosis. This fast-track STTR proposal has two phases. The objective of Phase I is to develop a CBTpro prototype, which requires three core activities: Aim 1: understand community stakeholder needs to inform software design and functionality; Aim 2: develop CBTpro digital content; and Aim 3: train and validate machine learning algorithms to automatically score CBTp fidelity. The objective of Phase II is to optimize and test the CBTpro tool in real world practice settings. Accordingly, in Phase II, we will Aim 1: conduct a lab usability study (Aim 1a) followed by field testing of the CBTpro prototype (Aim 1b) with 20 trainees; Aim 2: conduct a randomized controlled trial of CBTpro training vs. training as usual (N= 100 providers / N=300 clients), using a nested mixed model analysis to determine the effect of CBTpro on client symptoms, functioning, and recovery; and Aim 3: adopting an NIMH experimental therapeutics approach, assess the hypothesized mechanism by which CBTpro affects clinical outcomes through increased provider fidelity to CBTp (mediation), and test whether the strength of the relationship between these variables is affected by client skill acquisition (moderation). This proposal directly addresses the National Institute of Mental Health’s strategic objectives to improve dissemination, implementation, and continuous improvement of evidence-based mental health services (Objective 4.2) and develop innovative models to dramatically improve the outcomes of mental health services received (Objective 4.3), particularly through the use of novel technology. CBTpro has the potential to reduce the high personal and societal costs associated with serious mental illness, redress the challenges of training amidst high rates of mental health system turnover, support supervisors in quality assurance and improvement efforts, and reduce health disparities associated with mental health workforce shortage areas. Evidence based psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended by national psychosis treatment guidelines, but are inaccessible in routine practice. The objective of this proposal is to systematically develop, pilot, and rigorously test CBTpro, a novel clinician support tool designed to train community mental health workers to provide cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis skills to their clients. CBTpro merges cutting- edge technology with best psychotherapeutic practices for serious mental illness to enable a rapid research, development, and testing pipeline.",CBTpro: Scaling up CBT for psychosis using simulated patients and spoken language technologies,10004543,R42MH123215,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Provider', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Design', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Workforce Development', 'arm', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'cognitive benefits', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'field study', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'practice setting', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'quality assurance', 'rehearsal', 'repository', 'research and development', 'response', 'routine care', 'routine practice', 'scale up', 'severe mental illness', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'societal costs', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines', 'usability', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIMH,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R42,2020,498562,-0.018084883238652063
"Innovative biostatistical approaches to network level analyses of connectome-behavior relationships PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Determining the mechanisms by which the human brain generates cognition, perception, and emotion hinges upon quantifying the relationships between coordinated brain activity and behavior. NIH-funded brain mapping initiatives such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Adolescent Cognitive and Behavioral Development (ABCD) study, have accelerated the production of large brain connectivity (i.e. connectome) and behavioral datasets. Contemporary connectome research views the brain as a large-scale, complex network composed of nonadjacent, yet connected brain regions. We propose to leverage the inherent network architecture of the connectome in order to probe fundamental biological mechanisms underlying the development of executive function and internalizing symptoms. In pursuit of this research question, this application proposes to formalize and validate in house analysis pipelines into a Network Level Analysis (NLA) toolbox as a comprehensive, versatile tool for use in connectome-wide association studies. The proposed NLA toolbox fulfills BRAIN Initiative goal #5 to “Produce conceptual foundations for understanding the biological basis of mental processes through development of new theoretical and data analysis tools”. While the research focus of this career transition award is on the application of NLA to developmental mechanisms of executive function and emotion regulation, this versatile analytic tool will be transformative to connectome data analysis across species, across the lifespan, and in health and disease. As part of tool development, the applicant will validate multiple NLA approaches using in silico connectome-behavior relationships and establish sensitivity and specificity of network level findings as compared to the connectome-wide control of familywise error rate (K99 Aim 1). The applicant will then establish test-retest reliability of NLA approaches using in vivo human connectome and behavioral data available from the HCP-Young Adult cohort (N=1105), and establish brain networks underlying healthy adult executive and emotional function (K99 Aim 2). During the independent R00 phase, she will then investigate changes in connectome architecture supporting the development of executive and emotional function using the ABCD longitudinal connectome and behavioral data (N=~11,000 age 9-14) (R00 Aim 3). During the K99 phase she will extend her training in behavioral neuroscience to include training in machine learning, longitudinal models, and computer science. Building on her strong foundation in human brain connectivity analysis, the applicant will gain advanced skills in biostatistics and best practices in software development to ensure her success as an independent researcher. The advisory committee, including Drs. Smyser (functional connectivity), Marcus (software engineering), Fair (developmental neuroscience), Todorov (biostatistics), Zhang (machine learning), Bassett (connectome analysis), Eggebrecht (toolbox development), and Barch (HCP/ABCD consultant) provide expertise in all core areas spanning experimental disciplines and possess an excellent record of obtaining independent funding and mentoring young scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE While significant research efforts have been devoted to determining the biological pathways of cognition and emotion, there is concern over the lack of reproducibility of findings. This proposal seeks to develop and apply a Network Level Analysis (NLA) toolbox which will be used to identify and characterize the brain networks underlying healthy and disordered development of executive and emotional processes. The NLA toolbox is a versatile analysis pipeline which leverages the structural and functional architecture of the brain and rigorous statistical testing and validation procedures to define brain-behavior relationships across species, across the lifespan, and in health and disease.",Innovative biostatistical approaches to network level analyses of connectome-behavior relationships,10055480,K99EB029343,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Endocrine', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Processes', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'cloud based', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'dimensional analysis', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional functioning', 'executive function', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'longitudinal design', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'skills', 'skills training', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development', 'young adult']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,126289,-0.011945803166727845
"Testing Scalable, Single-Session Interventions for Adolescent Depression in the context of COVID-19 Project Summary/Abstract States and localities nationwide are taking unprecedented steps to reduce public health threats posed by COVID-19, including school closures affecting >50 million youth. The pandemic has also caused families extreme financial hardship, sudden unemployment, and distress. This combination of collective trauma, social isolation, and economic recession drastically increases risk for adolescent major depression (MD): already the lead cause of disability in youth. However, youth MD treatments face problems of potency and accessibility. Up to 65% of youth receiving MD treatment fail to respond, partly due to MD’s heterogeneity: an MD diagnosis reflects >1400 possible symptom combinations, highlighting the need for treatments matched to personal need. Treatment accessibility issues are similarly severe. Before the pandemic, <50% of youth with MD accessed any treatment at all; newfound financial strain will further preclude families’ capacity to afford care for their children. It is thus critical to identify effective, scalable strategies to buffer against youth MD in the context of COVID-19, along with strategies to match such interventions with youth most likely to benefit. This project will integrate machine learning approaches and large-scale SSI research to rapidly test potent, accessible strategies for reducing adolescent MD during COVID-19. Via the largest-ever SSI trial (N=1,200 youth with elevated MD symptoms, ages 12-16), Aim 1 is to test whether (1) evidence-based SSIs improve proximal targets (e.g., hopelessness and perceived agency, which has predicted longer-term SSI response) and 3- month clinical outcomes (MD severity) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) whether SSIs targeting cognitive versus behavioral MD symptoms are most impactful in this context. In a fully-online trial, youths recruited from across the U.S. will be randomized to 1 of 3 self-administered SSIs: a behavioral activation SSI, targeting behavioral MD symptoms (anhedonia; activity withdrawal); an SSI teaching growth mindset, the belief that personal traits are malleable, targeting cognitive MD symptoms (e.g. hopelessness); or a control SSI. Per baseline, post-SSI, and 3-month follow-up data, we will test each SSI’s relative benefits, versus the control, in the context of COVID-19. Results will reveal whether SSIs targeting behavioral versus cognitive symptoms differentially reduce overall MD severity in this context. Aim 2 is to test whether (and, if so, which of) SSIs can impact COVID-19 specific trauma and anxiety symptoms, informing whether novel, COVID-19-tailored supports may be needed to reduce pandemic-specific mental health sequelae. Aim 3 is to test person-level and contextual predictors of SSI response, via machine-learning techniques, regardless of overall intervention effects observed. Given MD’s heterogeneity, we will test whether baseline symptoms (e.g., having more severe cognitive or behavioral MD symptoms) predict response to SSIs targeting different symptom types. We will also test exposure to COVID-19-related adversities (e.g. parent job loss; loved one hospitalized for COVID-19) and general disadvantage (e.g. family low-income; racial minority status) forecast SSI response. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to integrate machine learning approaches and large-scale single-session intervention (SSI) research to rapidly test potent, accessible strategies for reducing depression in adolescents in the context of COVID-19. Via the largest-ever SSI trial (N=1200 adolescents), goals are to test whether evidence- based SSIs improve proximal targets (hopelessness, perceived agency, anhedonia) and clinical outcomes 3 months later (depression symptoms and COVID-19-related anxiety and trauma) in adolescents experiencing depression; whether SSIs targeting cognitive versus behavioral depression symptoms produce more favorable outcomes, versus an active control; and whether individual profiles of symptoms or COVID-19-related adversity exposure predicts individual-level SSI response. Results may identify novel, immediately actionable strategies to matching adolescents to targeted SSIs based on personal needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Testing Scalable, Single-Session Interventions for Adolescent Depression in the context of COVID-19",10164526,DP5OD028123,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Buffers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Distress', 'Dropout', 'Economic Recession', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Financial Hardship', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Self Administration', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Unemployment', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'Youth', 'active control', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'child depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'loved ones', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'predicting response', 'premature', 'psychosocial', 'racial minority', 'recruit', 'response', 'social media', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'trauma symptom', 'treatment trial', 'virtual']",OD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,DP5,2020,392813,0.029773892120804262
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years.

"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9917845,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Appalachia', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'social structure', 'sociodemographics', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2020,371411,-0.02868591116949783
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,9812223,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,687420,0.024296254315233325
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years. This work will advance translational science in SUD research and markedly reduce the gap between SUD research and clinical practice -- with a focus on scaling-up and sustaining best practices.",Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,10161464,UG1DA040309,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Community Networks', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Drug abuse', 'Experimental Designs', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Fire - disasters', 'Funding', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Maine', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'National Clinical Trials Network', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New Hampshire', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Science', 'Security', 'Series', 'Strategic Planning', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vermont', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'chronic pain', 'clinical practice', 'cocaine use', 'college', 'community organizations', 'comorbidity', 'data privacy', 'design', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care settings', 'health data', 'high risk population', 'high school', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'marijuana use', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'personalized health care', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'randomized trial', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'research study', 'rural setting', 'scale up', 'screening', 'smart watch', 'social media', 'special interest group', 'telehealth', 'treatment disparity', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,UG1,2020,622500,-0.025033721558462223
"Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rather than a dichotomy between health and pathology, many mental illnesses—especially depression and other mood disorders—are best conceptualized as the far end of a phenotypic spectrum, suggesting that characterizing individual differences in brain function and behavior will help further our understanding of disease. Existing work suggests that fMRI has the potential to predict individual behaviors from brain function, yet progress has been hindered by an overreliance on group studies (i.e., patients versus controls) and limited paradigms (i.e., either highly controlled tasks that risk being artificial, or at the other extreme, resting state, which is entirely unconstrained and difficult to interpret). Naturalistic fMRI, in which subjects do complex, engaging tasks such as watching films or listening to stories, offers an alternative that more closely mimics real-world cognition and may allow researchers to extract richer, more meaningful information from a single individual’s scan. As such, these paradigms are promising candidates for brain “stress tests” that would elicit patterns of brain activity that predict present or future behaviors. The specific aims of this project are: (1) to leverage existing large-scale datasets to develop methods to predict phenotypes from naturalistic fMRI data; (2) to design and conduct an fMRI study using targeted film stimuli to draw out individual variability of interest, specifically in traits related to depression; and (3) to extend the newly developed paradigms and analyses to a longitudinal study of a population at risk for depression and/or other mood disorders. Several innovative approaches to data analysis will be investigated. The central hypothesis is that brain activity evoked by these paradigms will vary across individuals in a continuous, multidimensional space that covaries with phenotype strength, that these relationships will be strong enough to predict phenotypes in unseen individuals, and that modified (e.g., attenuated) versions of patterns associated with illness will be detectable via these paradigms in those at risk before the emergence of symptoms. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded faculty member at a research-intensive university, with a research program exploring the basic cognitive neuroscience of individual differences in personality and cognition, as well as developing translational applications for psychiatry. To reach this goal, the training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s skills in the following areas: (1) applying machine learning techniques to predict individual-subject behavior from fMRI data; (2) conducting neuroimaging and behavioral research on depression and mood disorders with clinical and at-risk populations; and (3) gaining professional skills essential for a successful independent research career. The environment in which the career development will take place is the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, a vibrant community with outstanding resources to support the proposed project, including relevant courses and seminars, state-of-the-art facilities for MRI data acquisition and analysis, computing power, and expertise and guidance from senior scientists in neuroscience, engineering, machine learning and psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mental illness—especially depression and other mood disorders—is a massive burden on individuals, families and societies, yet psychiatrists lack brain-based biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. This project seeks to fill that gap by conceptualizing mood disorders as the extreme end of a continuous phenotypic spectrum in the human population, and using functional brain imaging to study how individuals differ in their neural and behavioral responses to naturalistic, emotionally evocative stimuli. This project will deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of individual variability related to mood disorders, and has the potential to lead to a “stress test” for psychiatry that would help identify at-risk individuals for earlier intervention.",Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum,10156737,R00MH120257,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Cognition', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Film', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Processes', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Normalcy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Property', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Senior Scientist', 'Social Environment', 'Societies', 'Stimulus', 'Stress Tests', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'emotional stimulus', 'healthy volunteer', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'member', 'mood symptom', 'movie', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R00,2020,249000,0.01230980614749204
"Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use Project Summary/Abstract  Insufficient knowledge of brain-based risk factors for problem cannabis use is a key barrier to identifying individuals at risk for cannabis-related harm and designing targeted prevention and early intervention approaches to promote positive development for persons at risk. The current proposal combines multiple, large- scale, neuroimaging datasets with novel densely-sampled fMRI data to identify a neuromarker of problem cannabis use and characterize its development prior to cannabis use onset, and in the context of current cannabis use in adolescence. We will apply a whole-brain, machine-learning method – connectome-based predictive modeling – to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use in a large sample of college students (Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students study; BARCS), and compare this network to canonical neural networks previously implicated in risk for cannabis use: frontoparietal, salience, and default mode networks. We will then examine the developmental trajectory of these cannabis risk networks in relation to other known risk factors for addiction prior to cannabis use onset in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, a nationally-representative sample of 11,875 children. We will examine whether individuals at high-risk for substance use problems (family history of substance use and exposure to early adversity) display a delay in the typical trajectory of network stabilization within cannabis risk networks. Finally, we will collect densely-sampled fMRI data (4 scans in 6 months) from 20 adolescents (age 15-17) who regularly use cannabis and 20 age- and sex-matched typically-developing adolescents. This study design will enable us to examine cannabis effects on short-term neural network dynamics and evaluate whether cannabis using adolescents are characterized by reduced stability of cannabis risk networks relative to their typically-developing peers. By combining multiple existing large-scale neuroimaging datasets with original, longitudinal, densely- sampled fMRI data, the proposed study design offers a unique opportunity to examine the interplay between neural mechanisms of risk for problem use and cannabis exposure effects on the developing adolescent brain and promises to yield important insights into the neural mechanisms of risk for problem cannabis use that can foster novel prevention and intervention initiatives to mitigate cannabis-related harms for individuals at high risk.  The current proposal also aims to provide Dr. Sarah Lichenstein with expert mentorship by Drs. Pearlson, Casey, Yip, Scheinost and Stevens to build the skills necessary to develop into an independent clinical scientist applying multimodal neuroimaging methods to study the pathophysiology of addiction. Dr. Lichenstein will pursue specialized training in studying cannabis effects on brain and behavior, big data science, and the conduct of research with adolescent participants. Furthermore, the collection of novel, densely-sampled, adolescent fMRI data will also provide Dr. Lichenstein with a rich and unique pilot dataset to support the submission of a R01 application by the end of the award period and facilitate her transition to an independent investigator. Project Narrative Cannabis use is extremely common and associated with clinically-significant negative outcomes for a subset of users, yet it is not currently possible to predict who is at highest risk for cannabis-related harms at the individual level. The current proposal aims to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use, and to characterize the development of this network both before and after cannabis use onset. Elucidating the neural basis of problem cannabis use will facilitate the development of novel prevention and early intervention efforts to mitigate potential cannabis-related harms for individuals at highest risk.",Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use,10038977,K08DA051667,"['18 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Cannabis', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Fostering', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol research', 'base', 'big-data science', 'brain behavior', 'brain research', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'design', 'early life adversity', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'peer', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'skills', 'university student']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,191700,-0.0048950213620200115
"Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence Youth violence victimization is common and increases risk for a host of negative health outcomes, most notably posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is the strongest predictor of poor quality of life following trauma, even among those injured during the event. Given the potential harmful sequelae of trauma exposure, it is crucial to identify acute post-victimization risk factors that predict chronic PTSD. At this juncture relatively little data exists to aid in prediction of youth at risk for poor long-term adjustment following victimization or other types of trauma, and there are no studies measuring relevant neural systems. Thus, our team aims to 1) characterize acute post-victimization neurobehavioral predictors of risk for chronic PTSD with a focus on prefrontal-subcortical function during processing of threat processing and frontoparietal networks for cognitive control, and 2) use machine learning to identify the most robust set of predictors of chronic PTSD drawn from a comprehensive assessment of youth neuroimaging, behavior and self-report, parent and family factors, and neighborhood and community variables. Our team is well-prepared to successfully achieve these aims, as we have relevant expertise in conducting prospective longitudinal assessment of acute neurobehavioral predictors of risk for PTSD in adults (Larson), conducting longitudinal assessment of youth victims of violence (Levas), and longitudinally characterizing neurobehavioral profiles of youth PTSD (Herringa). We will recruit youth victims of violence aged 10-16 from the Emergency Department at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and conduct comprehensive assessments at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months following victimization. To achieve a final sample of 200 youth at 12 month follow-up, we will recruit 240 youth, oversampled for risk for PTSD based on currently available brief self-report indicators. Each assessment will include measures of neural systems instantiating threat processing, including both reactivity to threat and anticipation of unpredictable and predictable threat, and cognitive control, along with measures of PTSD and other symptoms, cognitive functioning, family environment, social and school functioning, and socioenvironmental factors (e.g. neighborhood disadvantage, discrimination). We will examine how acute post- victimization variables (2 week) and early change following victimization (from 2 weeks to 3 months) predict PTSD and other outcomes twelve months later. We will use both hypothesis-driven analyses focusing on a priori specified regions and predictors, as well as comprehensive data-driven machine learning analyses. The comprehensive assessment will allow for determination of the additional utility of neural markers for predicting risk beyond previously identified self-report indicators. We expect this project to lead to identification of predictors of risk for PTSD following victimization that are linked to underlying processes (hyper-responsivity to threat, aberrant cognitive control) that can directly inform preventive interventions, ultimately improving the quality of life for youth victims of violence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying youth victims of violence most at risk for long-term post-traumatic distress is a pressing public health problem. This work seeks to identify dysregulation in neural circuitry supporting cognitive and affective processes two weeks after victimization predicts PTSD and other post-trauma symptom twelve months later. These data will advance our understanding of neurobiological factors associated with vulnerability to specific trauma-related pathology and provide an important step toward identifying appropriate early interventions in the wake of violence victimization.",Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence,9941466,R01MH124076,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Early-life trauma', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Victimization', 'Violence', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'brain health', 'child and adolescent victimization', 'clinical care', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'physical assault', 'post-trauma', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'sexual assault', 'social', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic stress', 'violence exposure', 'violence victimization', 'youth violence']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2020,768281,0.01896178956725546
"Title: Neurobiology of seizure generalization during electroconvulsive therapy for major depression PROJECT SUMMARY Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for severe depression and other mental health conditions, yet how ECT changes the brain to ameliorate the symptoms of depression is not well understood. Seizure generalization appears to be critical for successful antidepressant response to ECT, and stimulation dose is adjusted to ensure an “adequate” seizure. Previous studies have linked seizure generalization during ECT with thalamocortical regions, and our own MRI studies indicate that thalamocortical networks exhibit neuroplasticity after treatment in patients who respond to ECT. Yet, despite recent growth in the number of MRI studies measuring long-term neuroplasticity across ECT sessions, relatively less is known about the neurobiology of seizure activity elicited during each session. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to understand how ECT-induced seizures change brain networks to treat depression. To address this goal, we will take a data-driven, machine learning approach to pre-existing ECT-MRI datasets of patients with depression, to identify the neurobiological features measured with MRI (functional connectivity, gray-matter morphometry, electric fields) that optimally explain inter-patient variability in seizure indicators (seizure duration and stimulation dose). Aim 1 will identify biomarkers of susceptibility to ECT-induced seizures by analyzing pre-treatment MRI with respect to initial stimulation dose and seizure duration. Aim 2 studies will determine how brain network plasticity over the course of ECT relates to changes in stimulation dose and duration of ECT-induced seizures. These studies will further our understanding of therapeutic seizures in ECT, potentially facilitating prediction of optimal dose and/or treatment outcome to improve ECT and minimize side effects. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for severe depression and other mental health conditions, yet how ECT changes the brain to ameliorate the symptoms of depression is not well understood.

"Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding Project Summary Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the factors that promote disease risk and resilience may be distinct in men and women. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this possibility are poorly understood, however, because the vast majority of pre- clinical animal research has been conducted in males. In addition, the behavioral outcome measures used to understand learned fear have focused predominantly on passive, or freezing behavior. We recently identified an active, escape-like conditioned fear response in rats (“darting”) that occurred almost exclusively in females and was predictive of improved extinction retention. A better understanding of potentially sexually dimorphic mechanisms that drive this behavior could open new avenues for treatment of disorders that are more prevalent in women, like PTSD. We propose here to define the neural circuitry that drives the selection of conditioned darting vs. freezing, and how that integrates with known extinction circuits to promote extinction retention. Our preliminary data implicate the infralimbic cortex (IL) in this role, and we will use pharmacological, chemogenetic, and viral techniques to probe how descending IL projections to the dorsal and ventral periaqueductal gray (PAG) may mediate a strategic switch between active and passive responding and drive long-term behavioral flexibility through putative collaterals in the amygdala. We will then use sophisticated machine vision and machine learning-based tools to define the broader behavioral repertoires within which darting exists, thereby identifying a multifaceted phenotype that could provide insight into the mechanisms underlying individual differences in stress resilience and vulnerability. Project Narrative Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the risk factors that promote disease susceptibility may be distinct in men and women. This project explores the neurobiological basis of divergent (active vs. passive) fear responses in males and females, which could help identify novel ways to prevent or treat post-traumatic stress disorder.",Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding,10033671,R01MH123803,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Crete', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dorsal', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'FOS gene', 'Female', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Rattus', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sex Differences', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'coping', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine vision', 'male', 'men', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'selective expression', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'stress resilience', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,503268,-0.022110262500641548
"A Data Science Framework for Empirically Evaluating and Deriving Reproducible and Transferrable RDoC Constructs in Youth This project provides a data science framework and a toolbox of best practices for systematic and reproducible data-driven methods for validating and deriving RDoC constructs with relevance to psychopathology. Despite recent advances in methods for data-driven constructs, results are often hard to reproduce using samples from other studies. There is a lack of systematic statistical methods and analytical design for enhancing reproducibility. To fill this gap, we will develop a data science framework, including novel scalable algorithms and software, to derive and validate RDoC constructs. Although the proposed methods will generally apply to all RDoC domains and constructs, we focus specifically on furthering understanding of the RDoC domains of cognitive control (CC) and attention (ATT) constructs implicated in attention deficit disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Our application will use multi-modal neuroimaging, behavioral, and clinical/self-report data from large, nationally representative samples from the on Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and multiple local clinical samples with ADHD and OCD. Specifically, using the baseline ABCD samples, in aim 1, we will apply and develop methods to assess and validate the current configuration of RDoC for CC and ATT using confirmatory latent variable modeling. We will implement and develop new unsupervised learning methods to construct new computational-driven, brain-based domains from multi-modal image data. In Aim 2, We will introduce network analysis (via Gaussian graphical models) to characterize heterogeneity in the interrelationship of RDoC measurements due to observed characteristics (i.e., age and sex). We will further model the heterogeneity of the population due to unobserved characteristics by introducing the data-driven precision phenotypes, which are the subgroup of participants with similar RDoC dimensions. We propose a Hierarchical Bayesian Generative Model and scalable algorithm for simultaneous dimension reduction and identify precision phenotypes. The model also serves as a tool to transfer information from the community sample ABCD to local clinical enriched studies. In aim 3, we will utilize the follow-up samples from ABCD and local clinical enriched data sets to validate the results from Aims 1 and 2 and assess the clinical utility of the precision phenotypes in predicting psychological development in follow-up time. Our project will provide a suite of analytical tools to validate existing RDoC constructs and derive new, reproducible constructs by accounting for various sources of heterogeneity. To advance the understanding of psychopathology using dimensional constructs of measurements from multiple units of analysis, we propose reproducible statistical framework for validating and deriving RDoC constructs with relevance to psychopathology. We will use multi-modal neuroimaging, behavioral and clinical/self-report data from multiple samples to develop this framework. The design of our study consists of analyzing large, nationally representative samples, validating the results in local clinically enriched samples, and transfer information from the large community samples to local clinical samples.",A Data Science Framework for Empirically Evaluating and Deriving Reproducible and Transferrable RDoC Constructs in Youth,10058921,R01MH124106,"['11 year old', 'Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychopathology', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'analytical tool', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'biological sex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,710101,-0.006434188523138938
"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief.

"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality. Rates of depression begin to rise rapidly in early-mid adolescence and peak in early adulthood. This project seeks to identify early antecedents and risk factors for the onset of depressive disorders and to understand the processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically signficant psychopathology.

"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9993927,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,454017,0.0037277197102879543
"Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes Project Summary Motor vehicle crashes lead causes of adolescent mortality, making this a major health threat facing US adolescents. Given that 95.6% of novice driver crashes are due to driver error, improved skill should reduce crash incidence. Research supports this: novice driver crash rates peak immediately following licensure and decline steeply with experience gained over the months following licensure. However, it is not known which critical driving skill deficits present at licensure predict crashes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop interventions prior to licensure that can lead to the safest independent driving post licensure. With this R21 project, we will identify deficits in driving skills that are (a) associated with major predictors of early crash risk (age at licensure and sex) and that (b) can predict differences in crash rates within the first year of independent licensure. We will leverage our exclusive access to an innovative, newly available data source for young driver research. To enable study of safety critical driving skill deficits in novice drivers, results from a new (as of July 2017) virtual driving test (VDT) - developed by the PI, adopted by the State of Ohio and delivered immediately prior to the on-road licensing examination - will be linked to Ohio licensing and crash data. We propose these aims: Aim 1: identify skill clusters using multivariate clustering, regression and machine learning techniques to test the hypothesis that these clusters are related to age at licensure, sex, and time spent in the learner period; Aim 2a: use data on driving skills linked with reported crash data in Ohio to determine whether the skill clusters identified in Aim 1 are associated with crash risk; and Aim 2b: determine if those skill clusters from Aim1 are predictive of crashes in rural teen drivers. With a large sample of new driver applicants (>25,000), this study will examine, for the first time, differences in skill, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will create a normative dataset of novice driver skills; classify skill deficits by age, sex and time in learner period; and quantify the relationship between skill deficits and crash rates during the first 2 months of licensure (when crash rates are highest for young drivers) and the following 10 months as experience accumulates. If the use of the VDT proves successful in predicting crash risk, we will be able to identify novice drivers with elevated crash risk before granting a license. This R21 will enable the following lines of research: (1) Develop new interventions that address skill deficits through training, individualized to the needs of the novice driver (in partnership with Ohio). (2) Develop or adapt advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or self-driving vehicle technology to mitigate identified skill deficits (as part of Dr. Winston’s National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center). (3) Conduct a prospective study (R01) of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk. Narrative We will identify safety-critical driving skill deficits immediately prior to licensure that predict crashes, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will leverage exclusive access to newly available data on >25,000 novice drivers: state licensing and crash data linked to results from a new (as of July 2017), well-validated virtual driving test that identifies driving skill deficits (adopted by Ohio). If this R21 finds the VDT successful in predicting crash risk, we plan to: (1) conduct a future study of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk and (2) develop new interventions (training and vehicle technology) to address this risk.","Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes",10000116,R21HD099635,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industry', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Licensure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Police', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vehicle crash', 'Young driver', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'design', 'driving skills', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prospective', 'safety study', 'sex', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suburb', 'virtual']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,210334,-0.004424146023375198
"Care Improving Cognition for ADolescents on the Autism Spectrum (CICADAS) PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the current project is to elaborate upon, reconstruct and advance to pivotal trial readiness CICADAS (Care Improving Cognition for ADolescents on the Autism Spectrum)—a clinician-assisted, closed-loop technology, mobile application for adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Via ten mobile assessments CICADAS will capture data on sensory processing abnormalities and associated cognitive deficits. These data will populate a machine learning algorithm that will tailor the delivery of ten neuroplasticity-based social cognitive training (NB-SCT) exercises targeting sensory processing abnormalities. This individualized assessment and treatment approach is posited to induce adaptive long-term learning about social-emotional events, thus maximizing the impact and generalizability of psychological Evidence Based Treatments targeting social skills and relational strategies, including PEERS (Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relationship Skills). In particular, we posit that CICADAS-induced enhancement of processing and cognition will facilitate the application of PEERS skills in the environment of adolescents with ASD, thus improving their real- world functioning. In this project, we will build upon promising results obtained from two studies in anxiety and psychosis, leverage pilot data collected in adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and accumulate preliminary evidence for CICADAS to function as 1) a stand-alone treatment; 2) a primer for PEERS; 3) an enhancer for PEERS. In Specific Aim 1, we will finalize development, ensuring that assessment data correctly populate the closed- loop algorithm and correctly guide the delivery of individualized NB-SCT. Next, we will involve three adolescents with ASD and two PEERS clinicians in three focus groups that will be organized to refine CICADAS. Once decisions regarding app design are made, the three adolescents will be involved in a 2-week trial run to verify that CICADAS is detecting and improving sensory processing abnormalities and cognitive deficits. At the end of this test run, each stakeholder will be asked to rate enjoyment, ease of use, product quality, and perceived usefulness. Finally, we will submit these data from the trial run to our consultant to confirm that CICADAS is suitable for evaluation in the feasibility trial. In Specific Aim 2, we will conduct a three-arm randomized crossover trial with 48 adolescents with ASD to document the acceptability of CICADAS and evaluate its potential as a stand-alone treatment, as a primer for PEERS, or as a treatment enhancer of PEERS. At the completion of this project we will have usability data sufficient to support an efficacy trial in Phase II designed to establish medical claims. At the completion of Phase II, we will be able to complete the FDA regulatory pathway and have the opportunity to improve the lives of people suffering from this condition.

"ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE OF MALADAPTIVE SOCIOEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IN PRIMATES Specific Aims: Anxiety and depressive disorders are common, comorbid, and challenging to treat, ranking them among the greatest contributors to human suffering. An early-life extreme inhibited or anxious temperament, characterized by behavioral inhibition and extreme physiological responses to novel and/or potentially threatening contexts, is among the strongest predictors of the later development of anxiety and depressive disorders. Understanding the neurobiology of this early-life risk will identify treatment targets and provide a unique opportunity to develop scientifically founded behavioral and pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent stress-related psychopathology. Here, we propose a prospective longitudinal study in nonhuman primates (NHPs) to understand how inborn risk-factors and early-life inhibition lead to anxiety and maladaptive social behavior during adolescence and early adulthood. We will do this by leveraging the resources at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), including previous early-life assessments of behavioral inhibition, a multi-generational family pedigree, and large outdoor housing, alongside cutting-edge tools and analysis techniques, including multimodal neuroimaging and neural network-based animal tracking and behavioral analyses. We will use a prospective longitudinal design, and select 176 NHPs (88 F) previously phenotyped for early-life inhibition (3-4 months old) from the CNPRC’s large, multi-generational family pedigree. To study the emergence of anxiety- and depression-like symptomatology, half of the NHPs will be ""adolescents"" and half will be ""young adults"". We will perform in-lab behavioral and neuroimaging assessments, and longitudinal large-scale monitoring as animals navigate the entirety of their socio-geographic environment. First, we will examine how heritable-risk and early- life inhibition contribute to maladaptive socio-emotional behaviors in ecologically-valid contexts during adolescence and early adulthood (Aim 1). Starting in puberty, the risk for anxiety disorders is greater for girls than boys. Therefore, we also aim to demonstrate adolescent and young-adult sex differences in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 2). To understand how these factors are mediated by alterations in relevant brain circuitry, including the extended amygdala, each animal will undergo multimodal structural and functional neuroimaging assessments. Using these data, we will test specific hypotheses regarding the extent to which extended amygdala circuits link early-life inhibition to the progression of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 3). This combination of approaches promises to provide unprecedented insight into the neural substrates of maladaptive socio-emotional behavior during the transition to adulthood. PROJECT NARRATIVE A key challenge for psychiatry and clinical psychology is to discover, understand, and ultimately treat the root causes of the most common mental illness, including anxiety and depressive disorders. This project will harness an innovative combination of longitudinal measures and state-of-the-art tools—including a multi-generational pedigree, brain imaging, and deep neural networks—to objectively identify and prioritize the pathways that contribute to maladaptive social behavior as individuals mature into adults.

"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators).

"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9963415,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,0.005336159011965349

"Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support PROJECT SUMMARY Treatments for mental health conditions such as unipolar depression provide modest average benefit but have wide variation between individuals and within individuals over time. Evidence-based customized treatment protocols would improve the mental health care of many people by providing treatment recommendations for individuals that take into account potential variation because of personal characteristics such as current health status, symptoms, and response to earlier treatment. Generating customized treatment protocols requires large amounts of data, such as from networks of health systems that can link electronic health records from millions of individuals. Current statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols are limited in three important ways.  First, current approaches rely on scientists to select the patient characteristics to use to customize treatments instead of using data to find the patient characteristics that will lead to improved, customized care. Second, customized treatment protocols discovered with current statistical methods assume no unobserved differences between individuals who receive various treatment options. Third, investigators do not have ways to know if the available data contain enough information to discover and compare customized treatment protocols precisely enough to make clinical decisions. We will address these three limitations by developing new statistical tools for discovering customized treatment protocols using electronic health records data. Our research team has expertise and experience in statistics, epidemiology, and mental health care. We will integrate methods that have been successfully used in other settings to improve statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols and address these three important limitations.  We will extend machine learning tools for selecting important pieces of information to the time-varying data structure required for discovering customized treatment protocols. We will build approaches that use available knowledge about the size of unobserved differences between groups of people who received different treatments to assess how those differences change study results. By building on the math used to estimate the sample sizes needed for precision in randomized trials with complex designs, we will develop new formulas for determining how many people with a particular condition and who took a particular drug are needed in a health system to provide enough accurate information to discover customized treatment protocols.  Using data from the electronic health records of more than 15,000 patients, we will discover customized treatment protocols for depression. By improving statistical tools and addressing current limitations, our customized treatment protocols will have immediate impact for people living with unipolar depression. The statistical tools we develop will also be useful for discovering customized treatment protocols for people with a wide variety of mental health conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with mental health conditions and their health care providers often lack evidence for making choices about numerous treatment options and they do not have evidence-based, customized treatment plans. This project will develop customized treatment plans for unipolar depression and methods to generate these plans using data from electronic health care records. This work will address current limitations in statistical methods for selecting patient characteristics for customizing treatment, assessing bias from differences between people who take different medications, and calculating how many people are needed to accurately compare customized treatment plans using data from electronic health records.",Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support,9913586,R01MH114873,"['13 year old', 'Address', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'practice setting', 'precision medicine', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,372812,-0.0030659733199937113
"Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation Dissociative symptoms in traumatized individuals are common, debilitating, and costly; however, little is known about how its biological mechanisms interact with PTSD treatment. Traumatic dissociation broadly encompasses a range of distinct, yet clinically interrelated symptoms: depersonalization, derealization, amnesia, numbing, flashbacks, passive influence phenomena, and identity disturbances. Either alone or in various combinations, these symptoms serve as diagnostic criteria and commonly associated features across multiple psychiatric disorders. Traumatic dissociation is also associated with significant personal and societal burden. Traumatized individuals with dissociative symptoms typically have co-occurring psychiatric conditions, high rates of self-destructive behaviors and suicidality, and are disproportionate treatment utilizers. In addition, they are at increased risk for attrition, non-response and relapse following treatment interventions. Despite the significant and disabling nature of traumatic dissociative symptoms, little is known about the neurobiology of these processes and targeted interventions do not exist.  PTSD treatment studies have neither looked at neural intermediate phenotypes of dissociation, nor how these are associated with psychophysiological and digital phenotypes. Compared to clinical symptom measures, these biological and in-the-moment digital markers of dissociation may more robustly map onto the underlying core aspects of the disorder differentiating dissociation subtypes following childhood and adult trauma. We propose to build upon our prior Exploratory R21 to now capture longitudinal multimodal phenotype data related to dissociation, pre-, post- and during PTSD treatment modalities that include empirically-derived, exposure-based components.  The goals of this study will be 1) to understand the differential biomarkers that map onto dissociative symptoms, and 2) to understand how these biomarkers may best predict trajectory of response to empirically based standard-of-care treatments. For each of these Aims, we will collect Neuroimaging, Physiology, and Digital Phenotyping data, applying computational modeling with multimodal data to provide machine-learning based, unbiased predictive models of dissociative intermediate phenotypes at baseline and longitudinally. This naturalistic study will allow us to map the biology of dissociation, and importantly, the change in dissociative symptoms and underlying biomarkers over time, using naturalistic evidenced-based treatment for PTSD in 130 treatment-seeking patients with PTSD, and a range of dissociative symptoms.  Successful completion of these Aims will provide a novel and powerful understanding of the biological markers of dissociation subtypes following trauma exposure, and will identify biological mechanisms for understanding and treating PTSD with dissociation. Pathological trauma-related dissociation is a significant personal and societal burden. This proposal will examine behavioral and biological correlates of dissociation across imaging, physiology, and digital assessments. Results from this proposal will inform how to identify those at risk for these debilitating symptoms, potential brain regions to target for treatment, and may support a new standard of clinical care for PTSD with dissociation. ",Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation,9965404,R01MH119227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Amnesia', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depersonalization', 'Derealizations', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Dorsal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbness', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Destructive Behavior', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'digital', 'disabling symptom', 'emotion regulation', 'heart rate variability', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted therapy trials', 'time use', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,760581,0.024047757774934148
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,10004715,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'post-trauma', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2020,658730,0.02114315413261179
"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them. Project narrative Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo treatments induce active neurobiological processes related to patients’ expectations, learned associations, perceived care and support, and hope for the future. Studying placebo treatments provides a window into these crucial context variables that will help understand vulnerability and resilience to mental health disorders and beyond.

"Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Adolescent depression is a major public health concern associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We know that adolescent depression varies considerably in severity and course, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This proposal addresses this concern, aiming to identify biobehavioral predictors of illness trajectory in adolescents to inform treatment influencing its course. Our overall hypothesis is that reward dysfunction and its underlying neuro-immunological mechanisms contribute to maintenance of depression in youth. We propose the following model: (1) peripheral inflammation (e.g., cytokines, kynurenines) is associated with anhedonia; (2) inflammation extends to the CNS, inducing oxidative stress [↓glutathione (GSH, antioxidant)] and GABA (inhibitory neurotransmitter) deficits; (3) such neuro-chemical changes alter the reward circuitry, leading to anhedonia, and contribute to depression progression. In support, we documented that of adolescent depression’s core symptoms, only anhedonia—reflecting deficits in reward processes—and not irritability was associated with worse outcome, including suicidality and chronicity. We also reported associations between circulatory cytokines and kynurenines with both anhedonia and reward neurocircuitry. Utilizing proton MR spectroscopy (1H MRS), we showed that decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA in adolescent depression was driven by anhedonia. Additionally, using fMRI, we mapped striatal-based connectivity in relation to anhedonia and documented distinct neural activation patterns of reward anticipation and attainment—both reward processes that contribute to anhedonia. In pilot studies, we found that ACC GABA and reward- anticipation brain activation predicted anhedonia severity at 2-year follow-up. Building upon our compelling findings to date, we propose a prospective study of reward processes and neuroimmunological mechanisms, with the goal to identify modifiable pathways predictive of depression course in adolescents. We will study 120 adolescents with depressive symptoms. Three in-laboratory comprehensive clinical evaluation and computerized reward task sessions will be done at baseline, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. At baseline and 12 months, visits will include: a) immune blood collection for kynurenine metabolites, immune cell profiling, and cytokine secretion post immune stimulation (as a biological stressor); b) fMRI resting state and tasks examining distinct reward processes (e.g., anticipation, attainment, learning); and c) 1H MRS to probe ACC GABA and striatal GSH as indices for inflammatory neurometabolic consequences in reward-related brain regions. Outcome measures will include anhedonia severity (primary), along with depression severity, functioning, anxiety, and suicidality. Principled variable selection approach will address multiple comparison concerns. Dynamic causal modeling and machine learning classification methods will explore the relationships among all examined factors.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to better understand the mechanisms contributing to the maintenance and severity of adolescent depression. A prospective multimodal study will test the overall hypothesis that reward dysfunction and associated neuroimmunological abnormalities contribute to depression progression in youth. Such work would provide information on modifiable factors to facilitate novel treatment approaches influencing the course of illness early on and prior to chronicity effects, so that we may work to ameliorate morbidity and mortality of this devastating disorder.",Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression,9907663,R01MH120601,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Antioxidants', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Immune', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protons', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral construct', 'biobehavior', 'causal model', 'cell type', 'child depression', 'cingulate cortex', 'computerized', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pleasure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'reward anticipation', 'reward circuitry', 'sex', 'stressor', 'subthreshold depression']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,850634,-0.007897558452426097
"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Adolescent Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with CHANGEGRADIENTS with reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior a nd avoid risky substance use. It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment, CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.  REL EVAN CE (Se e in stru cti ons): The proposed research will develop and field test an innovative computationally-enabled personalized behavior change model that will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and is designed to be integrated into clinical practice.

"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9926317,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'comorbidity', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,838291,-0.007808200928685004
"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9890000,R01MH059929,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Exposure to', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'cognitive control', 'comorbidity', 'critical period', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'information processing', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical imaging', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'symptomatology', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,620389,0.02889154179422641
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology.

"Sex hormones and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Project summary The untreated burden of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the United States is a massive contributor to healthcare budgets in both the military and civilian sectors, and better treatment and prevention methods are needed. Fortunately, awareness of PTSD among military service members has grown in recent years, and yet, there is a hidden epidemic of PTSD among civilians and women. Women experience PTSD at about twice the rate of men (11% vs. 5%), but the causes for this sex difference are largely unknown. It has long been suspected that sex hormones play a major role in development of – and also potentially protection from – PTSD and other mental health disorders. This project will provide the largest ever study of sex hormone effects on PTSD and the related mental health outcomes of depression and anxiety disorders. Whereas studies in the past were limited by small sample sizes and results were inconclusive, this investigation will use a massive sample size of approximately 500,000 participants to answer questions about two well-known sex hormones (testosterone and estradiol) and three psychiatric outcomes (PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders). These variables were measured in the UK Biobank, and we have been granted access to the data to study sex hormone effects on mental health outcomes and to study genetic effects underlying both sex hormone levels and mental health disorders. The completion of this work will reveal whether rates of mental health disorders vary with testosterone and estradiol levels. It may be the case that levels of hormones that are both too high and too low are problematic. Given this reality, we will use sophisticated regression and machine learning techniques, and therefore we will be able to detect linear and non-linear relationships between sex hormones and PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. The sample size and study design make this the most powerful study conducted to date, and the results will be generalizable to diverse populations. In addition to the outcomes mentioned above, we will further explore genetic effects underlying relationships between sex hormones and mental health disorders. To do this, we will conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of both testosterone and estradiol. We will then make polygenic scores for testosterone and estradiol, yielding genetic proxies of sex hormone levels which can be used in studies in which sex hormones have not been measured. Finally, we will test for shared genetic effects between genetic effects on sex hormones and genetic effects on psychiatric disorders in order to better understand the etiology of these common, debilitating, and inadequately treated mental health disorders. Taken together, these findings will provide critical foundational knowledge relevant to clinical trials which are currently testing testosterone and estradiol as treatments for PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. These results will also provide actionable findings for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance Sex hormone altering medications are prescribed to over 40% of American adults, and yet the mental health consequences of sex hormones are still poorly understood. This project will be the largest ever investigation of sex hormone effects on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety disorders, and the results of this powerful study design will provide much-needed information relevant to the development of new treatment and prevention strategies.

"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",9955368,K08MH120341,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Partnership Practice', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Services', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'chatbot', 'comorbidity', 'computer program', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health service use', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'multiphase optimization strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'service delivery', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'success', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web site']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,179096,0.02707036466918568
"Distributed networks underlying depression in epilepsy: a computational circuit-based approach to biomarker development PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Adult patients with epilepsy have an increased prevalence of major depression and other psychiatric co- morbidities. Depression in epilepsy is associated with worse outcome and quality of life. However, it continues to be underdiagnosed and untreated and further attention to this comorbidity is critical. My career goal is to become an academic neuroscientist and clinician focused on understanding the neural networks underlying co- morbid mood and anxiety spectrum disorders in patients with epilepsy.  Specific brain circuits may underlie depression and be commonly affected by different precipitants (i.e. stress, inflammation, epilepsy). In this proposal, our model is that a set of neural features across these brain circuits will be shared across many patients with co-morbid depression. Evidence for a strong relationship between epilepsy and depression includes the presence of depression symptoms before, during, after, and in between seizures, evidence of cases of concurrent onset of depression and epilepsy, an increased incidence of interictal depression when limbic structures are involved in seizure occurrence, and evidence that depression scores may be lower after surgical resection for medication refractory epilepsy. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) captured during the pre-surgical recording period offers a particularly promising method to study depression networks in adult epilepsy, offering both high temporal resolution and spatial precision. Despite the enormous potential of iEEG, there are no studies to date that examine the neurophysiological signatures of network dysfunction in mood and anxiety disorders in patients with epilepsy. Such studies are critical in order to better understand the etiology of co-morbid depression and could lead to novel personalized therapies.  In our pilot work, we identify a set of power spectral measures within a corticolimbic circuit that appear to be linked to depression and are, therefore, a potential biomarker of co-morbid depression. We also found evidence that supports the basis for testing whether neural features will predict treatment outcome. This proposal builds on these preliminary findings to validate our model and test the hypothesis that a set of neural features is shared across some subjects with MDD in epilepsy and is detectable with machine-learning techniques applied to interictal iEEG recordings. Aim 1 demonstrates the relationship between resting state neural circuit abnormality and depression. Aim 2 tests whether removing the dysfunctional region of the circuit improves depression and whether the presurgical resting state iEEG predicts that improvement.  To address these research goals, I will need more rigorous training in computational neuroscience for complex datasets, advanced signal processing, and biostatistics. My training plan and carefully selected mentoring and advisory team across fields of psychiatry, neurosurgery, neurology and statistics will allow me to obtain the necessary experiences to become a fully independent investigator who brings the tools of computational approaches to the service of mental health research and novel personalized treatment paradigms in epilepsy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric co-morbidities in epilepsy are common, undertreated, and poorly understood. Using intracranial recordings in patients who will undergo epilepsy surgery for medication-refractory disease, we propose to test a model that a set of neural features is shared across subjects with depression in epilepsy. We will use computational modeling to identify biomarkers of co-morbid depression, and assess whether removing the dysfunctional region of the circuit improves depression and whether presurgical neural features predict that improvement.",Distributed networks underlying depression in epilepsy: a computational circuit-based approach to biomarker development,10016854,K23NS110962,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Atrophic', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Excision', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Montgomery and Asberg depression rating scale', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory Disease', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'anxiety spectrum disorders', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'career', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'network dysfunction', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'suicide rate', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,200178,-0.009849692631506644
"Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY Psychopathology is a very serious public health burden that not only affects adults, but also many children and adolescents. To better understand this devastating problem, the scientific community has focused its efforts on pinpointing the earliest developmental origins of psychopathology. A considerable literature now implicates prenatal stress as a critical determinant of poor psychological functioning in childhood and beyond. However, knowledge about whether the timing of prenatal stress differentially influences the development of child psychopathology is virtually unknown. Gaining such knowledge is the long-term goal of our research. This proposed project “piggybacks” on our current RO1-funded project (NICHD grant # R01HD085990) that is following a cohort of 335 women oversampled for life stress, with data collection starting at pregnancy week 15 until 6 months postpartum. We are conducting a granular assessment of pregnancy stress (measured weekly by maternal report) with the goal of understanding critical periods during fetal life when stress derails later infant behavioral and physiological stress responsivity. The overall objective of this new RO1 project is to follow this cohort into the child's preschool years. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will determine how the differential timing of prenatal stress influences behavior problems and psychopathology measured at age 4, how differences in self-regulation (an important precursor of mental health functioning) mediates the relationship between prenatal stress and psychopathology at age 4, and how these relationships differ between boys and girls. Aim 2 will test a host of postnatal risk factors (e.g., poor maternal mental health, poverty, intimate partner violence) and resilience factors (e.g., sensitive parenting, coping skills) as moderators of the effects of timing of prenatal stress on behavior problems and psychopathology at age 4. Importantly and uniquely, postnatal stress (mother and child) is assessed also in a fine-grained manner by every 3 month assessments from age 6 mos to 4 years. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use an exploratory statistical approach, machine learning, to detect which relatively small epochs of stress in postnatal life (measured every 3 months) interact with small epochs of prenatal stress to maximally influence child behavior problems and psychopathology. This project is innovative in its highly multimethod approach (e.g., behavioral observation, salivary analytes, laboratory tasks), its granular assessment of chronic and episodic prenatal and postnatal stressors, and the novel statistical approaches used to determine which epochs of stress are most relevant for psychopathology. This highly significant research will be the first longitudinal, prospective, multi-method study of how differential timing of prenatal stress influences the development of psychopathology, as mediated by child self-regulation and moderated by postnatal environmental factors. Thus, this study is critical for understanding how early child development sets the stage for psychopathology and will lead to increased understanding of the developmental epochs to be targeted for preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prenatal stress has devastating effects on children's neurobehavioral development, including elevating the risk for mental health disorders. What remains virtually unknown, however, is how the differential timing of prenatal stress affects the risk for later psychopathology, how this risk is mediated by children's capacity to self-regulate, and the role of the postnatal family environment in exacerbating or reducing this risk. The proposed study will provide essential information about how the timing of prenatal stress, child regulatory capacity, and the postnatal environment interact to increase risk for emerging psychopathology, which will inform strategies for developing and implementing interventions to prevent poor mental health and other negative child outcomes.",Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology,10048200,R01HD100469,"['4 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Preschool Child', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Salivary', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Stress', 'System', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavior observation', 'biobehavior', 'boys', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'early childhood', 'executive function', 'externalizing behavior', 'fetal', 'girls', 'innovation', 'intimate partner violence', 'maternal stress', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'sex', 'stress reactivity', 'stressor', 'virtual']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,675471,0.011508489156014065
"Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures,10107959,R00MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive signature', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R00,2020,248800,-0.0002970136429897388
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychopathology arising from a disruption of emotional function affects over 400 million people globally, yet we lack a neurobiological model to guide classification and treatment.

"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9967154,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'sociodemographics', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,614537,-0.008888468636699239
"Imaging the neurodevelopmental trajectory of depression and anxiety disorders with HCP protocols Project summary: The main objectives of this project are to perform longitudinal collection of clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data from a cohort of adolescents with depression and anxiety disorders, as well as healthy controls; and to develop a set of analytical tools that can be used to study the developmental trajectory of brain structure and function in this population. The project builds on the ongoing collaboration of our team in a Connectomes Related to Human Disease U01 project, the Boston Adolescent Neuroimaging of Depression and Anxiety (BANDA) study, where we have been performing extensive clinical characterization and MRI scanning with Human Connectome Project (HCP) protocols on adolescents with depression and/or anxiety disorders and healthy controls. These baseline data (current total: N=170; final target: N=225) are set to become available publicly through the HCP database. Here we propose to collect longitudinal data on this unique, thoroughly characterized cohort. Following up on these subjects will allow us to investigate the complex relationship between longitudinal changes in neural circuitry and the onset, persistence, or recurrence of depression and anxiety disorders. We will tackle this by bringing together an investigative team with strong expertise in adolescent mood disorders and in neuroimaging data analysis. The MPIs have extensive experience in developing publicly available software tools for the analysis of brain connections from diffusion MRI (Yendiki) and functional MRI (Whitfield-Gabrieli). In this project, we propose to develop robust, automated tools for segmenting deep-brain structures and white-matter pathways that are of interest in psychiatric disorders. This development will build on our prior work in unbiased methods for longitudinal morphometric and tractography analyses. We will leverage the proposed longitudinal dataset and tools for accurate delineation of individual anatomy to perform a number of novel analyses that will go beyond conventional group-wise comparisons. Specifically, we will focus on analyses that allow us to predict clinical outcomes in individual subjects based on their neural circuitry. We will use machine-learning techniques to map the normative developmental trajectory of brain structure and function in healthy adolescents, including our controls and those from the development HCP. We will then investigate how and when the trajectories of individual adolescents with depression and/or anxiety disorders deviate from this normative trajectory. The longitudinal data set that we will collect and the software tools that we will develop will be shared with the research community. Our analysis methods will be applicable beyond this cohort, and could be used to study disease mechanisms and predict outcomes in a wide range of brain-related disorders across the human lifespan. Project narrative: This project will follow up on a cohort of adolescents with depression and/or anxiety disorders and healthy controls to collect clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data over time. Depression and anxiety disorders diagnosed during adolescence predict negative long-term consequences in adulthood. Clarifying the neural circuitry that contributes to the onset, persistence, and recurrence of depression and anxiety disorders is a key step towards developing novel biomarkers for earlier diagnosis, as well as novel treatment targets for more effective therapeutics.",Imaging the neurodevelopmental trajectory of depression and anxiety disorders with HCP protocols,10057408,R56MH121426,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interest Group', 'Interview', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'age group', 'analytical tool', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior test', 'child depression', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparison group', 'connectome', 'data quality', 'disease mechanisms study', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'human data', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'method development', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'recruit', 'tool', 'tractography', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R56,2020,1225770,0.030873143784007892
"MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (COD) are common in the United States and providers have been challenged to provide effective treatments. As a consequence, their clients with COD may experience poor treatment engagement, symptom exacerbation and cycle in and out of emergency services. This is particularly true for underrepresented populations with a COD including individuals whom are homeless and involved in the criminally justice system. Research shows that integrated and coordinated community- based services for COD can improve client outcomes. However, healthcare workforce has a gap in training staff on such treatment techniques, which we aim to close via this Phase II STTR project.  Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is a unique evidence-based, trans-disciplinary treatment designed to address the complex needs of individuals with CODs and includes manuals for high risk populations of civilian and veteran homeless individuals as well as those involved in the criminally justice system. Listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration-Registry for Evidence Based Practices (NREPP), MISSION has had substantial impact. The Veterans Health Administration has deployed it in their national plan to end Veteran Homelessness. Massachusetts has used it in its Statewide Plan to End Homelessness and written it into Public Law for delivery alongside Veterans Treatment courts. While MISSION is a manualized treatment, a recent multisite implementation study identified the need for more comprehensive training tools. With NIAAA support, the University of Massachusetts Medical School (MISSION developers) partnered with Praxis on a Phase I STTR to (1) develop the MISSION University online training platform, (2) show proof of concept by implementing two training modules and an e-simulation case study, and (3) conduct a pilot randomized trial which demonstrated that training-as-usual Distance Learning (DL) + Technical Assistance (TA) outperformed TA alone.  In Phase II, we will complete MISSION U by developing and testing five new MISSION modules and companion e-simulations tools that test knowledge acquisition and application. We will first do a formative evaluation with 20 learners who will provide feedback on MISSION U modules. This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial similar to Phase I in which 60 learners will be randomized to the DL or the DL+TA conditions. In preparation for future scalability, we will uniquely conduct a qualitative process evaluation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework with 42 MISSION U participants to look at facilitators and barriers to implementation. Lastly, we will pilot test machine learning techniques with our 60 individuals who participated in the randomized trial in an effort to help personalize the MISSION U training experience for commercialization. !1 “MISSION U: A Multimedia Training Tool for Treatment of Individuals with Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders” is aimed at training providers of services for these individuals. MISSION U challenges prevailing provider training methodology that relies mainly on on-site provider training and/or online training using typical classroom-type materials. This project not only addresses the growing need for new provider training methodologies, but also offers the promise of improving clinical efficacy and reducing training costs and medical expenditures overall.! !",MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS,9942350,R42AA026751,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Assertiveness', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Community Outreach', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distance Learning', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency medical service', 'England', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based program', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laws', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Multimedia', 'National Health Services', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pre-Post Tests', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Videoconferences', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical efficacy', 'commercialization', 'community based service', 'computer science', 'cost', 'court', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'field study', 'formative assessment', 'health administration', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'outreach', 'peer', 'peer support', 'phase I trial', 'programs', 'prototype', 'provider networks', 'randomized trial', 'satisfaction', 'service providers', 'simulation', 'skills', 'sobriety', 'suicidal risk', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIAAA,"PRAXIS, INC.",R42,2020,738169,0.01621355074674383
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9980863,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,682143,-0.019239887338624116
"The Role of Social and Neural Connectedness in Predicting Neurodevelopmental Functioning in Adolescence PROJECT SUMMARY Few effective interventions exist for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which are associated with significant impairment, high rates of disability, and substantial public health costs. The prevalence of NDDs has increased considerably over the past two decades, and children with NDDs make up the largest proportion of youth that seek mental health treatment. Thus, novel approaches for understanding NDDs and identifying potential treatment targets for these disorders are needed. NDDs often have comorbid presentations and shared symptomatology (e.g., impaired social functioning), which suggests that using a transdiagnostic approach to study NDDs may be informative. This approach could reveal modifiable factors and underlying neurobiological mechanisms that could be targeted through intervention to reduce neurodevelopmental symptomatology. Social connectedness (i.e., extracurricular involvement, family dynamics, and relationships with peers and parents) may be a salient protective factor for youth with neurodevelopmental symptomatology. An important neural correlate for social functioning appears to be functional connectivity within the salience network (SN), which is involved in detection of relevant stimuli (e.g., changes in other's emotional expressions).Thus, social connectedness and related connectivity within the SN may be predictive of neurodevelopmental outcomes. The potential protective role of these factors may be particularly salient during adolescence, which is a vulnerable period for many of the negative outcomes associated with NDDs. The proposed longitudinal project will capitalize on the multi-level framework of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study by using psychosocial, functional neuroimaging, and cognitive data from two timepoints (i.e., baseline and one-year follow-up) to assess neurodevelopmental functioning in a sample of >11,500 youth in early adolescence. The project will be conducted at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research, which is an ABCD study site. The aims of the proposed project are threefold: to determine whether 1) social connectedness is associated with SN functional connectivity cross-sectionally; 2) social connectedness predicts future neurodevelopmental function; and 3) SN functional connectivity predicts future neurodevelopmental function. These aims will be assessed using linear mixed effects models with relevant covariates included (e.g., baseline neurodevelopmental function, youth ethnicity, youth gender, and family income). The proposed study has an exploratory aim of utilizing a data-driven, machine learning approach to identify additional modifiable factors (e.g., sleep, physical activity, screen time) that predict future neurodevelopmental function. The project is novel in that it takes a transdiagnostic approach to studying NDDs, it is longitudinal, and it has the potential for replication and extension as future data are released. Results from the project could have meaningful clinical relevance with the potential for identifying treatment targets for future interventions aiming to improve neurodevelopmental symptomatology in early adolescence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Because neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are associated with significant impairment and public health costs and few psychological interventions are known to be effective for reducing neurodevelopmental symptomatology, identification of novel treatment targets for individuals with NDDs is needed. The present longitudinal study will address this need by utilizing a large, nationally-representative sample of youth (N = 11,500+; age 9-10) to examine the roles of social connectedness (i.e., extracurricular involvement, family dynamics, and relationships with peers and parents) and related neural connectedness (i.e., functional connectivity within the salience network) in predicting future neurodevelopmental functioning (indexed by both parent-reported symptoms and objective executive function tasks). Results from this study could therefore delineate modifiable social factors and underlying neural mechanisms that are protective against neurodevelopmental symptomatology in early adolescence and inform future clinical research.",The Role of Social and Neural Connectedness in Predicting Neurodevelopmental Functioning in Adolescence,10066511,F31HD103340,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Family dynamics', 'Foundations', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Social Functioning', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive development', 'comorbidity', 'data collection site', 'developmental psychology', 'disability', 'early adolescence', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'large datasets', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'showing emotion', 'skills', 'social', 'social factors', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trait', 'tv watching']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TULSA,F31,2020,44712,-0.030714840663460613
"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life. Project Narrative Bipolar disorder typically begins in adolescence; recurrent mood symptoms during this period can have a devastating impact on a person's ability to achieve a high quality of life. Digital phenotyping, defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors, may make it possible to better understand and predict the onset of mood symptoms with minimal burden to the individual.

"MINDS Imaging Ancillary Study Dramatic advances in management of congenital heart disease (CHD) have improved survival to adulthood from <10% in the 1960's to nearly 90% in the current era. With this shifting demographic, adult CHD (ACHD) patients now outnumber pediatric CHD patients.1 ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits such as impairment in executive function, associated with reduced quality of life that includes deficits in educational attainment and social interaction.2-7 These deficits are related to risk factors that can occur across the lifespan, including genetic abnormalities, cumulative hypoxic/ischemic injury, and, adult-onset atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Our overarching hypothesis is that ACHD patients exhibit vascular brain injury and structural/physiological brain alterations that are predictive of specific neurocognitive deficits, including executive dysfunction, which are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR (e.g., level of education and lifestyle/social habits). We propose an ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD).” We will leverage the MINDS-ACHD parent study data (i.e., NIH Toolbox neuropsychological battery/clinical data/biological samples) and our established neuroimaging harmonization, which we currently use for the PHN Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVRIII) multi-center brain connectome study (R01-HL128818; PI-Panigrahy), to measure neuroimaging biomarkers in ACHD patients at the same PHN sites. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim #1 (brain injury): To determine if vascular-related brain injury (cortical infarcts, hemosiderin lesions, and white matter hyperintensity) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox total composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #2 (brain structure): To determine if reduced fronto-temporal cortical thickness and white matter connectivity are associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox frontal executive sub-score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #3 (brain physiology): To determine if reduced cerebrovascular reserve (regional cerebral blood flow/ resting BOLD imaging) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox crystallized composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #4 (cognitive reserve): To determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. Given the paucity of multi-modal neuroimaging studies in ACHD, our proposed study addresses a major knowledge gap in the ACHD population by providing insight into the mechanism underlying impaired neurocognitive outcomes. Our study will provide structural-physiological correlates of neurocognitive outcomes, representing the first multi-center neuroimaging study to be performed in ACHD. Importantly, other behavioral and environmental enrichment data will be integrated with these neuroimaging and neurocognitive outcome data to model cognitive reserve. Results from this research will help shape the care of ACHD patients, and further our understanding of the interplay between brain injury and cognitive reserve. The proposed ancillary study is thus both feasible and cost-effective by leveraging the NHLBI-PHN infrastructure As such, the proposed research is well aligned with the NHLBI's Strategic Vision. Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) now outnumber children with CHD. ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits and reduced quality of life, including lower educational attainment and less social interaction. The mechanism of neurocognitive impairment in the ACHD population is unknown and few neuroimaging studies in this population exist. We propose a multi-modal neuroimaging ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study” (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease to correlate multi-modal neuroimaging biomarkers in relation to neurocognitive outcome. We will also determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of cognitive reserve, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. These ACHD studies will foster development of future clinical translational studies or trials of preventive strategies to improve neurocognitive outcome in this population.",MINDS Imaging Ancillary Study,10001823,R01HL152740,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ancillary Study', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Trauma', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Common Ventricle', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Educational Background', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Habits', 'Heart', 'Hemosiderin', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life Style', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Translational trial', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'aged', 'brain abnormalities', 'cerebrovascular', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'executive function', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'ischemic injury', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'prevent', 'protective factors', 'randomized trial', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'translational study', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,526873,-0.013430854196317303
"Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans Chronic dysregulation of physiological systems manifests systemically as allostatic load (AL) and in abnormal stress reactivity profiles, which are features of psychopathological conditions that increase future disease risk. But the biological basis underlying inter-individual differences in stress regulation and reactivity remains unknown. Even among populations of healthy individuals exposed to standardized laboratory challenges, such as the Trier social stress test (TSST), there are substantial differences in the magnitude of responses in multiple physiological systems, including but not limited to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and cardiovascular system, metabolic changes, and immune and pro-inflammatory systems. One common factor to all stress systems is their dependence on energy supply, which fuels every aspect of the stress response including molecular, cellular, systemic and cognitive/psychological functioning. At the cellular level, energy is provided by mitochondria, unique organelles that populate the cell cytoplasm and contain their own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), that is essential to mitochondrial health. MtDNA defects cause dysregulation of multiple aspects of mitochondrial structure and function, known as mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL). Three main lines of evidence suggest that MAL contributes to AL and regulates stress responses in humans: i) we recently discovered that the mtDNA is released following psychological stress in humans (PNEC 2019), ii) experimentally-induced MAL in animals caused specific alterations in the multisystem physiological responses to psychological stress (PNAS 2015), and iii) mitochondria are the source of stress hormones, including cortisol that is synthesized in mitochondria within the adrenal glands (Nat Genetics 2012). Together, this evidence suggests that MAL may alter both baseline AL and stress reactivity profiles, potentially providing new insight into the source of interindividual differences in stress regulation and health in general. In this project, we perform the first comprehensive assessment of MAL, systemic AL, multisystem stress reactivity to a laboratory challenge (TSST) in three groups of individuals who have rare genetic mtDNA defects that selectively causes different forms of MAL and in a healthy control group. Multisystem stress biomarker profiling under fasting baseline and stress reactive conditions will provide a comprehensive test of pathways linking MAL to stress physiology in humans. The resulting high-dimensionality data will be treated using integrative data analytic approaches and classifying algorithms, including cross-validated machine learning models, to identify resting and stress-reactive biomarker signatures responsive to MAL. In parallel, assessments of executive function and key domains of psychosocial functioning including mood, stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and well-being will contribute to provide a comprehensive picture of novel mitochondrial psychobiological pathways. NARRATIVE There are large unexplained inter-individual differences in systemic allostatic load and stress reactivity, which may in part be explained by mitochondria. Here we study the effects of chronic dysregulation of mitochondrial function – mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL) – on multisystem stress regulation in humans. This project will establish the influence of MAL on baseline AL as well as multisystem stress reactivity profiles, defining novel psychobiological pathways by which mitochondria may contribute to the maintenance of health and resilience, and to disease risk.",Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans,9947362,R01MH122706,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Cytoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Energy Supply', 'Esthesia', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fasting', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gatekeeping', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hematology', 'Hormones', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'IL6 gene', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammatory', 'Inherited', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Ploidies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Respiratory Chain', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trier Social Stress Test', 'allostatic load', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cognitive function', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'executive function', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'negative affect', 'negative mood', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'stress reactivity', 'trait', 'urinary']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,815629,-0.005919895919801272
"Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders Project Summary: Early life psychosocial adversity and stress are well-established as the most powerful environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children. Impairments in developing emotion regulation and cognitive control and associated alterations in brain development have been shown to mediate the effects of adversity on risk for the development of psychopathology. Early psychosocial adversity impacts the epigenetic and inflammation-mediated processes that contribute to these negative outcomes, a process known as “biological embedding of stress.” While this risk trajectory has been clearly linked to increased rates of psychopathology, the mechanisms of this process, its targetable mediators and how early in development they operate are yet to be determined. Here we focus on the effects of early life adversity on brain, emotion regulation and cognitive control outcomes relevant to risk for mental disorders, beginning antenatally and extending to age 3. We will examine the role of pre- and postnatal adversity/stress, the maternal and child perinatal gut microbiome and early caregiver support on these key neurodevelopmental outcomes utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging. Our unifying hypothesis is that these factors modulate systemic inflammatory responses, induce neuronal effects through this and other processes that adversely impact brain development in limbic and cortical regions, and mediate the effects of early adversity on child emotion regulation, cognitive control and mental health outcomes. These factors will be studied in a unique, prospectively ascertained cohort of 370 mothers and their offspring at high psychosocial risk being recruited as part of an already funded March of Dimes project at Washington University. The cohort will include both term- and prematurely-born infants and toddlers given the increased risk of psychosocial adversity and aberrant gut microbiome in preterm children. The offspring will be intensively prospectively studied from the 1st trimester to age 3, providing a unique dataset in which to examine the interrelationships among pre- and postnatal adversity, biomarkers of inflammation, the gut microbiome and developmental and mental health outcomes. The perinatal and early childhood periods are critical times to study these exposures as adverse neurodevelopment associated with adversity begins in utero through fetal programming. Likewise, the perinatal period is a critical developmental window for microbial influences, when gut microbial colonization has its most enduring effects. The proposed study merges established research groups in these areas in a center with advanced infant and childhood neuroimaging and extensive microbiome expertise, and offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand the mechanisms of the biological embedding of adversity on brain, cognitive and emotional trajectories in a high-risk cohort. We will also apply innovative computational methods, using Deep Learning, to extend understanding of these data. Findings will provide critical and novel insights to inform early preventive interventions relevant to emotional, cognitive and mental health outcomes for children at greatest risk. Project Narrative This study will investigate the mechanisms by which psychosocial adversity experienced in utero and early in life impact the child’s brain, cognitive and emotional development, testing the hypothesis that stress and adversity during pregnancy adversely affect early brain development through inflammatory mechanisms. Another important focus of this project is to examine how the maternal perinatal microbiome and infant’s gut microbiome during early childhood impact brain development, either through the infant’s inflammatory response or other effects. A third focus is to explore the effects of caregiver support on this risk trajectory, testing the idea that high caregiver support reduces the negative influences of early adversity, altered immune biomarkers and disruptions in the gut microbiome.","Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders",9929031,R01MH113883,"['3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caregiver support', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Funding', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informal Social Control', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mothers', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Poverty', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'antenatal', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'gray matter', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiome', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal period', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,2343175,0.013457563395094489
"Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) are at increased risk for numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, substance use, HIV/AIDS, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Despite clear documentation and replication of these health disparities, relatively little is known about their development from adolescence into adulthood. Two theories primarily dominate the literature. Minority stress models describe unique life stressors experienced only by sexual minorities (e.g., victimization and discrimination based on sexual orientation) as primary contributors to health disparities. Other models implicate both minority stress and normative psychosocial processes together as contributors to health disparities. Some such normative processes include (1) psychological adjustment and characteristics (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, substance use expectancies), (2) disrupted social systems (e.g., family, peers, school), and (3) individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, temperament). To date, most studies of both minority stress and normative processes are limited by use of cross-sectional samples of primarily Caucasian adults. Although much has been learned from these studies, they do not permit analysis of emerging health disparities across development. Existing research is therefore limited in terms of both generalizability to diverse populations, and validity of directionality inferences between observed ‘predictors’ and ‘outcomes’. My long-term career goals are to identify mechanisms leading to disparities among sexual minorities, with the goal of improving treatments for these disparities, and to develop screening tools to identify high-risk youth who would benefit from prevention programs. To reach this goal, in this project, I address existing limitations to the literature using a prospective sample of individuals who were 14-19 years old at baseline and followed for over 4 years. My goal is to describe developmental trajectories and mechanisms of health disparity development for sexual minority youth compared with heterosexual youth across a 10-year developmental window spanning ages 14- 23 years. Longitudinal outcomes include depression/anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, sleep, general physical health, disordered eating and substance use. Developmental trajectories for these outcomes will be charted by gender and sexual orientation. Confirmatory analyses based on existing literature will be conducted to examine relations between minority stress and adverse outcomes. Then, I will use machine learning to identify as-yet unknown predictors of adverse outcomes and health disparities and characterize any changes in prediction across time. Finally, I will use state-of-the art intervening variable analyses (mediation, moderation) to evaluate longitudinal mechanisms through which health disparities emerge. Findings should provide insight into mechanisms of disparity development and maintenance, informing prevention and intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) experience wide-ranging disparities in mental and physical health that often persist into adulthood, yet little is known about development of these disparities. This research (1) examines developmental trajectories in mental and physical health outcomes from adolescence to young adulthood among sexual minority and matched heterosexual youth, (2) uses advanced statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to identify hypothesized and currently unknown factors that predict disparities over time, and (3) elucidates pathways to adversity and resilience. Experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual youth and young adults will be compared to uncover possible differences in developmental experiences that lead to health disparities, with possible implications for prevention and intervention among a highly vulnerable population.",Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing,9929425,F31MD014052,"['19 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Asthma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Documentation', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expectancy', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterosexuals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spirituality', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Victimization', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'emerging adult', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'non-heterosexual', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer victimization', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'resilience', 'sexual identity', 'sexual minority', 'sexual risk behavior', 'social', 'social factors', 'stressor', 'substance misuse', 'theories', 'treatment disparity', 'young adult']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,33937,0.02396419597662147
"From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models PROJECT SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating neuropsychiatric illness that affects 2-5% of youth and causes morbidity, functional impairment, and suicide. Prodromal manic symptoms without manic episodes usually emerge before BD types I and II (BD-I/II) develop, but less than 60% of youth with manic symptoms will develop BD-I/II. The uncertainty of diagnosis and illness progression results in potentially detrimental interventions and 7-10 years delay appropriate treatments. It is thus imperative that objective biomarkers of risk for conversion to BD-I/II are identified and tested in youth before the peak onset of illness. Given that neural measures of structure and function associated with emotion and reward processing, in combination with clinical and behavior measures, can improve prediction of psychiatric outcomes in youth, this project will investigate brain-behavior relations in the most severely ill youth during inpatient stays and aims to build a predictive model of BD. We aim to use two distinct analytic models to test our hypotheses. First a general linear model (GLM) with a machine learning (ML) model of regularized regression with cross validation and second a whole brain ML pattern recognition model. We will first identify neural and behavioral markers of BD-I/II in circuitry associated with emotion and reward processing. We hypothesize that decreased activity and connectivity in prefrontal, amygdala, and striatal regions and behavioral measures showing less sleep, lower activity, and poorer mood and cognition will distinguish BD- I/II from clinically matched youth without mania and healthy. Next, we will identify using ML a whole brain neural classifier of BD-I/II relative to clinically matched inpatients without mania. Aim 2 is to, after two years, identify and quantify the neural and behavioral measures that predict conversion to BD-I/II, and to test individual conversion in an independent group of high symptomatic risk adolescents. Aim 3 is to identify brain-behavior associations for app development. Training samples include mid-/post- pubertal adolescents aged 13-17 years recruited from the nation’s only specialized inpatient unit for adolescents with BD and the general adolescent unit at our hospital; 70 well-characterized adolescents with BD-I/II, a clinically matched group of 70 inpatient youth without mania. Testing sample is an independent group of 180 adolescents with manic symptoms without BD-I/II. 60 healthy controls will be recruited. The project includes emotion and reward processing neural function and structure, clinical and behavioral measures including sleep and activity with actigraphy, computerized cognitive measures, and self-reports during inpatient evaluation and for two weeks post discharge. At two-year follow up, clinical assessments will confirm diagnoses. This is the first study to employ a multimodal assessment of behavior and mood symptoms combined with multimodal imaging methods to comprehensively assess disease-specific abnormalities and prediction of BD-I/II. Findings from this study may identify biological and behavioral markers of conversion to BD-I/II in adolescents and may contribute developing disease-specific risk calculators, low-cost biosensors for mobile applications, and novel targets of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescents may experience manic symptoms that may or may not progress into bipolar disorder. This proposed longitudinal study would be the first of its kind and could shed light on the neural and behavioral markers of disease progression in high-risk adolescents with manic symptoms.

"Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood traumatic stress (CTS), resulting from experiences such as abuse and neglect, is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences effecting overall health across the lifespan. Growing evidence shows that the negative effects of CTS are not limited to a single individual and may be transmitted across generations, increasing the risk for behavioral and psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Psychological stress during pregnancy is associated with heightened stress responses, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral problems in infancy and early childhood potentially making it a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The majority of studies examining maternal psychological stress (MPS) during pregnancy consider the magnitude of stress as the `risk factor' for alterations in offspring development; however, psychological stress, particularly during the prenatal period, is dynamic and variable. Infant neurodevelopment occurs sequentially and is sensitive to environmental influences, meaning that the effect of any insult is likely as much about the timing, as it is the magnitude. As a result, it remains unclear which aspects of stress most strongly impact offspring development – is it simply the magnitude as previously suggested, or does the trajectory matter as well? Understanding the variability of prenatal factors and their influence on infant neurobiological and psychosocial development is critical to targeting preventive interventions. The goal of this proposal is to explore maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress. The overall hypothesis is that a history of maternal CTS will increase the amplitude and velocity of MPS trajectories compared to a low-risk group, will predict increased offspring limbic system connectivity and negative affect expression, and that an intervention to reduce MPS in a high-risk sample will alter the observed trajectories. These hypotheses will be tested using a novel methodology that characterizes the longitudinal heterogeneity of psychological symptom data to create MPS trajectories. These trajectories will be used to explore the role of timing and rate of change of MPS on offspring neurobiological and affective development and, further, to test whether these trajectories mediate the effects of CTS on infant development. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To characterize the longitudinal heterogeneity of MPS in a sample of women with and without a history of CTS; (2) To examine the effects of heterogeneous longitudinal trajectories in MPS on offspring limbic system and negative affect development in mothers with and without childhood trauma; and (3) (Exploratory) To determine whether an intervention designed to reduce MPS will alter MPS trajectories in a high-risk sample. This study aims to elucidate the importance of trajectories of MPS for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS. Achieving these goals will provide insight into the best timing for targeted screening and interventions to alter MPS during pregnancy for women with a history of CTS and, thereby, reduce the risk of offspring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood traumatic stress is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences for psychological well-being, such as increased stress reactivity and increased risk for perinatal psychopathology. The proposed research will integrate tools from developmental neuroscience, clinical science, and computer science to: (1) examine the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a potential mediator of childhood traumatic stress on infant brain and negative affect development; and (2) evaluate whether an intervention designed to reduce maternal psychological stress will alter the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal prenatal stress. By identifying the importance of trajectories of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS, this work stands to improve the targeting and timing of prenatal interventions for women with a history of childhood traumatic stress.",Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress,9999677,F30MH118762,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Limbic System', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'maternal risk', 'maternal stress', 'mindfulness based cognitive therapy', 'negative affect', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatric trauma', 'prenatal', 'prenatal intervention', 'prenatal stress', 'psychological symptom', 'psychosocial development', 'random forest', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'stress reactivity', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,0.007862686786865603
"Developmental Variations in Corticostriatal Thalamocortical Circuits and their Relationship to Psychopathology ABSTRACT Detailed characterizations of brain development are essential to understanding factors underlying the emergence of psychopathology and its progression. Corticostriatal thalamocortical (CSTC) circuits are central to current models of both externalizing and internalizing psychopathologies. However, our understanding of their development and the impact of pathologic processes on these circuits is primarily limited to regional structural properties and specific disorders (e.g., Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). As such, there is a need for a more comprehensive examination of CSTC circuit development and its relations to psychopathology. The overarching goals of the proposed work are to characterize the development of CSTC circuits using structural MRI and resting state functional MRI, and to link variations in their trajectories to the emergence of psychopathology. We will model developmental trajectories of structural morphology and functional interactions within seven CSTC networks defined based on their connectivity with large-scale cortical networks and relate deviations to externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Consistent with recent calls for secondary analysis of existing datasets to accelerate the identification of brain-behavior relationships that may serve as modifiable clinical targets, the proposed work will make use of openly shared pediatric imaging datasets (ages: 5.0-24.0; high resolution T1 anatomical and resting state functional scans for each participant). Specifically, we will generate a large-scale aggregate cross-sectional sample (n = 3918) for the purposes of delineating trajectories for the seven CSTC networks. We train age-prediction models for each of the networks and pool their predictions to generate multivariate CSTC maturity profiles for each individual. These profiles will be used to subtype individuals into neurobiologically homogenous subgroups, which are expected to differ with respect to dimensional measures of psychopathology calculated using the bifactor model framework (i.e. general psychopathology [p-factor], internalizing, externalizing). An aggregate longitudinal sample (n = 250; 3 time- points per participant, each 12-15 months apart) will be generated to evaluate the ability of changes in CSTC maturity profiles over time to predict longitudinal changes in psychopathology. Specific aims of the proposed work are to: 1) Estimate the developmental trajectories of seven CSTC networks; 2) Determine associations between CSTC network maturity profile subtypes and dimensions of psychopathology; and 3) Evaluate predictive relationships between longitudinal changes in maturity profiles and those in dimensions of psychopathology. Given the scale of the datasets employed, cloud-based computing, and optimized analytic frameworks will be leveraged to ensure the feasibility of achieving the proposed work within the project period. All codes developed will be openly shared.

"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology.

"Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY This application aims to advance our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) by combining genetic information and analyzing speech patterns of those with MDD to identify subtypes. MDD is the leading cause of disability throughout the world, yet, relative to other common disorders, less is known about its origins. There are less effective treatments and much less is spent on trying to understand how it arises and how to cure it. Current treatments are relatively ineffective, with up 50% of patients refractory and many suffering severe recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MDD has been recognized as a grand challenge in global mental health. Thus, developing new treatments for MDD is a major priority for public health. A major challenge for MDD research is the presence of heterogeneity. The existence of multiple subtypes of MDD has been suspected for a long time, and likely confounds the ability to treat the disorder appropriately with existing treatments, as well as making it hard to identify the causes of MDD as a prelude to developing new treatments. However finding subtypes has been hard. Given that the way people talk can reflect alterations in mood, we expect voice to be able to predict mood, and hence potentially be used as biomarker to recognize heterogeneity. In preliminary data show that in combination with genetic data high-dimensional vocal features extracted from recordings can be used to identify subtypes. Furthermore, the use of genetic data allows us to impute voice features into large biobanks where no recordings exist, making it possible to explore the relationship between vocal features and a rich array of clinically important indicators. We explore the power of voice to make a diagnosis of MDD, to predict severity and other clinical features. Applying our approach to will inform clinical management, improving diagnosis, refine treatment and aid the development of new treatments PROJECT NARRATIVE The research proposed here will contribute to an understanding of major depressive disorder, the commonest psychiatric disorder and a leading cause of disability throughout the world. The proposal will combine information from voice recordings and genetics to identify subtypes of depression and develop robust predictors of mood, severity of illness and other clinical indicators.

During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data PROJECT SUMMARY This study will leverage large-scale clinical data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify existing pharmaceutical agents commonly prescribed for a multitude of indications that are incidentally associated with improvements in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Through prior efforts, a data source containing almost 20 years of treatment data on all (over one million) VA users diagnosed with PTSD between October 1999 and February 2018 has been constructed, including a complete historical record of their evidence-based medication and psychotherapy receipt within the VA healthcare system. Importantly, the team has also amassed symptom-level patient-reported PTSD outcome data for hundreds of thousands of these patients. The existing data is a powerful resource with which the research team proposes to explore the following specific aims: (1) identify off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms over time; (2) further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of newly-identified off-label pharmaceutical agents for improvement in PTSD symptoms using rigorous causal methods; and (3) identify common adverse events related to off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms in this complex, psychiatrically and medically ill population The proposed project will identify agents that may merit further rigorous clinical evaluation for psychiatric benefit. New therapeutic targets may be identified that will lead to greater treatment options or specific treatments. Further, identification of off-label medications that improve or have contraindicated effects for psychiatric populations will provide critical guidance to practicing clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, there are few psychopharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and available medications do not work sufficiently. In a recent published statement, NIMH noted that “The National Institute of Mental Health would relish the chance to partner with our VA colleagues to exploit [VA data] with the aim of providing guidelines for evidence-based pharmacotherapy for those suffering from PTSD, Veterans and civilians alike.” The proposed study was specifically designed in response to that call; it will use exploratory methods to identify off-label medications that are effective for the treatment of PTSD using a large VA medical records-based dataset.",Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data,9858600,R01MH121397,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Paroxetine', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Scanning', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label drug', 'prospective', 'psychopharmacologic', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy development', 'treatment guidelines', 'venlafaxine', 'working group']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,648991,0.0031024258036020593
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of “non-monotone” missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ﬂawed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ﬁxed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiﬁc domains, making “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiﬁc reporting. Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Narrative We will develop, implement and disseminate an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software tool to evaluate the robustness to missing data assumptions of clinical trials in which binary outcomes are collected at ﬁxed points over time but where participants intermittently miss their scheduled assess- ments, as frequently occurs in addiction research. We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiﬁc reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9923614,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical trial analysis', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,100287,0.019299111987991342
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, and involves a complicated interplay between functional infor- mation interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. functional and structural measures. However, the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities misses a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimen- sional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we devel- oped advanced approaches to capture high-dimensional relationships among 2 or more modalities. Our work continues to strongly support the benefits of multimodal data fusion to both provide a more complete picture of brain function and structure, but also to improve our ability to study and predict the impact of complex mental illness. In this new phase of the project, we will focus on methods that can fill some existing gaps, such as the ability to bridge spatial/temporal as well as structural/functional connectivity scales. We also propose a novel framework to integrate unimodal and multimodal features called chromatic fusion, which searches for combina- tions of multimodal `notes' which occupy a unique position in a latent (or dictionary) space. The proposed meth- ods will be validated using simulations, hybrid-data, and large N normative imaging data. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly tested using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symp- toms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression). We will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via GitHub and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 37 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and our work has clearly shown the substantial benefits of ex- tracting multimodal features estimated jointly from the data. In this renewal, we focus on some key understudied areas including fusing across vast spatiotemporal and functional/structural connectivity scales as well as devel- oping powerful new frameworks for integrating the resulting information to enable decision making and enable identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. Completion of our aims will result in a powerful new toolkit for data fusion of multimodal brain imaging data. 36",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,10058554,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data fusion', 'data reduction', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'white matter']",NIBIB,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,542808,0.004931773836297146
"Optimizing prediction of preschool psychopathology from brain: behavior markers of emotion dysregulation from birth: A computational, developmental cognitive neuroscience approach PROJECT SUMMARY: Internalizing/externalizing psychopathologies are identifiable by age 3, with neurodevelopmental risk markers evident in infants. Despite powerful implications for prevention, clinical impact has been minimal. We use innovative computational and epidemiologic data science methods to accelerate clinical translation of neurodevelopmental discovery during infancy towards generalizable risk prediction for preschool psychopathology. Our main objective is generating a pragmatic clinical risk calculator for public health use, the Mental Health Risk Calculator for Young Children (MHRiskCalc-YC). To achieve necessary power and precision, we create the Mental Health, Earlier Synthetic Cohort (MHESC), pooling multiple extramural cohorts at Washington University and Northwestern University to form the first clinically- enriched “synthetic” neuroimaging cohort for generation of neurodevelopmentally-based clinical risk algorithms (N=1,020, followed from birth-54 mos.). To maximize the risk calculator's clinical and research utility and cost effectiveness, we will generate a series of risk algorithms tailored to envisioned end-users, incorporating input from clinical stakeholders. Algorithms will also establish added value of pre-postnatal environmental factors in risk prediction, a crucial but understudied RDoC element. Aim 1 optimizes clinical feasibility and cost effectiveness by generating an MHRiskCalc-YC algorithm derived solely from commonly used survey data to optimize feasibility for future use in primary care settings. Aim 2 optimizes precision of prediction by establishing statistical and clinical incremental utility of more intensive assessment for future use in mental health specialty settings. This algorithm sequentially tests the added predictive value of methods of intermediate-high intensity (from direct assessments to EEG to MRI) for most precise, least burdensome risk prediction. The Aim 3 algorithm is optimized for future clinical research use in neurodevelopmental consortia, modeling the added value of MRI data to the Aim 1 algorithm. This mirrors “common” protocols of neuroimaging consortia and will also generate an empirically-derived best practices guide for consortia to optimize timing/ number of neuroimaging assessments. External validity will be established in the Baby Connectome Project (BCP). The MHESC capitalizes on an unprecedented, time-sensitive opportunity to accelerate scientific and clinical impact of multiple extramural activities that have been extensively pre-aligned. The public health impact of an infancy-based clinical risk prediction tool for preschool psychopathology has transformative potential for altering standard of care in early identification and prevention of mental disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Mental disorders are often early-onset chronic diseases, with brain and behavioral risk markers of common internalizing/externalizing problems evident in infancy. To accelerate translation, we will use multi-method imaging, behavioral and data science innovations to generate an infant mental health risk calculator for pragmatic public health use, derived from a clinically enriched “Mental Health Earlier-Synthetic Cohort” of 1,020 infants using established study samples (characterized from birth-54 months). Clinical prediction algorithms will deliver broadly useful tools for earlier prediction and prevention of mental disorder and parameters to inform when imaging methods will be most informative in large-scale neurodevelopmental studies.","Optimizing prediction of preschool psychopathology from brain: behavior markers of emotion dysregulation from birth: A computational, developmental cognitive neuroscience approach",10056737,R01MH121877,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Extramural Activities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Height', 'Infant', 'Interview', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Studies', 'Science', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effectiveness', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early onset', 'emotion dysregulation', 'epidemiologic data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'mental disorder prevention', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary care setting', 'protective factors', 'relating to nervous system', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,1858980,0.032988175654101184
"Refining and Validating Borderline Personality Disorder Phenotypes Through Factor Mixture Modeling The proposed research seeks to clarify the symptomatic heterogeneity of borderline personality disorder (BPD) by examining BPD phenotypes through advanced latent variable modeling. A second, innovative aim is to validate these findings through intensive longitudinal assessment in daily life. BPD is associated with high rates of emergency room visits and costly healthcare service utilization, affecting 10-20% of psychiatric outpatients and 20-40% of psychiatric inpatients. BPD also contributes to impaired social and occupational functioning and significant suicide risk, with 1 in 10 individuals with BPD completing suicide. Recent research has aimed to enhance treatment effectiveness for BPD by identifying prototypical patterns of symptom manifestation that may suggest ideographic treatment targets. However, no research has simultaneously included: a) a sufficiently large patient sample; b) ecologically sound validation of results; and c) use of appropriate statistical techniques. The proposed project builds on this research through two aims. Aim 1: Utilize a model comparison approach to identify BPD phenotypes in a large psychiatric outpatient sample assessed via semi-structured diagnostic interviews (Study 1). Aim 2: Validate the results of Study 1 by applying phenotype classification algorithms produced in Study 1 to a smaller sample of patients who have completed 21 days of momentary surveys on symptoms and clinical outcomes (Study 2). To address Aim 1, factor mixture modeling (FMM)—a novel, flexible, and integrative latent variable modeling approach—will be compared to standard factor analysis and latent class analysis in order to evaluate the dimensional and categorical structure of BPD. We expect a single-factor, multi-class FMM will best explain heterogeneity in BPD, over and above other sources of heterogeneity (e.g., gender, comorbidity). To address Aim 2, we will use a prototype-matching approach to algorithmically assign patients in the validation sample to phenotypes identified in Aim 1 and determine their predictive validity in terms of daily clinical outcomes. Results of this project will provide empirically grounded personalized prediction tools for BPD intervention and treatment development, in line with the NIMH’s goal of “developing, testing, and refining tools and methodologies… for personalized risk and trajectory prediction and intervention.” This fellowship will allow the applicant to receive tailored consultation from experts in methodology, data analysis, and BPD theory and assessment, as well as advanced statistical training and grantsmanship courses and workshops. This training will be enhanced by the resource-rich environment and explicit support of student research and funding provided by the Pennsylvania State University, as well as the support of Dr. Kenneth Levy and his lab. This promising young researcher will gain training in computational modeling, proficiency in working with “big data,” increased understanding of conceptual and nosological models of BPD, and further skills in disseminating research findings through publication and presentation, as vital steps towards an independent research career in translational clinical science. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to elucidate the underlying psychopathology of borderline personality disorder (BPD), a prevalent, costly, and deadly psychiatric condition, through the identification of ecologically valid phenotypes of the disorder. Accurate identification of BPD phenotypes promises to reveal patterns of symptoms that can be targeted in treatment development, improving treatment effectiveness for this impairing disorder. This research will support scientifically and clinically useful algorithms for personalized intervention, enhancing treatment outcomes and reducing the overall burden of BPD.",Refining and Validating Borderline Personality Disorder Phenotypes Through Factor Mixture Modeling,9911299,F31MH121020,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Computer Models', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Factor Analysis', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupational', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Self Concept', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accomplished suicide', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data archive', 'effective therapy', 'flexibility', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'success', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIMH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,F31,2020,25358,-0.045964585739376694
"Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma Project Summary Childhood trauma dramatically increases the risk of adult psychiatric illness and significantly alters symptom complexity and treatment outcomes. Discovering causal factors and novel interventions could have a dramatic impact on treating psychiatric illness. Over the past decade, there has been a growing appreciation for the role of the gut microbiota in normal brain development and behavior and of critical modulatory effects of the gut microbiota on mental health. Interactions of microbiota with stress-related hormonal, immune, and inflammatory processes in the brain are particularly well supported. Thus, there is intense interest in understanding how interactions among stress, microbiome, and brain (the “stress-biome-brain” axis; SBB) contribute to a significant impact on mental health. We will address the hypothesis that adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. First, we will characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics in mice following recurrent trauma. Mice exposed to recurrent predation stress or to control conditions will be assessed for changes in the gut microbiota, hippocampal gene expression, and behavior. We will use these data to construct multi-level models and predict causal interactions among stress, microbiome, brain, and behavior. Next, we will test the hypothesis that changes in the gut microbiota induced by childhood trauma have causal effects in the brain. We will perform fecal transplants from trauma-exposed mice into naïve mice and measure changes in brain gene expression. These experiments will be performed in a germ-free mouse facility in mice with a small specified number of species, for precise control of microbial content. In addition, we will test strategies for perturbation of the microbial community and to assess behavioral outcomes in the germ-free facility. The data generated will set the stage for precision perturbation studies of the microbiota and its effects on behavior and for future translational studies. Project Narrative Adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome may contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. We will conduct experiments designed to characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics using state of the art genomics and systems biology. The results will provide a ranked list of the factors predicted to drive neuronal and behavioral responses across the system and will form the framework to test their causality.",Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma,9936242,R21MH118597,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early-life trauma', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predatory Behavior', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Trauma', 'Trauma recovery', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'comparative', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fecal transplantation', 'genome sciences', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'multilevel analysis', 'network models', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'synergism', 'translational study', 'trauma exposure', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2020,192828,0.017369245290822687
"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,9831645,R01MH114028,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Paraphilias', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Social Processes', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'aggression prevention', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data structure', 'early childhood', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'mental state', 'morphometry', 'multimodal data', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'pediatric trauma', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2020,698835,-0.006095376858791138
"Mental Health Research Network III Practice-based research has the potential to dramatically improve the speed, efficiency, relevance, and impact of mental health clinical and services research. Realizing those gains will require a practice-based research network capable of anticipating and adapting to changes in mental health care delivery, including: • Research fully embedded in real-world practice • Alignment of research goals with priorities of patient and health system stakeholders • Large-scale data infrastructure available for rapid analysis • A culture of trust and transparency to facilitate collaborative learning and improvement We propose to expand the existing Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) to include 14 research centers embedded in health systems serving a combined population of over 25 million patients in 16 states. MHRN infrastructure will be enhanced to support a next-generation practice-based network, including: • Increased engagement of patients, health system leaders, and other stakeholders in network governance • An expanded public, open-source library of software tools and other technical resources • More formal processes for conducting feasibility pilot projects and rapid response to stakeholder queries • Expanded outreach to external stakeholders and research partners This Overall application requests support for an Administrative Core, a Methods core, and four research projects. The Administrative Core will support all network activities, including ongoing affiliated research projects, new research projects proposed in this application, and new projects developed during the coming funding cycle. An Organizational Unit will include executive leadership, governance, strategic planning, and responsibility for financial management and regulatory compliance. An Outreach and External Collaboration Unit will be responsible for stakeholder engagement and developing collaborations with new research partners.

"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9994891,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multi-task learning', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,448068,-0.016313932531213455
"Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal responds to RFA-MH-17-612, “Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34).” We have shown in several randomized trials that family-focused therapy (FFT) for symptomatic youth at high-risk for bipolar disorder - consisting of psychoeducation and family communication and problem solving skills training - is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in hastening symptomatic recovery. However, between 50%-60% of high-risk youth still have residual mood symptoms and functional impairment after 18 weeks of FFT. In our prior studies, two constructs have emerged as predictors of lack of response to treatment: mood instability in the child and expressed emotion (EE) in parents (i.e., frequent critical comments or hostility). In adolescents (ages 12-18) with a parent with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, we hypothesize that augmenting FFT with frequent and targeted interventions in the home setting through a Smartphone app (MyCoachConnect, or MCC) will (a) have a greater and more rapid impact than standard FFT on the targeted mechanisms of mood instability in adolescents and EE in parents, and (b) as a result, enhance symptom resolution and functioning in adolescents. To be eligible, adolescents must score high on parent-rated measures of mood instability, and have at least one parent who is high-EE by speech sample coding criteria. The MCC app will record weekly open speech samples from parents and children and daily and weekly mood ratings from adolescents. The app assessments will be fed back to the FFT clinician, who will use this information to “push” recommendations for mood regulation, communication, and problem-solving strategies (linked to the FFT modules) for parents and youth. In year 1, we will conduct an open trial (n=25) to determine (a) the feasibility and acceptability of FFT with mobile coaching (FFT-MCC), as given by clinicians in community settings, and (b) associations between online/speech feature proxies of the targets (mood instability and EE as measured weekly by MCC) and standard measures of the targets. In years 2 and 3 we will conduct a 75- case RCT in which families are assigned to FFT with MCC skills coaching, FFT with MCC assessments only, with no coaching; or FFT Only, without MCC. We hypothesize that FFT-MCC will be acceptable to parents, adolescents and clinicians, and more effective than FFT without MCC coaching or FFT-Only in engaging the targets of mood instability and EE and promoting improvements in adolescents' mood symptoms and quality of life over 27 weeks. The study will facilitate the translation of a technological augmentation to an evidence-based family intervention, with the goal of increasing treatment access among families with mood disorders. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a 12-session evidence- based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC “real time” assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills. We hypothesize that the augmented version of FFT (FFT-MCC) will be more effective than FFT without coaching/informational alerts in altering treatment targets and in stabilizing youths' mood symptoms and quality of life.",Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders,9940913,R34MH117200,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Back', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Family', 'Family Relationship', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Hostility', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'community clinic', 'community setting', 'effectiveness trial', 'emerging adult', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'girls', 'high risk', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'mobile application', 'mood regulation', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'psychoeducation', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'skills training', 'smartphone Application', 'standard measure', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy design', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'usability', 'volunteer']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R34,2020,273000,-0.006988574399071079
"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology). The findings will yield novel classification approaches for negative symptom severity, may identify novel treatment targets (circuitry), and may yield classifications to stratify patients to treatment conditions.",ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits,9988505,R01MH121246,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Aphasia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Face', 'Factor Analysis', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Informatics', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychopathology', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Social Processes', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'computational platform', 'dimensional analysis', 'disability', 'druggable target', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient stratification', 'pleasure', 'quality assurance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'social', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'working group']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,932115,-0.00644696973959583
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center Project Summary/Abstract In its initial funding period, the ABCD consortium used a rigorous epidemiological approach to recruit a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10-year-olds through our 21 research sites, of which 2136 are twins or triplets. ABCD has created a comprehensive yet efficient protocol for participating youth and parents, using standardized and state-of-the-art methods for neuroimaging, biospecimens, and assessments of substance use, mental and physical health, neurocognition, culture, and environment, using a fully digital platform and making use of mobile technologies. We ensure cohesion and standardization by having employed a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC), which will: maintain and update the harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; perform rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay- derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state-of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; continue development of infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows; and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ABCD Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,878 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC) will maintain and update harmonized MRI protocols across sites and scanners, perform quality control of raw and derived data, and implement the informatics and computational infrastructure needed for the overall project.","ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center",9981957,U24DA041123,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caffeine', 'Calibration', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nicotine', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Social Functioning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Update', 'Youth', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'data archive', 'data dissemination', 'data exploration', 'data quality', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'handheld mobile device', 'health assessment', 'high standard', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'infrastructure development', 'mobile computing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'physical conditioning', 'recruit', 'retention rate', 'success', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'web portal']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2020,1020000,0.03540441626595752
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9979970,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'circadian', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social deficits', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,1261241,0.005902513950639222
"The Center for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NEUROMAP) Project Summary Mood and anxiety disorders will account for approximately $16 x 109 lost productivity or 25% of global GDP over the next 20 years. Eating disorders are among the deadliest psychiatric diseases and Anorexia Nervosa is two to three times more deadly than schizophrenia, bipolar and major depressive disorder. The Center for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NeuroMAP) aims to provide a (a) scientific, (b) operational, and (c) educational infrastructure for innovative neuroscience-based research to use individual differences on several biological levels together with sophisticated statistical approaches to generate clinically meaningful predictions of risk and outcomes for mood, anxiety, and eating disorders.

"Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents. PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Children and adolescents often grow up in the face of substantial developmental stress (i.e. trauma). While for some, this shifts the developmental trajectory to that of mental and general health disorders, others are resilient. Most research on developmental psychopathology is focused on risk while little is known on the mechanisms that confer resilience. The current study aims to identify biological (genomic, immune), psychological and cognitive mechanisms that underpin resilience in youth as defined by having low mood- anxiety and suicidal outcomes in youth with substantial developmental stress exposure (i.e. trauma and family history of depression). Elucidating resilience mechanisms has huge clinical implications as it will improve stratification of risk to develop depression and/or suicidal behavior, and could identify biological, psychological and cognitive targets that can inform development of future preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience, reducing the mental and general health adverse outcomes associated with childhood adversity. The study capitalizes on a large dataset of genotyped youths from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that have been comprehensively phenotyped for cognitive performance and psychopathology, and that reported substantial trauma exposure. The proposed research integrates genomic and cognitive data with clinical measures used to define resilience in cross sectional analysis of ~9500 PNC youths (Aim 1); incorporates longitudinal data of depression and suicide measures, pulled from electronic medical record in a subset of ~750 PNC youths (Aim 2); and relies on prospective data collection that includes immune profiling of selected PNC individuals to allow identification of immune signature of resilience (Aim 3). Integration of genomic with clinical, cognitive and immune data will allow predictive modeling, and Big Data driven analysis will allow identification of resilience mechanisms. The candidate is a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist physician scientist who is committed to translational research in youth at risk for psychiatric conditions. His overarching career goal is to develop methods for early identification of subclinical phenotypes before the onset of major psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression and suicide attempts) and, through neuroscience informed interventions, divert the developmental trajectory from that of risk to that of resilience. The career development plan capitalizes on a multidisciplinary mentorship team. It involves one-on one mentoring with the primary “clinical research” mentor as well as the genomic, biostatistical, neurocognitive and immune system expert co- mentors, integrated with hands on research supervision in data collection and statistical analysis, and didactic coursework and workshops. The program is tailored to meet research and training aims. The project will be conducted in the fostering environment of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, that will provide the academic mentorship and the required resources to execute the research and training aims, allowing the candidate to launch an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood adversities impose risk to general and mental health development, including youth depression and suicidal behavior, still most children are resilient. Through integration of genetic, clinical, cognitive and demographic data from research data and medical records, this study will identify mechanisms that underpin resilience in a generalizable large sample of community youth with substantial exposure to adversity. Understanding resilience mechanisms is a critical milestone on the mission to develop neuroscience informed preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience and reducing the health burden of early life adversity.",Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents.,9985197,K23MH120437,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Suicide attempt', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'child depression', 'childhood adversity', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'early life adversity', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'hands on research', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'research clinical testing', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'stress related disorder', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic stress']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K23,2020,193644,-0.009355950480102168
