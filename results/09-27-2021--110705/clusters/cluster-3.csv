"Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease ABSTRACT The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Elsie Ross, Assistant Professor of Surgery (Vascular Surgery) and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics Research) at Stanford University, the support necessary to transition her from a junior investigator into an independent surgeon-scientist in translational biomedical informatics. Dr. Ross is a vascular surgeon with an advanced degree in health services research and postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics. Her long-term goal is to combine her interdisciplinary training to develop and implement machine learning tools that will enable the delivery of precise, high-value care to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Her career development activities focus on advancing her ability to translate informatics discoveries into viable clinical tools by 1) completing didactic courses to deepen and expand her knowledge of deep learning algorithms, clinical trials and implementation science, 2) designing and conducting her first independent human subjects clinical research study evaluating the performance of machine learning technology, 3) implementing and evaluating the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based screening tool to identify latent vascular disease, and 4) strengthening her previous training in cost-effectiveness analysis to enable her future aim of evaluating the associated costs and utility of pro-active, automated disease screening. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr. Nigam Shah, a biomedical informatics expert who combines machine learning, text-mining and medical ontologies to enable a learning health care system; Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey a world-expert in cardiovascular clinical trials; and Dr. Paul Heidenreich, an expert in implementation sciences with a focus on the use of EHR interventions to improve care quality for cardiovascular patients and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new technologies. The research proposal builds on the candidate's prior work with using machine learning and EHR data to evaluate and predict cardiovascular disease outcomes. The candidate now proposes to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms in identifying patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) using EHR data (Aim 1), evaluate whether learned classification models perform better than traditional risk factors for identification of undiagnosed PAD in a prospective patient cohort (Aim 2), and implement an EHR-based screening tool to identify patients with undiagnosed PAD and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment effects (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will result in a novel, EHR-based screening tool for identification of undiagnosed vascular disease that can decrease PAD-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through earlier and more aggressive medical management. This research will also form the basis for an R01 application before the end of the award to conduct a multi-site randomized-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of EHR- based proactive PAD screening. ! ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease is a prevalent yet under-diagnosed condition that can lead to limb loss, stroke, heart attacks and/or premature death. Work proposed in this grant aims to develop technology using electronic health records and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify patients with undiagnosed peripheral artery disease and recommend treatment. Such technology could improve the health and longevity of patients with peripheral artery disease by ensuring that patients are diagnosed early and appropriately treated.",Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease,9806796,K01HL148639,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Current Procedural Terminology Codes', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care burden', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost outcomes', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'electronic data', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'human very old age (85+)', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'post-doctoral training', 'premature', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'randomized trial', 'recurrent neural network', 'research study', 'screening', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,162000,0.043639513379126964
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9610723,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,794994,0.036617967966110394
"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales. These methods are evaluated using public datasets to promote reproducibility, and applied to clinical research tasks that extend the knowledge of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital.",Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks,9642922,R01LM012973,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Face', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Rare Diseases', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Uncertainty', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'learning strategy', 'machine translation', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,386910,0.010301116675110277
"Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients Failure to rescue (FTR), a nurse-sensitive national metric of health care quality, refers to death of a hospitalized patient from a treatable complication, and is potentiated by failure to recognize and appropriately respond to early signs of complications. There is a paucity of research examining patient features predictive of FTR complications. Such information could shift the current paradigm of nursing surveillance to earlier recognition, prevention and treatment of FTR complications, thereby saving lives. New-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE), an FTR complication occurring as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable hospital death, carrying a high risk of mortality and a national cost burden of $7 billion annually. VTE is a complex disease process involving interactions between clinical risk factors and acquired and/or inherited susceptibilities to thrombosis. Although biomarkers and clinical factors associated with VTE have been identified, clinical manifestations are subtle, presenting gradually over hours to days. Current VTE risk assessment models (RAM), the cornerstone of prevention, have limited utility due to their complexity and lack of reliability, generalizability and external validation. A critical gap in VTE risk modeling research is that while new-onset VTE pathology evolves over the course of hospitalization, no current models incorporate the progressive accrual of dynamic patient data and pattern evolution over time in their modeling approaches. The totality of routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data is massive in terms of volume, variety, and production at a rapid velocity in real-time. Such big data could be used in machine learning (ML) analytic approaches to process time series clinical data to identify subtle, evolving feature patterns predictive of new-onset VTE and address this gap. This study proposes to assemble a large scale, multi-source, multi-dimensional VTE study dataset, and in tandem, systematically define the EHR data elements associated with a new-onset VTE diagnosis for computable phenotype algorithm development. We will then apply machine learning analytic approaches to baseline and accruing intensive time series clinical data in the curated dataset to develop models identifying data patterns and features predictive of dynamically evolving new-onset VTE in adult hospitalized patients. This proposal aligns with NINR’s strategic vision for nurse scientists to employ new strategies for collecting and analyzing complex big data sets to permit better understanding of the biological underpinnings of health, and improve ways nurses prevent and manage illness. This innovative study and individualized training plan under a strong and well- established team, represents initial steps in the applicant’s research trajectory focused on data science approaches to predict FTR complication risk, and develop, implement and test dynamic RAMs to inform targeted prevention and treatment decisions. Discovering new knowledge informing real-time decision making, nursing surveillance practices and care delivery systems can improve nurse sensitive patient outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death. This study first proposes to develop a reproducible computable phenotype definition for new-onset VTE cohort ascertainment from the electronic health record, and then develop dynamic models for VTE risk assessment through the application of machine learning algorithms to massive electronic health record clinical data repositories. Such models can inform the mechanisms underlying this complex disease and identify subtle pattern changes in a patient’s condition forecasting a VTE event, enabling earlier nurse identification and intervention, and decreasing the development of complications and failure to rescue in hospitalized patients.",Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients,9794015,F31NR018102,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Quality of Care', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Vision', 'base', 'care delivery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multidimensional data', 'prevent']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2019,45016,0.03839597894053447
"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,9637480,R01AG060993,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alabama', 'Algorithms', 'Ally', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational algorithm', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Staff', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'confusion assessment method', 'data mining', 'epidemiology study', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care settings', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phrases', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'ward']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2019,432969,0.0739880002663781
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9816009,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,502815,0.054733190635459276
"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms.

"Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes new methods for representing data in electronic health records (EHR) to improve pre- dictive modeling and interpretation of patient outcomes. EHR data offer a promising opportunity for advancing the understanding of how clinical decisions and patient conditions interact over time to inﬂuence patient health. However, EHR data are difﬁcult to use for predictive modeling due to the various data types they contain (con- tinuous, categorical, text, etc.), their longitudinal nature, the high amount of non-random missingness for certain measurements, and other concerns. Furthermore, patient outcomes often have heterogenous causes and re- quire information to be synthesized from several clinical lab measures and patient visits. The core challenge at hand is overcoming the mismatch between data representations in the EHR and the assumptions underly- ing commonly used statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. To this end, this project proposes novel wrapper-based methods for learning informative features from EHR data. Both methods propose specialized operators to handle sequential data, time delays, and variable interactions, and have the capacity to discover underlying clinical rules/decisions that affect patient outcomes. Importantly, both methods also produce archives of possible models that represent the best trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, which assists in model interpretation. These method advances are made possible by encoding a rich set of data operations as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, and optimizing the graph structures using multi-objective optimization. The central hypothesis of this research is that multi-objective optimization can learn effective data representations from the EHR to produce accurate, explanatory models of patient outcomes. Preliminary work has shown that these methods can effectively learn low-order data representations that improve the predictive ability of several state- of-the-art ML methods. This technique demonstrates good scaling properties with high-dimensional biomedical data. Aim 1 (K99) is to develop a multi-objective feature engineering method that pairs with existing ML methods to iteratively improve their performance by constructing new features from the raw data and using feedback from the trained model to guide feature construction. In Aim 2 (K99), this method is applied to form predictive models of the risk of heart disease and heart failure using longitudinal EHR data. The resultant models will be inter- preted with the help of mentors in order to translate predictions into clinical recommendations. For Aim 3 (R00), a second method is proposed that uses a similar framework to optimize existing neural network approaches in order to simplify their structure as much as possible while maintaining accuracy. The goal of Aim 4 (R00) is to identify hospital patients who are at risk of readmission and propose point-of-care strategies to mitigate that risk. This goal is facilitated through the application of the proposed methods to patient data collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Geisinger Health System, and publicly available EHR databases. Project Narrative  Understanding how clinical decisions interact with a patient's health and environmental over time to inﬂuence patient outcomes is central to the goals of enhancing health, reducing illness and improving quality of life. The proposed research provides important methodological advances for extracting these insights from widely available patient health records.",Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records,9744166,K99LM012926,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cluster computing', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder subtype', 'health record', 'heart disease risk', 'high dimensionality', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'readmission rates', 'readmission risk', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2019,89260,0.09991935119062566
"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The long-term goal of our ongoing project, “Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,” is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to understand and improve health. The EHR, because of its broad capture of human health, greatly amplifies our ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the strength of EHR data—its breadth and flexible nature—imposes additional challenges. We have found that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. We previously showed that health care process bias exists to the extent, for example, that simple use of the data can create signals implying the opposite of what we know to be true. One of the most important factors is sparse, irregular sampling; we found that sampling bias can be reduced by reparameterizing time and that prediction techniques that can accommodate EHR-specific data and resist their biases like data assimilation can be used on EHR data to produce good estimates of glucose and HA1c. The previous cycle of this project produced 75 publications. We propose to develop methods to accommodate health care process bias, using both knowledge engineering and experience with health care process bias as well as advanced statistical techniques that employ dynamical models and latent variables. We hypothesize that heuristics and models combined with knowledge can improve our ability to generate inferences and learn phenotypes despite health care process bias. Our aims are as follows: (1) Taking a knowledge engineering approach, study the effect of preprocessing and analytic choices on reducing health care process bias, and using machine learning techniques, learn more about health care process bias. (2) Taking a more empirical approach, use dynamic latent factor modeling and variation inference to accommodate health care process bias, learning how a patient's health state and health processes affect censoring, exploiting information from many variables at once. (3) Use data assimilation and mechanistic models to learn otherwise unmeasurable physiologic phenotypes despite irregular, sparse sampling typical of electronic health records. (4) Use the developed models and generated phenotypes to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project studies the biases that health care processes bring to electronic health record data, and it develops methods to overcome those biases to improve reuse of the data for purposes such as clinical research and quality improvement.",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,9659641,R01LM006910,"['Active Learning', 'Adopted', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Award', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Insulin', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Observational Study', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'clinical database', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,596772,0.08186977780340689
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes.

"An In Silico, Medical Record-based Model for Understanding the INitiation of Autoimmune Events (IMMUNE) Abstract More than 80% of cancer patients who undergo immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy experience immune related adverse events, including autoimmunity, following treatment. The etiology of autoimmune disease in humans is poorly understood and effective treatments are limited. Inbred mice are a valuable tool for understanding basic biological mechanisms of disease, but are less effective for understanding human autoimmunity. Therefore, it is critical to develop minimally invasive human models to provide real world insights into the mechanisms, development and therapy for autoimmunity. The widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) in healthcare and the depth of data collected for cancer patients, presents an important opportunity to identify risk factors for the development of autoimmune disease following immunotherapy. Our project brings together a team of immunologists, oncologists, informaticists and machine learning experts working within an EHR network, to identify a cohort of cancer patients who have undergone ICI therapy. From this cohort we will design and implement a broad and deep longitudinal database of EHR data, including treatment and response data and laboratory results, to enable the development of phenotypic profiles and models for autoimmune disease development in humans. The overarching goal of this project proposal is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of using a hybrid in silico / in vivo model system combined with machine learning strategies as a platform for understanding the etiology of autoimmune disease. In the R61 Phase we propose to identify patients who develop rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the in the presence or absence of cancer, and control cohort, using a physician-validated cohort of cancer patients and data from EHR, and use machine learning strategies to develop phenotypic profiles for RA in the presence or absence of cancer and ICI therapy. In the R33 Phase we will and develop and assess phenotypic profiles for global biomarkers tolerance disruption using machine learning and determine if family history is a predictor of the development of autoimmunity following ICI therapy. Our proposal, to develop an in silico based model for exploring the onset of autoimmunity, makes a leap forward for translational immunology and the exploration of mechanisms of human autoimmune disease development by leveraging the power of the information collected in EHR to predict outcomes. The phenotypic profiles developed could significantly accelerate precision medicine approaches for employing ICIs that minimize the potential autoimmune disease based on personal genetic, environmental and social information.

"2/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data.

"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes innovative intelligent biomedical natural language process approaches to detect ADEs in patients' electronic health records (EHRs), an important step towards ADE surveillance and pharmacovigilance. The focus of this proposal will bon the national priority area of anticoagulants ADE detection, although the algorithms and systems we develop can be extended to other drug classes and diseases. It is anticipated that the data resources, algorithms, and the Anticoagulant Pharmacovigilance Toolkit (APVTK) developed will significantly enhance ADE detection, patient surveillance and post marketing pharmacovigilance.",EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance,9628032,R01HL125089,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulant therapy', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Outcomes Research', 'Package Insert', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Reaction', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'data resource', 'disorder prevention', 'dosage', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'pharmacovigilance', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2019,809552,0.03802344381363509
"SCH: INT Re-envisioned Chat-assessment for Real-time Investigating of Nursing and Guidance  Two decades have lapsed since the seminal publications of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine), To Err Is Human and Crossing the Quality Chasm, cast a national spotlight on health-care safety and quality, yet US patient outcome indices continue to lag behind those in other industrialized countries. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act mandated health-care providers adopt electronic health record (EHR) systems, leading to widespread EHR adoption, albeit primarily for billing purposes rather than research or quality improvement efforts. Thus EHR impact on health-care quality has tended to be in the domains of physician efficiency and guideline compliance. Despite a large body of evidence that nursing quality is directly related to patient outcomes in the acute care selling, nurses often lack timely information to use in improving individual patient outcomes, and indices of outcomes across patient populations are slow to budge over lime. Widespread adoption of EHRs in U.S. hospitals now allows determination of outcome quality indicators for all patients in a hospital for real-time feedback to nurses. Quality indicators are often only determined by piecing together other information to determine occurrence of an incident, e.g., exhuming information buried in nursing notes. The goal is to develop Chart-assessment for Real-lime Investigation of Nursing and Guidance (CARING), an automated machine learning system to report and predict nursing quality indicators in real-time for hospitalized patients to assist nurses in care planning. CARI NG will reflect algorithmic innovations to mine sequential patterns from multi-sourced, heterogeneous data including nursing narratives, yielding robust predictive models that are insensitive to uncertain labels and evolve with changes in health-care practices. CARING will represent EHR data using inter-connected tensors, capturing higher-order relations, temporal weighting, i.e., more recent data receives more weight, and incorporating domain expert feedback in development. Although CARING will be developed initially for the ten hospitals of our industry partner Emory Healthcare, its flexible refinement will enable adaptation at other health-care institutions. Outcomes of this project will give nurses actionable data in real time to improve nursing care quality that they do not receive now. Moreover, this system can be implemented into the health information infrastructure at an institutional level, integrating multi-scale and multi-level clinical, contextual, and organizational data surrounding each patient for real-time reporting and incorporation into predictive models. CARING supports the National Library of Medicine mission 1) by creating an innovative open source suite of tools for advancing patient safety; and 2) through educational efforts: training graduate students and fellows, and developing a Massive Open Online Course (MOOG), ""Big Data Analytics for Nursing,"" covering topics at the confluence of computer science, nursing, and patient outcome quality indicators.

"Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD Project Summary This NHLBI K01 application supports the career development of Dr. Nrupen A. Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data.

"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research,9641499,R01MH118233,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data resource', 'delay sex', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'sex', 'support tools']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,855687,0.03791205516724481
"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study  average effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and benefit of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Specifically, under Aim 1, we will develop a unified framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reflect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efficient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide  sequential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus benefits when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing benefit to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efficient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient  population will be beneficial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

"2/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric diorders Abstract  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. In particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 25,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,200 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials. If individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be identified early, it might be possible to find more effective treatments for them.

"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The proposed research and career development plan are relevant to public health because health care- associated infections (HAIs) affect about one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $30 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. The objective of this project is to develop robust and portable automated surveillance toolkit that combines structured EHR data with rich information locked in clinical notes using natural language processing to identify HAIs after surgical procedures.

"Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics ABSTRACT Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgical procedure in the nation. Despite the high procedure volume, the evidence base for TJA procedures and associated interventions are limited. This is mainly due to lack of high quality data sources and the logistical difficulties associated with manually extracting TJA information from the unstructured text of the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of EHR and the advances in health information technology offer the potential to transform unstructured EHR notes into structured, codified format that can then be analyzed and shared with local and national arthroplasty registries and other agencies. We therefore propose to leverage unique data resources and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to build an informatics infrastructure for automated EHR data extraction and analysis. We will (1) develop a high performance, externally validated and user centric NLP- enabled algorithm for extraction of complex TJA-specific data elements from the structured and unstructured text of the EHR, (2) validate the algorithm externally in multiple EHR platforms and hospital settings, and (3) conduct a demonstration project focused on prediction of prosthetic joint infections using data elements collected by the NLP-enabled algorithm. Our overarching goal is to develop valid, open source and portable NLP-enabled data collection and risk prediction tools and disseminate them widely to hospitals participating in regional and national TJA registries. This research is significant as it leverages strong data resources and expertise to tackle the pressing need for high quality data and accurate prediction models in TJA. Automated data collection and processing capabilities will lead to an upsurge in secondary use of EHR to advance scientific knowledge on TJA risk factors, healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Accurate prediction of high risk patients for prosthetic joint infections will guide prevention and treatment decisions resulting in significant health benefits to TJA patients. The research is innovative because TJA-specific bioinformatics technology will shift TJA research from current under-powered, single-center studies to large, multi-center registry-based observational studies and clinical trials. Our deliverables have the potential to exert a sustained downstream effect on future TJA research, practice and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Lack of high quality data is a critical barrier to progress in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) research. We will utilize health information technology to automate extraction of rich TJA information from the electronic health records, and develop a robust risk prediction score for prosthetic joint infections, a devastating and yet preventable complication of TJA. Widespread adoption of these tools will enhance data collection capabilities and enable affordable large scale studies for practice improvements through secondary use of real-world data. Accurate prediction of post- operative infection risk among TJA candidates will guide individualized preventive strategies for modifiable risk factors, thereby reducing the burden of prosthetic joint infections in TJA patients.",Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics,9657648,R01AR073147,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guide prevention', 'Health Benefit', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'age group', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'joint infection', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'portability', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction model', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'willingness']",NIAMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,636882,0.03434632721759587
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear.

"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9774751,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'pharmacovigilance', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2019,600683,0.09988432300199372
"Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization Project summary Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health and criminal justice problem that negatively impacts millions of victims yearly in the United States, primarily women (85%). Most IPV-related healthcare visits (83%) occurred in an emergency department (ED), and these clinical encounters are unique opportunities to identify IPV victims and potentially provide assistance. Although numerous health professional organizations have endorsed universal screening and counseling for IPV since 1992, actual screening rates, detection of IPV victims, and referrals to IPV services remain low in the ED. As a result, many IPV victims pass through the ED unidentified and untreated. Computerized screening tools have been developed and implemented in clinical settings in order to assist providers in screening and detecting IPV. However, these tools have a great limitation in that they rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHR). Recently, researchers demonstrated that a history of IPV diagnoses and associated clinical symptoms highly predict current and future IPV (OR=7.8), and these important IPV data could serve as red flags that trigger providers to assess patients further for IPV. In order to enhance IPV screening in the ED, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summarizer that extracts, abstracts and synthesizes patient historical IPV data (structured and unstructured), and delivers patient historical IPV data to ED providers through an intuitive interface. The specific aims are: 1) develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) strategies to identify and extract patient historical IPV incidents and timelines from clinic notes; 2) develop and evaluate a web service-based summary tool (IPV-Summary-Service) that synthesizes patient- specific IPV information from both NLP-processed data elements and structured data; and 3) develop and pilot test an enhanced IPV screening strategy that delivers clinical evidence generated by the IPV-Summary- Service through a specific EHR (Epic) to providers during the patient universal IPV screening in the ED. This automatic clinical date summary for IPV will be piloted in one ED at MUSC. There are two major outcomes to be measured for the IPV-Summary enhanced screening for 6 months before and after the index date of pilot testing: 1) rate of successful referral to the IPV 24-hour dedicated IPV nurse; and 2) rate of initiation of referral and identification of persons at high risk of IPV. We will use mixed effect generalized linear regression models to estimate the effects of IPV-Summary on the referral rate and IPV case identification rate. Through survey studies, we will assess secondary outcomes including factors of system feasibility, usability, and providers' satisfaction. These analyses can identify potentially important correlates of the major outcomes and may help us improve the design of the intervention. The results from this study will form the foundation for a broader implementation in a regional health information exchange for EDs. Narrative Computer-based approaches for intimate partner violence (IPV) universal screening have led to significantly higher screening rate and detection rate, as well as receipt of IPV services in the emergency department (ED). However, these approaches rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal IPV data existing in electronic health records (EHR), which have high predictive power of IPV risk. In order to enhance the effectiveness of IPV screening, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summary tool that extracts, abstracts, and synthesizes patient historical IPV information from EHR and then delivers that critical information to ED providers at the point of care.",Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization,9739347,R21LM012945,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Event', 'Face', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Professional', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Violent injury', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'intimate partner violence', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability', 'web services']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2019,168188,0.04042907491730763
"Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology PROJECT SUMMARY Healthcare has changed rapidly in the last decade with the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) and the creation of national EHR-based data networks that aim to improve the quality of care. The American College of Rheumatology's RISE registry is a federally Qualified Clinical Data Registry that collects EHR data from the practices of almost 1000 rheumatologists nationally, analyzes these data centrally, and continuously feeds back performance on quality measures to practices via a web-based dashboard. In this K24 proposal, the applicant proposes to utilize novel methods in clinical informatics to increase the accuracy of quality measurement, while also developing and testing new EHR-based quality measures relevant to rheumatic diseases. The proposed research will leverage her strong research portfolio, including grants from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, her successful track record of achieving national endorsement for EHR-based quality measures, existing data from over 1.4 million patients in the RISE database, and the outstanding institutional environment at the University of California, San Francisco. It will also support her ongoing career development in clinical informatics methods relevant to EHR-based clinical research. For this five year K24 award proposal, she plans to increase the time spent mentoring junior investigators in the field or quality and outcomes measurement in rheumatology, with the goal of helping trainees successfully launch academic research careers in patient- oriented research. Aligned with a comprehensive mentoring plan, the proposal outlines two specific aims, including using natural language processing to increase the accuracy of EHR-based quality measurement in RISE, and developing and validating new, prototype electronic clinical quality measures to monitor and address high impact gaps in care for patients with rheumatic disease. The work will prioritize outcome measures and use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model and Health Quality Measures Format to develop, specify and test measures. Measures developed through this research and mentoring program will be candidates for nationwide dissemination across rheumatology practices to improve care for individuals with rheumatic disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This mid-career investigator award will support a program in patient-oriented research in rheumatic diseases at the University of California, San Francisco. The award will allow the applicant to expand her research on the development and validation of health care quality measures and support her mentoring of early investigators.

"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions Project Summary  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) are morbid immunologic reactions to drugs that confer a mortality of 10-50%. Over the last decade, significant promise for prediction and prevention has come from the discovery that many SCARs are associated with variation within HLA class I alleles. For HLA-B*15:02, this has led to routine pre-prescription screening for carbamazepine in many Southeast Asian countries and a significant reduction in cases of carbamazepine SJS/TEN. Despite this progress, there is little known about genetic and epidemiological risk factors for SCARs related to commonly used drugs such as antibiotics. There is also limited information about HLA risk for SCARs across the diverse populations present in the United States. Furthermore, imprecision of clinical phenotyping and lack of standardized coding has led to challenges in finding SCAR cases in the electronic health record (EHR). Our proposed study aims to address critical challenges and gaps in our knowledge of antibiotic SCARs.  In Aim 1, we will leverage advanced informatics and longitudinal EHR data for over 11 million patients from Partners HealthCare System since the 1980s to identify SCAR cases. We will create, optimize and standardize reproducible methods for finding SCAR cases and validating a cohort of SCAR patients. This iterative process will be used to refine and disseminate an electronic phenotype to be validated cross-institutionally.  In Aim 2, we will analyze SCAR prevalence and conduct a case-control study to identify drug-specific and patient-specific risk factors for antibiotic-associated SCARs. We will compare clinical sequelae, quality of life and adherence of SCAR patients compared to controls through validated survey instruments.  In Aim 3, we will identify candidate HLA and genetic associations from patients with validated antibiotic- associated SCARs. We will examine difference in genetic risk in minority and health disparity populations and predict that we will be powered to establish HLA associations for vancomycin DRESS (i.e., drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) and sulfonamide antimicrobial and beta-lactam SCAR. HLA alone, or in combination with clinical risk factors, can lead to improved SCAR prevention and early diagnosis. We will establish a data sharing platform, in the form of an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.  The roadmap we develop will translate into the development of electronic phenotypes for serious adverse drug reactions that facilitate genetic discovery. Knowledge gained will be crucial to the translation of genetic data into clinical decision making. This is in close alignment with NIH’s research mission to accelerate genetic discovery for iatrogenic and preventable drug-induced diseases that will translate into prevention, earlier diagnosis and an enhanced mechanistic understanding that may lead to targeted therapeutic approaches. Narrative  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) result in substantial morbidity, long term disability, health care burden and a mortality of 10-50%. To advance the science of clinical and genetic risk factor identification for antibiotic SCAR, we will leverage large electronic health record (EHR) data and advanced informatics technology. Through case validation we will create an informatics roadmap for other institutions with similar EHR data to identify SCAR cases and we will establish a data sharing platform, including an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.",Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions,9857829,R01AI150295,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Allopurinol', 'Antibiotics', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biological Markers', 'Carbamazepine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Country', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Administration Routes', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eosinophilia', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Female', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monobactams', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nevirapine', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Sulfonamides', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin', 'Variant', 'abacavir', 'adverse drug reaction', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'care burden', 'case control', 'case finding', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'health disparity', 'immunoreaction', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'sex', 'southeast Asian', 'targeted treatment']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,689571,0.050659762788626286
"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9747390,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individual response', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'patient response', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,298872,0.040023372740563765

"National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms PROJECT SUMMARY With the rapidly growing adoption of patient electronic health record systems (EHRs) due to Meaningful Use, and linkage of EHRs to research biorepositories, evaluating the suitability of EHR data for clinical and translational research is becoming ever more important, with ramifications for genomic and observational research, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness studies. A key component for identifying patient cohorts in the EHR is to define inclusion and exclusion criteria that algorithmically select sets of patients based on stored clinical data. This process is commonly referred to, as “EHR-driven phenotyping” is time-consuming and tedious due to the lack of a widely accepted and standards-based formal information model for defining phenotyping algorithms. To address this overall challenge, the proposed project will design, build and promote an open-access community infrastructure for standards-based development and sharing of phenotyping algorithms, as well as provide tools and resources for investigators, researchers and their informatics support staff to implement and execute the algorithms on native EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of patient cohorts for clinical and genomic research is a costly and time-consuming process. This bottleneck adversely affects public health by delaying research findings, and in some cases by making research costs prohibitively high. To address this issue, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) for identifying patient cohorts has become an increasingly attractive option. This proposal will investigate and implement standards based approaches for computable phenotype identification from multiple EHRs.",National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms,9774075,R01GM105688,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Flowcharts', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Logic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Needs Assessment', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'University Hospitals', 'authority', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'database query', 'deep learning', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics training', 'information model', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'repository', 'syntax', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,706851,0.12306983346971986
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9749154,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,178606,0.05831096811949313
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients.

"Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data PROJECT SUMMARY Large electronic health record research (EHR) data integrated with -omics data from linked biorepositories have expanded opportunities for precision medicine research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized cancer risk and progression prediction models, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice and ultimately realize the promise of precision oncology. However, efficiently and effectively using EHR for cancer research remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, obtaining precise event time information such as time of cancer recurrence is a major bottleneck in using EHR for precision medicine research due to the requirement of laborious medical record review and the lack of documentation. Simple estimates of the event time based on billing or procedure codes may poorly approximate the true event time. Naive use of such estimated event times can lead to highly biased estimates due to the approximation error. Such biases impose challenges to performing pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time to events and captured using EHR. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill these methodological gaps in risk assessment for cancer research using EHR data, which will advance our ability to achieve the promise of precision oncology. Statistical algorithms and software will be developed to (i) automatically assign event time information using longitudinally recorded EHR information; and (ii) to perform accurate risk assessment using noisy proxies of event times. The proposed tools for risk assessment using imperfect EHR data without requiring extensive manual chart review could greatly improve the utility of EHR for oncology research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses major methodological gaps in effectively utilizing EHR data for risk assessment due to the noisy nature of EHR data. We propose novel statistical algorithms and software to (i) efficiently annotate event time by combining multiple longitudinally recorded code information and (ii) to provide precise risk estimates using noisy proxies of event times. By drawing upon the rich albeit imperfect data from bio-repository linked EHR, our algorithms will advance our ability to use EHR data for precision oncology research.",Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data,9827744,R21CA242940,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Boston', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proxy', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'adjudicate', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2019,192385,0.12208533676541097
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9442890,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,794994,0.036617967966110394
"Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients Failure to rescue (FTR), a nurse-sensitive national metric of health care quality, refers to death of a hospitalized patient from a treatable complication, and is potentiated by failure to recognize and appropriately respond to early signs of complications. There is a paucity of research examining patient features predictive of FTR complications. Such information could shift the current paradigm of nursing surveillance to earlier recognition, prevention and treatment of FTR complications, thereby saving lives. New-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE), an FTR complication occurring as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable hospital death, carrying a high risk of mortality and a national cost burden of $7 billion annually. VTE is a complex disease process involving interactions between clinical risk factors and acquired and/or inherited susceptibilities to thrombosis. Although biomarkers and clinical factors associated with VTE have been identified, clinical manifestations are subtle, presenting gradually over hours to days. Current VTE risk assessment models (RAM), the cornerstone of prevention, have limited utility due to their complexity and lack of reliability, generalizability and external validation. A critical gap in VTE risk modeling research is that while new-onset VTE pathology evolves over the course of hospitalization, no current models incorporate the progressive accrual of dynamic patient data and pattern evolution over time in their modeling approaches. The totality of routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data is massive in terms of volume, variety, and production at a rapid velocity in real-time. Such big data could be used in machine learning (ML) analytic approaches to process time series clinical data to identify subtle, evolving feature patterns predictive of new-onset VTE and address this gap. This study proposes to assemble a large scale, multi-source, multi-dimensional VTE study dataset, and in tandem, systematically define the EHR data elements associated with a new-onset VTE diagnosis for computable phenotype algorithm development. We will then apply machine learning analytic approaches to baseline and accruing intensive time series clinical data in the curated dataset to develop models identifying data patterns and features predictive of dynamically evolving new-onset VTE in adult hospitalized patients. This proposal aligns with NINR’s strategic vision for nurse scientists to employ new strategies for collecting and analyzing complex big data sets to permit better understanding of the biological underpinnings of health, and improve ways nurses prevent and manage illness. This innovative study and individualized training plan under a strong and well- established team, represents initial steps in the applicant’s research trajectory focused on data science approaches to predict FTR complication risk, and develop, implement and test dynamic RAMs to inform targeted prevention and treatment decisions. Discovering new knowledge informing real-time decision making, nursing surveillance practices and care delivery systems can improve nurse sensitive patient outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death. This study first proposes to develop a reproducible computable phenotype definition for new-onset VTE cohort ascertainment from the electronic health record, and then develop dynamic models for VTE risk assessment through the application of machine learning algorithms to massive electronic health record clinical data repositories. Such models can inform the mechanisms underlying this complex disease and identify subtle pattern changes in a patient’s condition forecasting a VTE event, enabling earlier nurse identification and intervention, and decreasing the development of complications and failure to rescue in hospitalized patients.",Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients,9610301,F31NR018102,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Quality of Care', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Vision', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'prevent']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2018,44524,0.03839597894053447
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9522037,R01GM097618,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Coxibs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'synergism']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,536041,0.029419137156922744
"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance.

"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,9504168,K99NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2018,90050,-0.01202633374998072

"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9479293,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'patient portal', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2018,248999,0.04523280543365918
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes.

"Algorithms to Identify Systemic Lupus from Electronic Health Record Data Abstract  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that is often difficult to diagnose because of the diverse manifestations that occur over time and across care sites leading to increased damage and early mortality. The personal and economic costs in decreased quality of life and increase in healthcare expenditures, respectively, highlight the critical unmet need to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat lupus, so that treatment or participation in clinical trials occurs as early as possible to mitigate against disease-related damage. Therefore, it is important to find better ways to identify SLE patents.  Electronic health records (EHR) are now used in a majority of health care settings throughout the country, and present a rich source of information about patients which can be mined for earlier diagnosis and identification to improve quality of care, or enable high throughput clinical studies. Despite this potential, to date few accurate algorithms have been developed to identify SLE patients using EHR data. Construction of an effective algorithm, either by rule-based or machine learning methods, requires access to at two data resources not commonly available: 1) a validated “gold standard” patient data set with clear documentation of criteria that are indicative of SLE that can be compared against EHR data and 2) an integrated health record dataset that contains data from multiple health care institutions and reflects that SLE patients receive healthcare at multiple institutions and healthcare providers given their chronic, progressive disease. Over the past several years, our team has created both key resources: the Chicago Lupus Database (CLD), a physician-validated registry of 880 patients and gold standard data set and the Chicago HealthLNK Data Repository (HDR), a regional data resource including integrated medical records for 2.1 million patients across multiple institutions. Jointly, these two datasets enable the creation, testing and validation of algorithms for the identification of SLE in EHR data and provide a more complete picture of a patient population at risk for lupus.  We propose three specific aims to address the need to reduce the time to identify those with SLE in order to initiate treatment in a timelier fashion and to identify candidates for clinical trials. These aims are: 1) To create and validate a series of algorithms to identify SLE patients in EHR data against a gold standard curated registry, CLD, using validated classification criteria for SLE to build concepts for rule-based and machine learning methods that incorporate structured data, laboratory data, and unstructured data, e.g., physician notes, 2) To determine whether identification of SLE patients is improved when algorithms to identify SLE patients are extended to an integrated medical record dataset that includes data from multiple health care institutions, and 3) To use clustering techniques on SLE patients identified from EHR data to isolate clinically distinct sub-populations of patients, which could inform patient selection for participation in clinical trials.

Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD.

"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study av- erage effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and beneﬁt of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Speciﬁcally, under Aim 1, we will develop a uniﬁed framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reﬂect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efﬁcient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide se- quential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus beneﬁts when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing beneﬁt to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efﬁcient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient pop- ulation will be beneﬁcial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

"Improving accreditation, certification and quality improvement programs through automated abstraction of electronic health data. ABSTRACT SBIR Phase I: Reduce the burden of data abstraction for certification, accreditation and quality improvement programs via a new platform to automate the abstraction of measures and a novel interface to improve human abstractor workflow. The broad impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is to drive down the burden of participation in quality improvement programs, specifically, the resource intensive manual data abstraction process to derive and report quality measures that are instrumental to improving health outcomes and controlling costs. Patient Insight proposes improvements through automated abstraction methods and an interface for human abstractors to better visualize electronic health record (EHR) data and complete their work. The existing approach is a barrier to broader uptake of quality improvement initiatives such as accreditation. Patient Insight’s proposed solution consists of leveraging both proven and proprietary technologies to extract data via EHR agnostic application programming interfaces (APIs), better target eligible patients, and calculate measures via natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and custom queries. The core innovation is a novel data mining engine and user interface that improves the process of human data abstraction for clinical and quality documentation such as those required to achieve accreditation. The proposed project will allow Patient Insight, in partnership with the American College of Cardiology, a leader in the hospital based accreditation space, to develop a proof-of-concept pilot project at a select hospital and compare human and automated data abstraction methods for a pre-selected number of measures that are mandated as part of the ACC’s Heart Failure Accreditation program. Once completed, Patient Insight will expand on the technology, design and user research data/requirements with a roadmap for product enhancements for Phase II that will enable the building of a commercially viable ‘add-on’ service for sites participating in the ACC’s suite of accreditation programs and eventually expand to additional ACC service lines as well as other accreditation and certifying bodies. Success will represent a transformative change in general-purpose abstraction and an interface that will support a broad array of accreditation measures and abstraction workflows thereby solving a critical inefficiency both clinically and financially for hospitals while improving patient health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Health service accreditation and certification programs are a critical mechanism to direct care quality improvements and ensure compliance with regulations. Reporting on requisite measures is a resource intensive and costly process requiring human data abstractors to interpret heterogeneous and disparately presented data elements from the electronic health record (EHR). Replacing human elements using evolving automated data abstraction methods and an interface for abstractors to better visualize EHR data and manage their workflow would solve an important, unmet need and offer a dramatic improvement over the status quo. Patient Insight’s commercial technology solution will facilitate efficiencies in automated data abstraction and human-to-computer interactions in quality improvement reporting.","Improving accreditation, certification and quality improvement programs through automated abstraction of electronic health data.",9622944,R43LM012955,"['Accreditation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Budgets', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Cost Control', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Diuretics', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Technology', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cardiology service', 'certificate program', 'college', 'cost', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'exercise program', 'follow-up', 'health assessment', 'health data', 'human data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'new technology', 'novel', 'product development', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'success', 'tool', 'uptake', 'usability']",NLM,"PATIENT INSIGHT, INC.",R43,2018,259060,0.03936367553357759
"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award.

"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9534182,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient-clinician communication', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2018,335217,0.10447425873906727
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort - Diversity Supplement Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear.

"Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics ABSTRACT Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgical procedure in the nation. Despite the high procedure volume, the evidence base for TJA procedures and associated interventions are limited. This is mainly due to lack of high quality data sources and the logistical difficulties associated with manually extracting TJA information from the unstructured text of the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of EHR and the advances in health information technology offer the potential to transform unstructured EHR notes into structured, codified format that can then be analyzed and shared with local and national arthroplasty registries and other agencies. We therefore propose to leverage unique data resources and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to build an informatics infrastructure for automated EHR data extraction and analysis. We will (1) develop a high performance, externally validated and user centric NLP- enabled algorithm for extraction of complex TJA-specific data elements from the structured and unstructured text of the EHR, (2) validate the algorithm externally in multiple EHR platforms and hospital settings, and (3) conduct a demonstration project focused on prediction of prosthetic joint infections using data elements collected by the NLP-enabled algorithm. Our overarching goal is to develop valid, open source and portable NLP-enabled data collection and risk prediction tools and disseminate them widely to hospitals participating in regional and national TJA registries. This research is significant as it leverages strong data resources and expertise to tackle the pressing need for high quality data and accurate prediction models in TJA. Automated data collection and processing capabilities will lead to an upsurge in secondary use of EHR to advance scientific knowledge on TJA risk factors, healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Accurate prediction of high risk patients for prosthetic joint infections will guide prevention and treatment decisions resulting in significant health benefits to TJA patients. The research is innovative because TJA-specific bioinformatics technology will shift TJA research from current under-powered, single-center studies to large, multi-center registry-based observational studies and clinical trials. Our deliverables have the potential to exert a sustained downstream effect on future TJA research, practice and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Lack of high quality data is a critical barrier to progress in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) research. We will utilize health information technology to automate extraction of rich TJA information from the electronic health records, and develop a robust risk prediction score for prosthetic joint infections, a devastating and yet preventable complication of TJA. Widespread adoption of these tools will enhance data collection capabilities and enable affordable large scale studies for practice improvements through secondary use of real-world data. Accurate prediction of post- operative infection risk among TJA candidates will guide individualized preventive strategies for modifiable risk factors, thereby reducing the burden of prosthetic joint infections in TJA patients.",Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics,9486584,R01AR073147,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guide prevention', 'Health Benefit', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'age group', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'joint infection', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'portability', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'willingness']",NIAMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,484387,0.03434632721759587
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects.

"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research.

"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized.

"Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization Project summary Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health and criminal justice problem that negatively impacts millions of victims yearly in the United States, primarily women (85%). Most IPV-related healthcare visits (83%) occurred in an emergency department (ED), and these clinical encounters are unique opportunities to identify IPV victims and potentially provide assistance. Although numerous health professional organizations have endorsed universal screening and counseling for IPV since 1992, actual screening rates, detection of IPV victims, and referrals to IPV services remain low in the ED. As a result, many IPV victims pass through the ED unidentified and untreated. Computerized screening tools have been developed and implemented in clinical settings in order to assist providers in screening and detecting IPV. However, these tools have a great limitation in that they rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHR). Recently, researchers demonstrated that a history of IPV diagnoses and associated clinical symptoms highly predict current and future IPV (OR=7.8), and these important IPV data could serve as red flags that trigger providers to assess patients further for IPV. In order to enhance IPV screening in the ED, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summarizer that extracts, abstracts and synthesizes patient historical IPV data (structured and unstructured), and delivers patient historical IPV data to ED providers through an intuitive interface. The specific aims are: 1) develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) strategies to identify and extract patient historical IPV incidents and timelines from clinic notes; 2) develop and evaluate a web service-based summary tool (IPV-Summary-Service) that synthesizes patient- specific IPV information from both NLP-processed data elements and structured data; and 3) develop and pilot test an enhanced IPV screening strategy that delivers clinical evidence generated by the IPV-Summary- Service through a specific EHR (Epic) to providers during the patient universal IPV screening in the ED. This automatic clinical date summary for IPV will be piloted in one ED at MUSC. There are two major outcomes to be measured for the IPV-Summary enhanced screening for 6 months before and after the index date of pilot testing: 1) rate of successful referral to the IPV 24-hour dedicated IPV nurse; and 2) rate of initiation of referral and identification of persons at high risk of IPV. We will use mixed effect generalized linear regression models to estimate the effects of IPV-Summary on the referral rate and IPV case identification rate. Through survey studies, we will assess secondary outcomes including factors of system feasibility, usability, and providers' satisfaction. These analyses can identify potentially important correlates of the major outcomes and may help us improve the design of the intervention. The results from this study will form the foundation for a broader implementation in a regional health information exchange for EDs. Narrative Computer-based approaches for intimate partner violence (IPV) universal screening have led to significantly higher screening rate and detection rate, as well as receipt of IPV services in the emergency department (ED). However, these approaches rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal IPV data existing in electronic health records (EHR), which have high predictive power of IPV risk. In order to enhance the effectiveness of IPV screening, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summary tool that extracts, abstracts, and synthesizes patient historical IPV information from EHR and then delivers that critical information to ED providers at the point of care.",Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization,9520862,R21LM012945,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Event', 'Face', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Professional', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Violent injury', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'intimate partner violence', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability', 'web services']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2018,201825,0.04042907491730763
"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9509579,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individual response', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'patient response', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,344656,0.040023372740563765

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9537252,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,178606,0.05831096811949313
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients.

"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9323511,R01GM097618,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Coxibs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'synergism']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,536041,0.029419137156922744
"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 06/09) Page Continuation Format Page PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes innovative intelligent biomedical natural language process approaches to detect ADEs in patients' electronic health records (EHRs), an important step towards ADE surveillance and pharmacovigilance. The focus of this proposal will bon the national priority area of anticoagulants ADE detection, although the algorithms and systems we develop can be extended to other drug classes and diseases.

"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9254613,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2017,248999,0.04523280543365918
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes.

"Algorithms to Identify Systemic Lupus from Electronic Health Record Data Abstract  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that is often difficult to diagnose because of the diverse manifestations that occur over time and across care sites leading to increased damage and early mortality. The personal and economic costs in decreased quality of life and increase in healthcare expenditures, respectively, highlight the critical unmet need to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat lupus, so that treatment or participation in clinical trials occurs as early as possible to mitigate against disease-related damage. Therefore, it is important to find better ways to identify SLE patents.  Electronic health records (EHR) are now used in a majority of health care settings throughout the country, and present a rich source of information about patients which can be mined for earlier diagnosis and identification to improve quality of care, or enable high throughput clinical studies. Despite this potential, to date few accurate algorithms have been developed to identify SLE patients using EHR data. Construction of an effective algorithm, either by rule-based or machine learning methods, requires access to at two data resources not commonly available: 1) a validated “gold standard” patient data set with clear documentation of criteria that are indicative of SLE that can be compared against EHR data and 2) an integrated health record dataset that contains data from multiple health care institutions and reflects that SLE patients receive healthcare at multiple institutions and healthcare providers given their chronic, progressive disease. Over the past several years, our team has created both key resources: the Chicago Lupus Database (CLD), a physician-validated registry of 880 patients and gold standard data set and the Chicago HealthLNK Data Repository (HDR), a regional data resource including integrated medical records for 2.1 million patients across multiple institutions. Jointly, these two datasets enable the creation, testing and validation of algorithms for the identification of SLE in EHR data and provide a more complete picture of a patient population at risk for lupus.  We propose three specific aims to address the need to reduce the time to identify those with SLE in order to initiate treatment in a timelier fashion and to identify candidates for clinical trials. These aims are: 1) To create and validate a series of algorithms to identify SLE patients in EHR data against a gold standard curated registry, CLD, using validated classification criteria for SLE to build concepts for rule-based and machine learning methods that incorporate structured data, laboratory data, and unstructured data, e.g., physician notes, 2) To determine whether identification of SLE patients is improved when algorithms to identify SLE patients are extended to an integrated medical record dataset that includes data from multiple health care institutions, and 3) To use clustering techniques on SLE patients identified from EHR data to isolate clinically distinct sub-populations of patients, which could inform patient selection for participation in clinical trials.

"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in is infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems. As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,9332474,R01LM010207,"['Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Interruption', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data access', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward', 'web portal']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,341475,0.08140333962691239
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,9324206,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Preventive measure', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2017,156686,0.020901352121684272
"Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity is associated with high financial cost and increased morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Health care spending due to obesity is estimated to be as high as \$210 billion annually, or 21\% of total national spending. A childhood obesity surveillance system will discern disparities, detect aberrant signals, design targeted interventions, and track change over time. In addition to national public health surveillance systems, local data are increasingly necessary to reflect regional trends. Current systems in Wisconsin are subject to (1) bias estimation of obesity rates, (2) limited data in school-aged children ages 5-10 years, (3) insufficient power to estimate disparities in local subgroups, and (4) limited ability to track local changes over time. Therefore, the impact of investments and collective efforts in Wisconsin childhood obesity prevention has been difficult to measure. This, in turn, demands approaches that overcome and transcend the posited limitations. Since large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, there has been a paradigm shift and accelerated improvements in the use of EHR data for the purpose of population health promotion and tracking of progress. The University of Wisconsin Population Health Information Exchange (PHINEX) database contains de- identified EHR data from a multicenter healthcare system located primarily in south central Wisconsin. In partnership with The Wisconsin Obesity Prevention Initiative, we aim to create an EHR model for a childhood obesity prevention surveillance system. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods using the platform of PHINEX for childhood obesity prevention purposes. This enhance and extend surveillance activities of childhood obesity conditions, and increase the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions aimed at changing policies, systems, and environments associated with childhood obesity. We plan to address the following aims: (1) robust estimation of the spatiotemporal prevalence at area level, (2) hot spot detection on areas with aberrant obesity incidence, and (3) prediction for childhood weight gain phenotypes. The developed and implemented surveillance system can benefit future planning, legislation and implementation in other states and/or surveillance of other acute and chronic health conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood obesity has emerged as a leading health concern in the 21st century. Current data sources from which childhood obesity estimates are derived in most systems are primarily cross-sectional, are from small sample sizes, and/or have limited generalizability. Large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, which provide unprecedented opportunities for individual and population health surveillance. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods to increase the use of large EHR data for childhood obesity prevention purposes, extending the scope of public health surveillance.",Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data,9328110,R21HD086754,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family Practice', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hot Spot', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Municipalities', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'School-Age Population', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smiling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'population based', 'population health', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'user friendly software']",NICHD,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R21,2017,259287,0.04586608627557981
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9332464,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,335217,0.10447425873906727
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2 million patients at Vanderbilt (including 10,000 genotyped statin recipients) to answer these questions.",Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort,9309793,R01HL133786,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Breast', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataract', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Colorectal', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prostate', 'Qi', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer risk', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'glutaryl coA', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,406123,0.05045943818393119
"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values. This work aims to improve our ability to extract useful information from electronic health records to enable disease subtyping, particularly in the area of mental health.",Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records,9453180,K01LM012529,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatology', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response', 'treatment response']",NLM,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,189054,0.021027947442514638
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research.

"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9358350,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,344715,0.040023372740563765
"Novel Informatics Approaches for Ascertainment of PAD Status and Adverse Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant and principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified cardiologist, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Senior Associate Consultant in the Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Division. [The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator in translational informatics focused on the development, validation and deployment of electronic tools to the point-of-care to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. The PI intends to leverage the EHR to conduct population-based studies using electronic algorithms that include NLP and by application of state-of-the-art informatics approaches to deliver the knowledge at the point-of-care in support of patient-centered decision-making for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The electronic tools developed will be portable to different institutions and other health conditions. The PI will be uniquely positioned as a cardiologist within a large academic health system working with novel NLP techniques at the interface of the EHR and CDS to rapidly translate knowledge acquired in community-based epidemiologic investigations to patient care.] The PI has proposed a research career development plan to acquire expertise in translational informatics including electronic phenotyping, and automated calculation and visual display of prognostic scores using a novel application integrated with clinical decision support (CDS). The PI will complete comprehensive coursework in informatics science and gain additional patient-oriented and epidemiologic research experience. The primary mentor will be Iftikhar Kullo, M.D., cardiologist and PI of the Mayo Clinic electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) network and a leader in the development and application of electronic phenotyping for genomic studies of PAD. The mentoring team also includes Dr. Christopher Chute, M.D., Head of Medical Informatics at Mayo Clinic, an expert in informatics and epidemiology, and co-PI of the Mayo eMERGE grant and co-investigator of the Rochester Epidemiology Project; Hongfang Liu, Ph.D., an expert in natural language processing (NLP) and its application for EHR-based phenotyping; and Kent Bailey, Ph.D., senior biostatistician with expertise in development of prognostic risk scores. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1 - Apply phenotyping algorithms that include NLP of clinical notes to [a] identify PAD cases and controls without PAD in the community from 1998-2011; and [b] ascertain adverse cardiovascular and limb outcomes through December 2013. Aim 2 - Create multivariable prognostic risk models and scores for adverse outcomes in PAD cases from the community. We will estimate the relative risk of death in PAD patients compared to controls without PAD. Aim 3 - Develop and evaluate usefulness of a novel electronic application within the Mayo EHR to retrieve relevant data elements, calculate, and display individualized prognostic scores. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and an e-health prognostication tool for PAD patients to be disseminated to stakeholders including clinicians, patients, and researchers portable to other institutions and other cardiovascular diseases.

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9325317,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,178606,0.05831096811949313
"NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department Summary Timely identification of relevant or “need to know” clinical information about a patient’s history in the acute care setting can be critical for patient safety and medical decision-making. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. Currently, it is estimated that over 50% of the EHR is free-text. EHR search tools today are often inefficient, simplistic, and unable to rank or evoke the relevance of information for a particular problem or complaint. This is compounded by the fact that EHRs are amassing clinical information at an exponential rate. While the benefits of having a wealth of information at a provider’s fingertips seem obvious, the time and energy cost of culling through enormous amounts of data creates new issues of decreased efficiency and information overload for providers seeking to identify the most pertinent and relevant information about their patients. In the emergency department, where patients can present with life threatening conditions, timely unlocking of clinically relevant information for a patient’s problem or complaint at the point of care can be critical to medical decision-making and patient safety. In this study, we plan to address this challenge through the development of a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information based on the patients presenting complaint. We will accomplish this through the following specific aims: 1) identify and define complaint- specific information elements within a patient’s history and 2) develop and test an NLP-based information retrieval tool. Narrative Patient safety hinges on having right information about the right patient and the right time. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information from EHRs that providers rely upon to make medical decisions for their patients. This study comes at an important time where data in the EHRs is increasing at an exponential rate, creating a new problem for clinicians, that of finding all the relevant information for patient’s particular problem. This is particularly true in the emergency department setting where providers have limited if any prior relationship and often have to make quick decisions for patients with life threatening conditions. This search tool will provide a snapshot of clinically relevant information that the providers can view alongside the structured information already in the EHR. We believe this approach has the potential to increase clinician efficiency, decrease healthcare costs by avoiding duplicate diagnostic tests, and provide clinicians with the tools they need to make well-informed medical decisions, thereby improving patient safety and reducing suffering.",NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department,9342692,R21HS024541,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2017,148922,0.0016608930031206735
"National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms PROJECT SUMMARY With the rapidly growing adoption of patient electronic health record systems (EHRs) due to Meaningful Use, and linkage of EHRs to research biorepositories, evaluating the suitability of EHR data for clinical and translational research is becoming ever more important, with ramifications for genomic and observational research, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness studies. A key component for identifying patient cohorts in the EHR is to define inclusion and exclusion criteria that algorithmically select sets of patients based on stored clinical data. This process is commonly referred to, as “EHR-driven phenotyping” is time-consuming and tedious due to the lack of a widely accepted and standards-based formal information model for defining phenotyping algorithms. To address this overall challenge, the proposed project will design, build and promote an open-access community infrastructure for standards-based development and sharing of phenotyping algorithms, as well as provide tools and resources for investigators, researchers and their informatics support staff to implement and execute the algorithms on native EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of patient cohorts for clinical and genomic research is a costly and time-consuming process. This bottleneck adversely affects public health by delaying research findings, and in some cases by making research costs prohibitively high. To address this issue, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) for identifying patient cohorts has become an increasingly attractive option. This proposal will investigate and implement standards based approaches for computable phenotype identification from multiple EHRs.",National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms,9381197,R01GM105688,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Flowcharts', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Needs Assessment', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'University Hospitals', 'authority', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'database query', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics training', 'information model', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'repository', 'syntax', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2017,745771,0.12306983346971986
"Automated Problem and Allergy Lists Enrichment Based on High Accuracy Information Extraction from the Electronic Health Record ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposed a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer, and established its feasibility. To advance this new system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the commercial EHR system used in our implementation and testing site (Huntsman Cancer Institute and University of Utah Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah), and ready for commercialization efforts, we will work on the following aims: 1) enhance the NLP system performance, scalability, and quality, 2) develop an advanced visualization interface for local adaptation of the NLP system, and 3) integrate the NLP system with a commercial EHR system. A large and varied reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application will also be developed, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and at the University of Utah Hospital (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services incentive payments. Clinacuity will further extend the commercial potential of the system and its output, using modular design principles allowing utilization of each module independently, and enhancing its local adaptability for easier deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical errors cause numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many could be prevented. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information such as entries in electronic lists of problems and allergies. Such lists are available in most electronic health records, but they require manual management and are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. On the other hand, clinical text reports contain the majority of the patient information, including problems and allergies.

"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients.

"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9145227,R01GM097618,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'international partnership', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,539889,0.029419137156922744
"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9228509,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'database structure', 'design', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2016,249000,0.04523280543365918
"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in is infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems. As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,9143798,R01LM010207,"['Accounting', 'Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data access', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward', 'web portal']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,341475,0.08140333962691239
"Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity is associated with high financial cost and increased morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Health care spending due to obesity is estimated to be as high as \$210 billion annually, or 21\% of total national spending. A childhood obesity surveillance system will discern disparities, detect aberrant signals, design targeted interventions, and track change over time. In addition to national public health surveillance systems, local data are increasingly necessary to reflect regional trends. Current systems in Wisconsin are subject to (1) bias estimation of obesity rates, (2) limited data in school-aged children ages 5-10 years, (3) insufficient power to estimate disparities in local subgroups, and (4) limited ability to track local changes over time. Therefore, the impact of investments and collective efforts in Wisconsin childhood obesity prevention has been difficult to measure. This, in turn, demands approaches that overcome and transcend the posited limitations. Since large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, there has been a paradigm shift and accelerated improvements in the use of EHR data for the purpose of population health promotion and tracking of progress. The University of Wisconsin Population Health Information Exchange (PHINEX) database contains de- identified EHR data from a multicenter healthcare system located primarily in south central Wisconsin. In partnership with The Wisconsin Obesity Prevention Initiative, we aim to create an EHR model for a childhood obesity prevention surveillance system. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods using the platform of PHINEX for childhood obesity prevention purposes. This enhance and extend surveillance activities of childhood obesity conditions, and increase the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions aimed at changing policies, systems, and environments associated with childhood obesity. We plan to address the following aims: (1) robust estimation of the spatiotemporal prevalence at area level, (2) hot spot detection on areas with aberrant obesity incidence, and (3) prediction for childhood weight gain phenotypes. The developed and implemented surveillance system can benefit future planning, legislation and implementation in other states and/or surveillance of other acute and chronic health conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood obesity has emerged as a leading health concern in the 21st century. Current data sources from which childhood obesity estimates are derived in most systems are primarily cross-sectional, are from small sample sizes, and/or have limited generalizability. Large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, which provide unprecedented opportunities for individual and population health surveillance. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods to increase the use of large EHR data for childhood obesity prevention purposes, extending the scope of public health surveillance.            ",Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data,9018958,R21HD086754,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family Practice', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hot Spot', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'School-Age Population', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smiling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data structure', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'population based', 'population health', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'user friendly software']",NICHD,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R21,2016,234419,0.04586608627557981
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,9133363,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Preventive measure', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2016,157765,0.020901352121684272
"Use Frailty Status to Predict Postoperative Outcomes in Elderly Patient Frailty is increasingly recognized as a leading indicator of poor health outcomes, even death, as well as a barometer of how well patients respond to treatment. To truly provide patient-centered care, providers should be aware of each patient's frailty status and incorporate it into clinical decision making. Providers can now offer a number of invasive and aggressive procedures for cardiovascular disease, which involve risk, and can be painful. The treatment intensity need to match the expected patient outcome, yet providers do not have a reliable method to estimate prognosis for frail patients. In the study proposed here, we will use a novel approach that leverages the electronic health record (EHR) in identifying patient frailty status, with the goal of supporting retrospective clinical studies and prospective clinical decision making. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated the availability of frailty-related findings in EHR, the feasibility of extracting frailty findings, and the feasibility of using EHR-extracted frailty for outcome prediction. The specific aims of the project are to 1) Create a frailty ontology building on existing functional status and quality of life measurements; 2) Develop ontology guided, natural language processing (NLP) methods for extracting frailty descriptions and measurements; 3) Develop a model to aggregate NLP-extracted frailty findings to generate a patient-level frailty score; 4) Examine the all-cause mortality and all-cause hospital readmission one year after major cardiac procedures in heart failure patients with different frailty scores and assess the impact of this information on surgical decision making. Frailty is an important, but often overlooked, determinant of health outcomes in older adults. Providers can now offer invasive and aggressive treatments for various conditions, but these interventions involve risk and careful patient selection that balances risk and benefit is imperative. We will develop automated methods to extract frailty information from clinical records and generate an aggregated frailty score, which will enable retrospective analyses of EHR data for risk prediction and support prospective clinical decisional making.",Use Frailty Status to Predict Postoperative Outcomes in Elderly Patient,9354376,R56AG052536,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caregivers', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equilibrium', 'Fatigue', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Technology', 'Veterans', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'exercise capacity', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'treatment choice', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NIA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R56,2016,616197,0.03805608323567037
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9115724,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2016,335217,0.10447425873906727

For example, Vioxx, a commonly used  drug, was recently found to cause at least 88,000 occurrences of myocardial infarction, highlighting the  insufficiency of current methods. To date, methods have mainly depended on the use of single sources of data,  primarily from the Federal Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and from  electronic health records (EHRS). Although important, each of the sources has different limitations and  advantages, and therefore, combining the data across them should lead to more effective drug safety  surveillance by increasing the statistical power, and also by allowing each data source to complement the other  sources. We already have developed methods associated with each of the single sources, and therefore, this  is an excellent opportunity to build upon our research accomplishments to advance the state of the art in  pharmacovigilance.   More specifically, we will a) acquire and combine comprehensive clinical data from the electronic health  records (EHRs) of two different health care sites serving diverse populations by utilizing natural language  processing (NLP) to obtain vast quantities of fine-grained data, and then by developing data mining  methodologies on the clinical data to detect novel ADR signals, b) analyze differences in therapy-related risk  factors between the two EHR populations, such as racial and ethnic differences, c) detect ADR signals in the  FAERS database using an established methodology, d) develop improved methods to acquire ADR signals  based on information in the literature, and e) develop methods that utilize the results from the above sources to  maximize effectiveness. We will focus on eight serious ADRs, and collect a high-quality reference standard for  those ADRs so that we will be able to evaluate and compare performance of the different detection methods  individually as well as the methods that combine the sources.   This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods, which  are primarily based on use of individual sources of data. We are confident the methods will be effective  because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in  this proposal presents an excellent chance to leverage heterogeneous data sources to dramatically improve  patient safety and reduce costs. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and health care, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring huge costs, and, therefore, continuous post-marketing surveillance  is crucial for patient safety. This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by  developing effective methods to discover new adverse drug reactions through the combination of information in  the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, the literature, and comprehensive clinical data from electronic  health records of two different sites with diverse populations, thereby overcoming limitations that rely mainly on  use of one data source.",Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data,9109047,R01LM010016,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Probability', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data mining', 'ethnic difference', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prevent', 'racial difference', 'research and development', 'text searching']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,430717,0.019717906911341197
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.            ",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9094161,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2016,652772,0.09988432300199372
"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9158403,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,370421,0.040023372740563765
"SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs)  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smart algorithms that effectively analyze patient care data can enhance clinical communication to save lives. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine estimated 98,000 preventable patient deaths occur annually in US hospitals due to miscommunication [1]. Electronic health records (EHRs) were expected to facilitate accurate communication within the care team and provide data to enable automated clinical decision support systems. Unfortunately, miscommunication remains a significant cause of patient deaths [2]. Providers are now required to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR systems to improve quality of care and patient outcomes. Despite this, providers continue to report that EHR systems are cumbersome and interfere with care-team communication. Information entered into an EHR is rarely used by nurses due to the time and difficulty involved in its retrieval. As a result, nurses continue to verbally convey critical patient care information to the next nurse during shift changes. Verbal report or hand-off, where critical patient information is exchanged in only minutes, is inefficient. Worse, it is highly susceptible to communication errors. Broader Impacts: Research: 1) Increase patient safety; 2) Provide preliminary data to expand this work to include physician-physician and physician-RN communication and decision-making in the EHR; 3) Share our discoveries to inform other industries who may also benefit from this technology. Education: 1) Contribute to curriculum enhancements whereby RN students learn strategies to recognize and effectively communicate CEs; 2) As part of curriculum enhancements, include healthcare applications for computer and information science students; 3) Disseminate findings via academic publications, professional meetings, a project website and social media. Mentoring: 1) Mentor budding scientists in the roles of research assistants (RAs) and post doctoral fellows studying nursing and computer science to forge collaborative interdisciplinary relationships for ongoing research; 2) Interest and recruit underrepresented students in STEM and careers in healthcare. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The electronic health record (EHR) has been thought to be a tool to decrease patient deaths related to miscommunication.

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9147612,K01ES026837,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'research facility', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,178606,0.05831096811949313
"NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department Summary Timely identification of relevant or “need to know” clinical information about a patient’s history in the acute care setting can be critical for patient safety and medical decision-making. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. Currently, it is estimated that over 50% of the EHR is free-text. EHR search tools today are often inefficient, simplistic, and unable to rank or evoke the relevance of information for a particular problem or complaint. This is compounded by the fact that EHRs are amassing clinical information at an exponential rate. While the benefits of having a wealth of information at a provider’s fingertips seem obvious, the time and energy cost of culling through enormous amounts of data creates new issues of decreased efficiency and information overload for providers seeking to identify the most pertinent and relevant information about their patients. In the emergency department, where patients can present with life threatening conditions, timely unlocking of clinically relevant information for a patient’s problem or complaint at the point of care can be critical to medical decision-making and patient safety. In this study, we plan to address this challenge through the development of a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information based on the patients presenting complaint. We will accomplish this through the following specific aims: 1) identify and define complaint- specific information elements within a patient’s history and 2) develop and test an NLP-based information retrieval tool. Narrative Patient safety hinges on having right information about the right patient and the right time. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information from EHRs that providers rely upon to make medical decisions for their patients. This study comes at an important time where data in the EHRs is increasing at an exponential rate, creating a new problem for clinicians, that of finding all the relevant information for patient’s particular problem. This is particularly true in the emergency department setting where providers have limited if any prior relationship and often have to make quick decisions for patients with life threatening conditions. This search tool will provide a snapshot of clinically relevant information that the providers can view alongside the structured information already in the EHR. We believe this approach has the potential to increase clinician efficiency, decrease healthcare costs by avoiding duplicate diagnostic tests, and provide clinicians with the tools they need to make well-informed medical decisions, thereby improving patient safety and reducing suffering.",NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department,9245525,R21HS024541,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2016,148922,0.0016608930031206735
"Automated Problem and Allergy Lists Enrichment Based on High Accuracy Information Extraction from the Electronic Health Record ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposed a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer, and established its feasibility. To advance this new system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the commercial EHR system used in our implementation and testing site (Huntsman Cancer Institute and University of Utah Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah), and ready for commercialization efforts, we will work on the following aims: 1) enhance the NLP system performance, scalability, and quality, 2) develop an advanced visualization interface for local adaptation of the NLP system, and 3) integrate the NLP system with a commercial EHR system. A large and varied reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application will also be developed, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and at the University of Utah Hospital (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services incentive payments. Clinacuity will further extend the commercial potential of the system and its output, using modular design principles allowing utilization of each module independently, and enhancing its local adaptability for easier deployment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical errors cause numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many could be prevented. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information such as entries in electronic lists of problems and allergies. Such lists are available in most electronic health records, but they require manual management and are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. On the other hand, clinical text reports contain the majority of the patient information, including problems and allergies. The overall goal of this project is to develop a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the electronic health record.           ",Automated Problem and Allergy Lists Enrichment Based on High Accuracy Information Extraction from the Electronic Health Record,9138574,R42CA180190,"['Adverse drug event', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communications Media', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah', 'Hybrids', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Imagery', 'Incentives', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Work', 'base', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'computerized physician order entry', 'design', 'improved', 'payment', 'prevent', 'processing speed', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'standard measure', 'usability', 'web services']",NCI,"CLINACUITY,INC.",R42,2016,684880,0.030615051316242183
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.            ",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,8964138,R01GM097618,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'natural language', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2015,608132,0.029419137156922744
"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in is infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems. As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,8882547,R01LM010207,"['Accounting', 'Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,80,0.08140333962691239
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,8921191,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2015,159162,0.020901352121684272
"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted. Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Accelerating the pace at which patients are recruited into clinical trials has the potential for improving the speed at which new treatments are made available to the public.",An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records,8906937,R01LM011116,"['Address', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'falls', 'health record', 'improved', 'screening']",NLM,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,297811,0.07807502631390079
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",8911361,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2015,325159,0.10447425873906727
"Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and healthcare, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring a huge cost. The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance  patient safety and reduce costs by discovering novel serious ADRs through use of automated methods that  combine information from large and varied patient populations as well as from the literature. There have been  considerable advances in pharmacovigilance, but more work is needed. For example, Vioxx, a commonly used  drug, was recently found to cause at least 88,000 occurrences of myocardial infarction, highlighting the  insufficiency of current methods. To date, methods have mainly depended on the use of single sources of data,  primarily from the Federal Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and from  electronic health records (EHRS). Although important, each of the sources has different limitations and  advantages, and therefore, combining the data across them should lead to more effective drug safety  surveillance by increasing the statistical power, and also by allowing each data source to complement the other  sources. We already have developed methods associated with each of the single sources, and therefore, this  is an excellent opportunity to build upon our research accomplishments to advance the state of the art in  pharmacovigilance.   More specifically, we will a) acquire and combine comprehensive clinical data from the electronic health  records (EHRs) of two different health care sites serving diverse populations by utilizing natural language  processing (NLP) to obtain vast quantities of fine-grained data, and then by developing data mining  methodologies on the clinical data to detect novel ADR signals, b) analyze differences in therapy-related risk  factors between the two EHR populations, such as racial and ethnic differences, c) detect ADR signals in the  FAERS database using an established methodology, d) develop improved methods to acquire ADR signals  based on information in the literature, and e) develop methods that utilize the results from the above sources to  maximize effectiveness. We will focus on eight serious ADRs, and collect a high-quality reference standard for  those ADRs so that we will be able to evaluate and compare performance of the different detection methods  individually as well as the methods that combine the sources.   This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods, which  are primarily based on use of individual sources of data. We are confident the methods will be effective  because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in  this proposal presents an excellent chance to leverage heterogeneous data sources to dramatically improve  patient safety and reduce costs. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and health care, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring huge costs, and, therefore, continuous post-marketing surveillance  is crucial for patient safety. This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by  developing effective methods to discover new adverse drug reactions through the combination of information in  the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, the literature, and comprehensive clinical data from electronic  health records of two different sites with diverse populations, thereby overcoming limitations that rely mainly on  use of one data source.",Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data,8882546,R01LM010016,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Probability', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prevent', 'racial/ethnic difference', 'research and development', 'text searching']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,417794,0.019717906911341197
"SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs)  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smart algorithms that effectively analyze patient care data can enhance clinical communication to save lives. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine estimated 98,000 preventable patient deaths occur annually in US hospitals due to miscommunication [1]. Electronic health records (EHRs) were expected to facilitate accurate communication within the care team and provide data to enable automated clinical decision support systems. Unfortunately, miscommunication remains a significant cause of patient deaths [2]. Providers are now required to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR systems to improve quality of care and patient outcomes. Despite this, providers continue to report that EHR systems are cumbersome and interfere with care-team communication. Information entered into an EHR is rarely used by nurses due to the time and difficulty involved in its retrieval. As a result, nurses continue to verbally convey critical patient care information to the next nurse during shift changes. Verbal report or hand-off, where critical patient information is exchanged in only minutes, is inefficient. Worse, it is highly susceptible to communication errors. Broader Impacts: Research: 1) Increase patient safety; 2) Provide preliminary data to expand this work to include physician-physician and physician-RN communication and decision-making in the EHR; 3) Share our discoveries to inform other industries who may also benefit from this technology. Education: 1) Contribute to curriculum enhancements whereby RN students learn strategies to recognize and effectively communicate CEs; 2) As part of curriculum enhancements, include healthcare applications for computer and information science students; 3) Disseminate findings via academic publications, professional meetings, a project website and social media. Mentoring: 1) Mentor budding scientists in the roles of research assistants (RAs) and post doctoral fellows studying nursing and computer science to forge collaborative interdisciplinary relationships for ongoing research; 2) Interest and recruit underrepresented students in STEM and careers in healthcare. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The electronic health record (EHR) has been thought to be a tool to decrease patient deaths related to miscommunication. However, the current EHR falls short of this goal. We propose to develop and test an algorithm that will augment the EHR to more effectively assist nurses in decision-making and communication, ultimately increasing patient safety.",SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs) ,8932003,R01EB020395,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'STEM career', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underrepresented Students', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'computer science', 'falls', 'forging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'light weight', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'social', 'tool', 'usability', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2015,248507,0.06839038665922664
"Novel Informatics Approaches for Ascertainment of PAD Status and Adverse Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant and principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified cardiologist, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Senior Associate Consultant in the Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Division. [The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator in translational informatics focused on the development, validation and deployment of electronic tools to the point-of-care to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. The PI intends to leverage the EHR to conduct population-based studies using electronic algorithms that include NLP and by application of state-of-the-art informatics approaches to deliver the knowledge at the point-of-care in support of patient-centered decision-making for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The electronic tools developed will be portable to different institutions and other health conditions. The PI will be uniquely positioned as a cardiologist within a large academic health system working with novel NLP techniques at the interface of the EHR and CDS to rapidly translate knowledge acquired in community-based epidemiologic investigations to patient care.] The PI has proposed a research career development plan to acquire expertise in translational informatics including electronic phenotyping, and automated calculation and visual display of prognostic scores using a novel application integrated with clinical decision support (CDS). The PI will complete comprehensive coursework in informatics science and gain additional patient-oriented and epidemiologic research experience. The primary mentor will be Iftikhar Kullo, M.D., cardiologist and PI of the Mayo Clinic electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) network and a leader in the development and application of electronic phenotyping for genomic studies of PAD.

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.                ",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9044538,K01ES026837,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,178606,0.05831096811949313
"Construction of Relation Detection Framework Empowered by Topic Modeling     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The availability of large volume of EHRs enhances the possibility for using them for health services, EBM and clinical research. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as relation detections between medical events among unstructured EHRs still pose a big challenge, consequently leading to the inaccuracy of patient cohort identification, especially for cross-institutional environment. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that topic modeling can discover data semantics, which can then be employed as significant cues for diverse relation detections among EHRs. Among them, co-referring, temporal relations and domain semantics are intertwined and positively correlated. Up to now, not much research is done to combine the three relations to build a better patient cohort identification system. Therefore, the PI proposes to develop a relation detection framework for EHRs empowered with topic modeling for more accurate patient cohort identification. In the mentored phase, the PI will implement the relation detection framework under the guidance of my mentor team and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross-institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develo a hybrid design with ICD-9, RxNorm and MeSH ontologies for the data semantics discoveries from EHRs and MedLINE respectively and investigate categorization of data semantics aligning with medical ontologies (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources and more importantly to make corrections or adjustments on data semantics, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The independent phase will be in collaboration with both UTHealth and University of Maryland. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on relation detections among EHRs for efficient patient cohort identification. The PI has strong background in computational linguistics and rich experiences in medical clinical records processing and analyses, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, and Terry Therneau, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored phase will be in Mayo Clinic Rochester where the PI will undertake courses in US healthcare system, health system engineering, clinical statistics and clinical epidemiology and will get mentored training in health informatics which is what he needs to continue to strengthen since he didn't get regular training in his PhD education. In the independent R00 phase, the PI will strive for making independent scientific contributions to the use of informatics for healthcare via the implementation of Aims 2 and 3 and via the independent collaborations internal and externally. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing the construction of medical knowledge systems and clinical practices as well as clinical research.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing accurate and real-time patient cohort identification is not fully realized, because corresponding relation detection systems for medical events among EHRs still need improvements. The proposed framework will enable patient cohort identification that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records  Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in its infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems.  As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,8694383,R01LM010207,"['Accounting', 'Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Simulate', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,392500,0.08140333962691239
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session.

"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported.                 Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",8760594,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'programs', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2014,398307,0.10447425873906727
"Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and healthcare, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring a huge cost. The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance  patient safety and reduce costs by discovering novel serious ADRs through use of automated methods that  combine information from large and varied patient populations as well as from the literature. There have been  considerable advances in pharmacovigilance, but more work is needed. For example, Vioxx, a commonly used  drug, was recently found to cause at least 88,000 occurrences of myocardial infarction, highlighting the  insufficiency of current methods. To date, methods have mainly depended on the use of single sources of data,  primarily from the Federal Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and from  electronic health records (EHRS). Although important, each of the sources has different limitations and  advantages, and therefore, combining the data across them should lead to more effective drug safety  surveillance by increasing the statistical power, and also by allowing each data source to complement the other  sources. We already have developed methods associated with each of the single sources, and therefore, this  is an excellent opportunity to build upon our research accomplishments to advance the state of the art in  pharmacovigilance.   More specifically, we will a) acquire and combine comprehensive clinical data from the electronic health  records (EHRs) of two different health care sites serving diverse populations by utilizing natural language  processing (NLP) to obtain vast quantities of fine-grained data, and then by developing data mining  methodologies on the clinical data to detect novel ADR signals, b) analyze differences in therapy-related risk  factors between the two EHR populations, such as racial and ethnic differences, c) detect ADR signals in the  FAERS database using an established methodology, d) develop improved methods to acquire ADR signals  based on information in the literature, and e) develop methods that utilize the results from the above sources to  maximize effectiveness. We will focus on eight serious ADRs, and collect a high-quality reference standard for  those ADRs so that we will be able to evaluate and compare performance of the different detection methods  individually as well as the methods that combine the sources.   This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods, which  are primarily based on use of individual sources of data. We are confident the methods will be effective  because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in  this proposal presents an excellent chance to leverage heterogeneous data sources to dramatically improve  patient safety and reduce costs. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and health care, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring huge costs, and, therefore, continuous post-marketing surveillance  is crucial for patient safety. This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by  developing effective methods to discover new adverse drug reactions through the combination of information in  the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, the literature, and comprehensive clinical data from electronic  health records of two different sites with diverse populations, thereby overcoming limitations that rely mainly on  use of one data source.",Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data,8660067,R01LM010016,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Probability', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data mining', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prevent', 'racial/ethnic difference', 'research and development', 'text searching']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,417795,0.019717906911341197
"SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs)  ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smart algorithms that effectively analyze patient care data can enhance clinical communication to save lives. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine estimated 98,000 preventable patient deaths occur annually in US hospitals due to miscommunication [1]. Electronic health records (EHRs) were expected to facilitate accurate communication within the care team and provide data to enable automated clinical decision support systems. Unfortunately, miscommunication remains a significant cause of patient deaths [2]. Providers are now required to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR systems to improve quality of care and patient outcomes. Despite this, providers continue to report that EHR systems are cumbersome and interfere with care-team communication. Information entered into an EHR is rarely used by nurses due to the time and difficulty involved in its retrieval. As a result, nurses continue to verbally convey critical patient care information to the next nurse during shift changes. Verbal report or hand-off, where critical patient information is exchanged in only minutes, is inefficient. Worse, it is highly susceptible to communication errors. Broader Impacts: Research: 1) Increase patient safety; 2) Provide preliminary data to expand this work to include physician-physician and physician-RN communication and decision-making in the EHR; 3) Share our discoveries to inform other industries who may also benefit from this technology. Education: 1) Contribute to curriculum enhancements whereby RN students learn strategies to recognize and effectively communicate CEs; 2) As part of curriculum enhancements, include healthcare applications for computer and information science students; 3) Disseminate findings via academic publications, professional meetings, a project website and social media. Mentoring: 1) Mentor budding scientists in the roles of research assistants (RAs) and post doctoral fellows studying nursing and computer science to forge collaborative interdisciplinary relationships for ongoing research; 2) Interest and recruit underrepresented students in STEM and careers in healthcare. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The electronic health record (EHR) has been thought to be a top! to decrease patient deaths related to miscommunication. However, the current EHR falls short of this goal. We propose to develop and test an algorithm that will augment the EHR to more effectively assist nurses in decision-making and communication, ultimately increasing patient safety.                 n/a",SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs) ,8894220,R01EB020395,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'STEM career', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'computer science', 'falls', 'forging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'light weight', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'social', 'usability', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2014,251572,0.06800986837174422
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session.

"EHR-based patient safety: Automated error detection in neonatal intensive care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the field of neonatal patient safety, the paucity of systematic research is a critical barrier to progress. Notably missing are studies that meticulously investigate Electronic Health Records (EHR) and information technology in detecting neonatal intensive care-related errors. The expert panel at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD) identified multiple gaps in the current knowledge of neonatal patient safety research. The proposed work is a well focused response to three dimensions of the Funding Opportunity Announcement:  1.Develop prospective and retrospective study designs to collect data on patient safety and adverse events.  2.Study the strength and limitations of current methods of error reporting systems.  3.Study the usefulness of commercial IT systems and EHRs in reducing medical errors.  In our study we seek to shift patient safety research toward an automated and computerized approach to achieve a more comprehensive patient safety paradigm. We will develop novel Electronic Health Record (EHR) content-based automated algorithms that are new to patient safety research to 1) detect errors (Aim 1) and 2) categorize subsequent harm (Aim 2). State of the art information extraction and statistical classification techniques from the field of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) will be adapted to the patient safety research tasks.  In Aim 1 we will fill the gap in the literatre by implementing a focused manual review of 700 charts (one full year of patient admissions at our institution) in one of the largest Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) in the nation. Using a trigger tool, we will identify errors occurring in three specified categories - laboratory test errrs, medication/fluid errors, and airway management errors. We will develop novel algorithms for automated EHR-based detection of the errors and evaluate the performance of the new algorithms against the performance of both trigger tool review by human chart reviewers (current gold standard) and the voluntary incident reporting system (accepted standard). In Aim 2, we will study the utility of novel EHR-based information extraction and statistical algorithms for the automated categorization of errors according to the resulting level of harm.

"Pharmacovigilance Methods: Leveraging Heterogeneous Adverse Drug Reaction Data Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and healthcare, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring a huge cost. The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance  patient safety and reduce costs by discovering novel serious ADRs through use of automated methods that  combine information from large and varied patient populations as well as from the literature. There have been  considerable advances in pharmacovigilance, but more work is needed. For example, Vioxx, a commonly used  drug, was recently found to cause at least 88,000 occurrences of myocardial infarction, highlighting the  insufficiency of current methods. To date, methods have mainly depended on the use of single sources of data,  primarily from the Federal Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and from  electronic health records (EHRS). Although important, each of the sources has different limitations and  advantages, and therefore, combining the data across them should lead to more effective drug safety  surveillance by increasing the statistical power, and also by allowing each data source to complement the other  sources. We already have developed methods associated with each of the single sources, and therefore, this  is an excellent opportunity to build upon our research accomplishments to advance the state of the art in  pharmacovigilance.   More specifically, we will a) acquire and combine comprehensive clinical data from the electronic health  records (EHRs) of two different health care sites serving diverse populations by utilizing natural language  processing (NLP) to obtain vast quantities of fine-grained data, and then by developing data mining  methodologies on the clinical data to detect novel ADR signals, b) analyze differences in therapy-related risk  factors between the two EHR populations, such as racial and ethnic differences, c) detect ADR signals in the  FAERS database using an established methodology, d) develop improved methods to acquire ADR signals  based on information in the literature, and e) develop methods that utilize the results from the above sources to  maximize effectiveness. We will focus on eight serious ADRs, and collect a high-quality reference standard for  those ADRs so that we will be able to evaluate and compare performance of the different detection methods  individually as well as the methods that combine the sources.   This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods, which  are primarily based on use of individual sources of data. We are confident the methods will be effective  because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in  this proposal presents an excellent chance to leverage heterogeneous data sources to dramatically improve  patient safety and reduce costs. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major burden for patients and health care, causing preventable  hospitalizations and deaths, and incurring huge costs, and, therefore, continuous post-marketing surveillance  is crucial for patient safety.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback.

"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.                  Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials.

"Applying NLP to Free Text as an EHR Data Capture Method to Improve EHR Usability     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to ensure the ability of ""NLP-Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation,"" a method of EHR data capture involving Natural Language Processing and possibly also standard EHR data capture, to improve the usability of EHR by reducing documentation time, increasing documentation quality, and increasing clinician satisfaction. Problem to be Addressed. Limited usability of the Electronic Health Record (""EHR"") and lack of standardized terminology impedes EHR adoption and optimal use, and therefore hinders realization of a universally interoperable and evidence-based reportable health care system. Large amounts of time required for documentation, low clinician satisfaction, and incomplete documentation are problems plaguing EHR. Innovation. Current research has demonstrated that NLP may be used for EHR data capture. ZyDoc is furthering the state of research by assessing the capability of NLP-Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation to improve EHR usability along several criteria. Long Term Goal. By enabling interoperability and improving EHR usability, through improving clinician satisfaction, improving documentation quality, and reducing data capture time, MediSapien will encourage widespread EHR adoption and optimal use with structured data. Phase I Summary. The purpose of the first Specific Aim of this grant proposal is to ensure that NLP- Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation is capable of improving clinician satisfaction, efficiency, and documentation quality, relative to standard EHR data capture methods. The purpose of the second Specific Aim is to improve the accuracy of MediSapien's coding. These Specific Aims will ensure the technical feasibility of NLP-Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation and MediSapien for improving EHR usability. Phase II Objectives. In Phase II, ZyDoc will complete product development, beta test MediSapien at two hospitals, and measure the product's impact on clinical outcomes or documentation results. Commercial Opportunity. ZyDoc will offer MediSapien as a modular component by partnering with vendors that combine MediSapien in their own solutions, enabling their clients to meet EHR meaningful use standards.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited usability of the Electronic Health Record (""EHR"") and lack of standardized terminology impedes EHR adoption and meaningful use, and therefore hinders realization of a universally interoperable and evidence- based reportable health care system. This proposal aims to prove that EHR usability can be increased by applying NLP and other technologies to convert dictated and transcribed unstructured text to structured data and inserting it into the EHR. Achievement of this result will encourage optimal EHR use with searchable, structured data that will enable interoperability.                  Limited usability of the Electronic Health Record (""EHR"") and lack of standardized terminology impedes EHR adoption and meaningful use, and therefore hinders realization of a universally interoperable and evidence- based reportable health care system.

"Voice Based, Workflow Enhancing, Primary Care Medical Data Input System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) in hospitals and physician offices has been widely promoted as a single solution to a wide variety of health care issues. Yet 84% of small and medium business (SMB) physician practices in the US have not adopted EHR systems. Interventional Dynamics Corporation (IDC) has conducted more than 200 primary care physician interviews, finding that the major disincentives to adoption are workflow delay and expense. The single greatest factor in the reduction of workflow speed is the data input process. IDC's proposed project has this specific aim: Utilize an innovative voice entry technique and open source code systems to develop a low-cost, automated solution to allow primary care physicians to complete a primary care note entirely during the patient examination process. The narrative speech input will be analyzed in a context-sensitive, domain-restricted manner to produce structured clinical data that can be readily integrated into standards-compliant electronic medical records. By using speech inputs that are converted directly to relevant EHR entries, physicians can increase the accuracy of their notes, eliminate third party transcription errors and avoid workflow delays. The project approach will include:    Further testing and final development of DocTalk, the IDC patent pending speech system that allows accurate natural language processing of structured medical information; Development of a proof-of-concept data system that converts physician voice input from voice to text to structured text to EHR data using domain enhanced open source code; The evaluation of the effectiveness of the proof-of-concept system against traditional EHR  input methods with the following goals: Achieve 50% or more reduction in charting time,  achieve 90% or more accuracy in output, and score greater than 4 of 5 on subjective  metrics including learnability, workflow fit, usability, and overall satisfaction. Successful completion of the proposed program will provide IDC with a viable technology platform that can immediately be useful to primary care physicians in generating structured documents for use with their current EHR platforms. Furthermore, the technology developed and refined within this program can be expanded in multiple ways.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The IDC technology is designed to circumvent the normal barriers to adoption in the SMB market and allow for quick increases in workflow and quality of patient care at a minimal price point. IDC will provide physicians who currently use pen and paper a more natural and faster way to input clinical data, eliminating time spent on hunt-and-peck keyboard entry or complicated EHR screen navigation. The system will generate structured clinical data that enables the exchange of health information, the portability of patient records, billing, data analytics (both local practice and public health), marketing, and other benefits, resulting in the reduction of overall healthcare costs.           Narrative The IDC technology is designed to circumvent the normal barriers to adoption in the SMB market and allow for quick increases in workflow and quality of patient care at a minimal price point.

"Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease ABSTRACT The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Elsie Ross, Assistant Professor of Surgery (Vascular Surgery) and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics Research) at Stanford University, the support necessary to transition her from a junior investigator into an independent surgeon-scientist in translational biomedical informatics. Dr. Ross is a vascular surgeon with an advanced degree in health services research and postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics. Her long-term goal is to combine her interdisciplinary training to develop and implement machine learning tools that will enable the delivery of precise, high-value care to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Her career development activities focus on advancing her ability to translate informatics discoveries into viable clinical tools by 1) completing didactic courses to deepen and expand her knowledge of deep learning algorithms, clinical trials and implementation science, 2) designing and conducting her first independent human subjects clinical research study evaluating the performance of machine learning technology, 3) implementing and evaluating the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based screening tool to identify latent vascular disease, and 4) strengthening her previous training in cost-effectiveness analysis to enable her future aim of evaluating the associated costs and utility of pro-active, automated disease screening. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr. Nigam Shah, a biomedical informatics expert who combines machine learning, text-mining and medical ontologies to enable a learning health care system; Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey a world-expert in cardiovascular clinical trials; and Dr. Paul Heidenreich, an expert in implementation sciences with a focus on the use of EHR interventions to improve care quality for cardiovascular patients and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new technologies. The research proposal builds on the candidate's prior work with using machine learning and EHR data to evaluate and predict cardiovascular disease outcomes. The candidate now proposes to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms in identifying patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) using EHR data (Aim 1), evaluate whether learned classification models perform better than traditional risk factors for identification of undiagnosed PAD in a prospective patient cohort (Aim 2), and implement an EHR-based screening tool to identify patients with undiagnosed PAD and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment effects (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will result in a novel, EHR-based screening tool for identification of undiagnosed vascular disease that can decrease PAD-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through earlier and more aggressive medical management. This research will also form the basis for an R01 application before the end of the award to conduct a multi-site randomized-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of EHR- based proactive PAD screening. ! ! !

"Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Despite the widespread adoption of new drug classes to treat epilepsy, approximately one third of patients do not respond to anti-epileptic medication. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) suffer permanent memory and cognitive impairment from uncontrolled seizures. Only 8-10% of patients with DRE obtain long-term seizure freedom. About half of patients with DRE are eligible for surgical treatment, which results in seizure freedom in 58-73% of patients. However, it is difficult to determine when patients with DRE need surgery. DRE has a complex disease course that fluctuates according to weekly and monthly patterns. Further, neurologists report that they lack the resources (i.e. time) needed to analyze and interpret large amounts of electronic health record (EHR) data to determine surgical candidacy. This results in substantial delays in treatment - 6 years in pediatrics and 20 years in adults, on average - and contributes to avoidable morbidity and mortality. Automated systems are capable of assisting clinicians in identifying candidates for epilepsy surgery two years earlier in the disease course. One such system uses natural language processing to analyze free-text neurology notes in a real-time clinical setting. This system was able to increase the rate of surgical candidate identification by 46%, but it could still be improved in two important ways. First, the system is not able to incorporate results from EEG and MRIs - the most influential factors on surgical candidacy - into its recommendations. Second, it does not utilize rich information hidden in structured EHR data that captures epilepsy disease burden. A system that fuses information from all three data sources (neurology notes, EEG and MRI reports, and structured data) would drastically improve the accuracy and impact of the model. In the proposed research, I will first develop a deep learning (DL) approach for fusing multi-modal EHR data. Specifically, I will use recent advances in deep representation learning to produce richer features from both free- text and structured data. I will represent free-text in neurology notes and EEG and MRI reports with word embedding vectors, and medication, procedure, and visit codes with medical concept vectors. I will combine disparate data sources with a deep neural network to produce high-level representations of surgical candidacy. This will enable me to estimate patients' risk of future epilepsy surgery. Second, I will establish the generalizability of this approach using a neighboring hospital's EHR data and validate the system in a clinical setting. This contribution will be significant because it will increase the number of surgical candidates identified earlier in the disease course, thereby reducing epilepsy disease sequelae. This proposal will lay the groundwork for nationwide expansion of the DL system and generate the only automated DL system designed to improve the timeliness of surgical referral rates in the adult population. Project Narrative Automating the identification of patients with epilepsy who would benefit from surgical treatment is imperative to reducing morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled seizures. This research proposal will develop and clinically validate a generalizable deep learning framework for analyzing multi-modal electronic health record data to predict epilepsy surgery candidacy. Implementing this system into clinical care is expected to reduce the time to surgery by 45%, which would prevent one epilepsy-related death for every 58 patients who receive surgery.",Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery,10066989,F31NS115447,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'candidate identification', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'structured data', 'tool', 'vector']",NINDS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,F31,2020,39617,0.026860732828173438
"Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing, and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations: insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3, we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non- VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers as clinical-investigators. Physical frailty is common in adults with heart failure and increases the risk for poor health outcomes. Clinicians need tools to identify adults with physical frailty as part of routine care to support early intervention to treat frailty and reduce this risk. This application seeks to develop a novel measure of physical frailty using data collected as part of routine clinical care and recorded in the electronic health record.",Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure,9953749,K25HL152006,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'American', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Quality of Care', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'frailty', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'random forest', 'routine care', 'screening', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K25,2020,143822,0.010426223694528407
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9838270,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'multiple data types', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,794994,0.036617967966110394
"Characterizing and targeting subphenotypes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder via individually imputed tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are highly heritable, severe and complex brain disorders characterized by substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity. Despite this, case-control studies often ignore such heterogeneity through their focus on the average patient, which may be the core reason for a lack of robust biomarkers indicative of an individual’s treatment response and outcome. Although they are classified as independent diagnostic entities, SCZ and BD are highly genetically correlated, exhibit high relative risks among relatives of both BD & SCZ patients, and have partially overlapping symptomatology and treatment. In this project we will use tissue and cell-type specific imputed transcriptomes for individuals with SCZ or BD in our VA discovery cohort comprising the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and Cooperative Studies Program 572 (CSP #572, “The Genetics of Functional Disability in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Illness”), as an intermediate molecular phenotype, to identify, characterize and target subphenotypes of these disorders. Findings from the VA discovery cohort will be validated in the PsycheMERGE and BioMe cohorts.  First, we will impute tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes for all individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) or bipolar disorder (BD) in the VA discovery cohort. To achieve this, we will train tissue (brain and peripheral tissues) and cell-type (glutamatergic & GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia from DLPFC) specific EpiXcan transcriptomic imputation models at the gene and isoform level. Secondly, we will use the imputed transcriptomes as an intermediate molecular phenotype to identify genetically-regulated gene expression (GReX) based subpopulations and within them the key molecular drivers using deep neural networks (DNNs). Lastly, we will identify key non-genetic biomarkers and effective treatments for each validated subphenotype. Non-genetic biomarkers will be based on pre-mined features available from the electronic health records (EHR) and features extracted from the EHR via natural language processing (NLP). The subphenotypes will be validated in the civilian cohorts PsycheMERGE and BioMe.  This project will take place at the Icahn School of Medicine, one of the leading centers of data science, genomics and precision medicine. The mentoring committee comprises experts in the fields of computational and functional genomics, integrative analysis, machine learning (including DNNs and NLP), and EHR mining. Dr. Voloudakis will develop the skills necessary to launch an independent academic career in genetically based EHR-informed precision psychiatry.

"Deep clinical trajectory modeling to optimize accrual to cancer clinical trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Electronic health records (EHRs) are now ubiquitous in routine cancer care delivery. The large volumes of data that EHRs contain could constitute an important resource for research and quality improvement, but to date, EHRs have not fully realized this potential. Important clinical endpoints, such as disease histology, stage, response, progression, and burden, are often recorded in the EHR only in unstructured free-text form. Even when structured data are available, they may be recorded only at one point in time, such as diagnosis, and may not be as relevant later in a patient's dynamic disease trajectory. These barriers prevent scalable analysis of EHR data for even relatively straightforward research tasks, such as identification of a cohort of patients potentially eligible for clinical trials. Identifying patients for trials is an important challenge in cancer research, since under 5% of adults with cancer have historically enrolled in therapeutic trials. Tools are in development to better match patients to trials, but no such tools are both publicly available and capable of incorporating time- specific patient phenotypes generated using unstructured EHR data. Recent rapid innovation in deep learning techniques could provide novel solutions to these challenges. In ongoing work, I have found that natural language processing based on a neural network architecture can reliably extract clinically relevant oncologic endpoints from free-text radiology reports. My goal is to develop an independent research program focused on leveraging such methods to put the EHR to use at scale for discovery and improving cancer care delivery. My specific aims are (1) to develop and validate a clinically relevant, dynamic, pre-trained cancer trajectory model by applying deep learning to integrated structured and unstructured EHR data; (2) to apply transfer learning to a pre-trained cancer trajectory model to match patients to clinical trials using EHR data and clinical trial protocols; and (3) to pilot the incorporation of cancer trajectory modeling into an institutional clinical trial matching tool. In the near term, this work will facilitate accrual to clinical trials at our institution. During the independent research portion of the proposal, it will constitute the basis for a general framework for conducting scalable cancer research using EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) are now ubiquitous in routine cancer care delivery, but their utility for research and quality improvement has been limited by a dearth of methods for integrating the unstructured data in which most key cancer outcomes are encoded within EHRs. I propose to apply recent innovations in deep learning to integrate structured and unstructured data to create a dynamic pre-trained model of cancer patients' treatment trajectories, and to apply this model to identify patients who are appropriate candidates for clinical trials at times when they are eligible. I will then evaluate the effect of trajectory modeling on clinical trial accrual as I prepare for an independent research career focused on clinical cancer data science.",Deep clinical trajectory modeling to optimize accrual to cancer clinical trials,9880481,K99CA245899,"['Academia', 'Adult', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histology', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer care', 'cancer clinical trial', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial enrollment', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'design', 'electronic data', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'multiple data types', 'neoplasm registry', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'palliative', 'patient population', 'precision medicine clinical trials', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'skills', 'structural genomics', 'structured data', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'unstructured data']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K99,2020,170176,0.0397909778424756
"Development of End-To-End Clinical Decision Support Tools To Prevent Cardiotoxic Drug Response SUMMARY Drug-induced cardiac toxicity, in the form of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, is an uncommon but devastating side effect of over one hundred currently marketed drugs. The ubiquity of drug-induced QT prolongation (diLQTS) across medical specialties and conditions creates a challenge for providers seeking to prescribe known QT-prolonging medications, particularly for non-cardiac conditions. Work by our group to develop automated clinical decision support (CDS) tools that alert providers of patient risk has shown promise towards reducing the number of prescriptions to at-risk individuals. However, these tools rely on a history of an electrocardiogram (ECG) with QT prolongation to identify at-risk patients, and thus exclude a large number of potentially at-risk individuals who have not had an ECG within our system. Through a unique institutional partnership with Google, in which a copy of our entire electronic health record (EHR) is stored on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), we have developed preliminary deep-learning models to predict risk of diLQTS. We have also validated the genetic association with the QT interval and diLQTS across several real-world populations using an aggregate polygenic risk score. Through creation of an institutional biobank with certification for clinical application of results, as well as cloud-based integration of EHR data with genetic data, we have the capability to leverage our existing infrastructure to study the role of deep learning and genetics to reduce the risk of diLQTS. This investigation will combine our unique research and clinical infrastructure on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus with our investigative team composed of experts in the study of pharmacogenomics and medical informatics to develop and study an end-to-end CDS tool incorporating genetics and deep learning to predict risk of diLQTS. The specific aims of this application include the following: (1) develop and test a cloud-based, deep-learning model using EHR data on in- and outpatients to predict risk of diLQTS; (2) validate genetic predictors of diLQTS using institutional biobank samples, and a multi-ethnic external population; and (3) develop and test CDS tools using these advanced methods to reduce the risk of diLQTS. We will use a common data model (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) mapped from EHR data, as well as a custom DNA array (Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array) designed for imputation across a variety of non-European ancestries, to ensure that the our prediction model and findings from this study can be replicated in other institutions and populations in the future. In such a way, this investigation will not only provide insight into the use of machine learning and genetics for risk prediction of diLQTS, but it will also create a blueprint for future advanced CDS development for other conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is the development of a clinical decision support tool that can be used to predict the risk of drug-induced QT prolongation based on deep learning and genetics. This tool could be used to prevent potentially fatal side effects of medications when alternatives are available, or increase vigilance when safer alternatives are not available.

"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales. These methods are evaluated using public datasets to promote reproducibility, and applied to clinical research tasks that extend the knowledge of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital.",Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks,9868326,R01LM012973,"['Architecture', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Face', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Rare Diseases', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Uncertainty', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'machine translation', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,367184,0.010301116675110277
"Sarcopenia: computable phenotypes and clinical outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY  Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function. Sarcopenia contributes to disability, increased hospitalizations, healthcare costs, and risk of death. Despite being under- recognized clinically, sarcopenia is a major public health concern, with the worldwide prevalence projected to increase by up to 72% in the next 30 years. However, limited knowledge of sarcopenia among clinicians, combined with time pressures in clinical encounters delay its detection, and limit opportunity for intervention or recruitment into clinical trials. To overcome this barrier to detecting sarcopenia, we propose to use advanced big data and machine learning methods to identify additional component variables predicting sarcopenia among the rich electronic health record (EHR) data and develop a validated and portable sarcopenia computable phenotype (which uses a computer algorithm to detect patient characteristics or outcomes from the EHR). This innovative proposal takes advantage of key resources at Indiana University and its affiliation with the Regenstrief Institute and the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a statewide multi-health system clinical data warehouse including >100 healthcare entities and >18 million unique patients with both coded and text-based data, combined with the ability to perform comprehensive musculoskeletal measurements in the Musculoskeletal Function Imaging and Tissue (MSK-FIT) Core funded through a NIAMS Core Center for Clinical Research grant (P30AR072581). Our long-term goal is to accurately identify patients with, or at risk for, sarcopenia and its consequences in order to provide targeted interventions. We hypothesize that by using medical informatics and machine learning innovations, computable phenotypes can identify patients with sarcopenia from the EHR, predict deficits in measured muscle strength and physical function, and prospectively predict risk of hospitalization and death. In Aim 1, we will categorize >2000 adult participants in the MSK-FIT Core with accessible EHR data, as either sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic according to measurements of muscle strength, muscle mass and physical performance. We will then use 75% of the MSK- FIT Core cohort to train machine deep learning algorithms to detect combinations of variables from these subjects’ EHR predicting whether the patient is sarcopenic or not sarcopenic. The performance of the resulting computable phenotype will then be tested in the remaining 25% of the MSK-FIT Core participants. In Aim 2, we will test the performance of the sarcopenia computable phenotype to detect a clinically meaningful phenotype in the entire INPC adult population (>18 million), by evaluating the ability to predict the rate of hospitalizations and death among patients rated as sarcopenic versus matched controls. Such a computable phenotype will then enable large scale targeted recruitment, pragmatic clinical trials, clinical evaluation and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function, and contributing to disability, increased hospitalizations and risk of death. Despite being underrecognized clinically, sarcopenia is a major public health concern, with projected large increases in its prevalence worldwide. The overall goal of this grant is to use advanced, state-of-the art biomedical informatics and big data methods to generate a tool using electronic health record data to detect patients with sarcopenia early and facilitate patient recruitment, engagement and clinical interventions to treat sarcopenia.",Sarcopenia: computable phenotypes and clinical outcomes.,9970930,R01AR077273,"['Adult', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Birth', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Exercise', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand Strength', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methods', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'age group', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical center', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical encounter', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality risk', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'performance tests', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'portability', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'reduced muscle mass', 'research clinical testing', 'sarcopenia', 'sex', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIAMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,235788,0.052893170607997496
"Learning Health System Building Blocks: Filling Gaps to Enable a Real Time Physician-AI Partnership PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 54% of doctors are experiencing burnout and the primary cause is documentation. Doctors spend up to two hours on clerical work for each hour of direct patient care. Documentation burden is the number one contributor to burnout, which costs the US health care system approximately $150 billion each year. Further, the largely free-text notes generated by healthcare providers are difficult to process and re-use for quality improvement and research. There is a significant opportunity to A) reduce clinicians' clerical burden via ambient data collection while B) enabling incorporation of machine learning into routine clinical care by structuring information in real-time from the patient-doctor conversation. We have built a service that saves each clinician hours per day by using remote human scribes, who we make more efficient with machine learning and natural language processing, to automatically document patient visits. The service runs on a laptop or mobile device and converts patient-clinician conversation audio to structured documentation. Our approach has already enabled the service to be priced at half the cost of a traditional in- person scribe. Finalized notes can be saved into all common electronic health record (EHR) systems via the Redox interoperability interface. We will use the human-curated audio-to-structured documentation dataset to further improve preprocessing, automating more of the scribing process, and reducing human effort over time. A time motion study and EHR click log analysis in a clinical setting demonstrated time savings of up to two hours per clinician per day. We have successfully generated documentation for over 1,700 patient visits and our dataset will double in size in 2 months. In Phase I, we address key impediments in the structure and timeliness of current EHR data, both of which can be improved with our novel system when coupled with the real-time generation of machine learning-ready inputs. In order to do so, we propose three aims: 1) extract machine learning-ready inputs from patient-doctor conversation audio; 2) extract machine learning-ready inputs from structured and unstructured EHR data; 3) further increase cost-efficiency and scale up the quality assurance process using machine learning inputs from conversation audio and historical EHR data. For Phase II we will apply our machine learning inputs to predict disease trajectory for multiple disease phenotypes with a focus on type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. These diseases are ideal proofs-of- concept due to their high prevalence, morbidity, and inclusion in incentive programs for closing care gaps. The $6.3B in 2018 Medicare Advantage incentives supports a clear business case for leveraging machine learning to achieve value-based goals – improving patient care quality and efficiency.! PROJECT NARRATIVE PredictionHealth has built a service to reduce doctor burnout by automatically documenting patient visits by processing audio from the normal patient-doctor conversation - potentially reducing the $150 billion dollar cost of burnout on the US health system. We propose that integrating and facilitating the application of machine learning in routine clinical care can improve patient care outcomes and efficiency. The primary goal of this Phase I proposal is to further improve the service's cost-efficiency with real-time machine learning predictions based on structured inputs from the patient-doctor conversation and prepare to integrate machine learning as an integral element of each doctor's toolbox.",Learning Health System Building Blocks: Filling Gaps to Enable a Real Time Physician-AI Partnership,10009209,R43LM013215,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Pressure', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Cost efficiency', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Savings', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Time and Motion Studies', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'burnout', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'direct patient care', 'disease phenotype', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'laptop', 'novel', 'payment', 'phase 2 study', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment planning']",NLM,PREDICTION HEALTH INC.,R43,2020,222130,0.05785925712411089
"Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients Failure to rescue (FTR), a nurse-sensitive national metric of health care quality, refers to death of a hospitalized patient from a treatable complication, and is potentiated by failure to recognize and appropriately respond to early signs of complications. There is a paucity of research examining patient features predictive of FTR complications. Such information could shift the current paradigm of nursing surveillance to earlier recognition, prevention and treatment of FTR complications, thereby saving lives. New-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE), an FTR complication occurring as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable hospital death, carrying a high risk of mortality and a national cost burden of $7 billion annually. VTE is a complex disease process involving interactions between clinical risk factors and acquired and/or inherited susceptibilities to thrombosis. Although biomarkers and clinical factors associated with VTE have been identified, clinical manifestations are subtle, presenting gradually over hours to days. Current VTE risk assessment models (RAM), the cornerstone of prevention, have limited utility due to their complexity and lack of reliability, generalizability and external validation. A critical gap in VTE risk modeling research is that while new-onset VTE pathology evolves over the course of hospitalization, no current models incorporate the progressive accrual of dynamic patient data and pattern evolution over time in their modeling approaches. The totality of routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data is massive in terms of volume, variety, and production at a rapid velocity in real-time. Such big data could be used in machine learning (ML) analytic approaches to process time series clinical data to identify subtle, evolving feature patterns predictive of new-onset VTE and address this gap. This study proposes to assemble a large scale, multi-source, multi-dimensional VTE study dataset, and in tandem, systematically define the EHR data elements associated with a new-onset VTE diagnosis for computable phenotype algorithm development. We will then apply machine learning analytic approaches to baseline and accruing intensive time series clinical data in the curated dataset to develop models identifying data patterns and features predictive of dynamically evolving new-onset VTE in adult hospitalized patients. This proposal aligns with NINR’s strategic vision for nurse scientists to employ new strategies for collecting and analyzing complex big data sets to permit better understanding of the biological underpinnings of health, and improve ways nurses prevent and manage illness. This innovative study and individualized training plan under a strong and well- established team, represents initial steps in the applicant’s research trajectory focused on data science approaches to predict FTR complication risk, and develop, implement and test dynamic RAMs to inform targeted prevention and treatment decisions. Discovering new knowledge informing real-time decision making, nursing surveillance practices and care delivery systems can improve nurse sensitive patient outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death. This study first proposes to develop a reproducible computable phenotype definition for new-onset VTE cohort ascertainment from the electronic health record, and then develop dynamic models for VTE risk assessment through the application of machine learning algorithms to massive electronic health record clinical data repositories. Such models can inform the mechanisms underlying this complex disease and identify subtle pattern changes in a patient’s condition forecasting a VTE event, enabling earlier nurse identification and intervention, and decreasing the development of complications and failure to rescue in hospitalized patients.",Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients,10219195,F31NR018102,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Quality of Care', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Vision', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'care delivery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computable phenotypes', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multidimensional data', 'prevent', 'venous thromboembolism']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2020,17002,0.03839597894053447
"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); In recent years, there has been increasing evidence supporting the role of DSs in ADRD in preventing cognitive impairment but there is limited evidence and the sample sizes have been small. Real- world data (RWD) especially the EHR contain detailed treatment and response information from patients and could be used to detect the usage and effect of DSs, DSIs, which is more translational to clinical outcomes (e.g., MCI to ADRD conversion). To the best of our knowledge, there is no investigation on DSs usage and safety among patients in MCI and ADRD using EHR data. Our current parent award is focusing on the development of a translational informatics framework to enable the discovery of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs) by linking scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. To response to NOT-AG-20-008, this administrative supplement application will complement our parent award in multiple aspects: (1) developing novel and advanced data analytic methods for mining RWD in EHR, (2) identifying DSs usage information among patients with ADRD, and (3) detecting safety and effect of DS among patients with ADRD from existing EHR data. In our preliminary work, we have investigated the methods to identify DSs terms on EHR and developed natural language processing (NLP) methods to identify use status of DSs. We will further our efforts to collect a EHR dataset with DSs usage and AE-DSs signals from AD patients and develop innovative informatics methods to extract such information. Our specific aims are: (1) identifying DSs usage among patients with MCI and ADRD from existing EHR data; and (2) detecting the DSs safety signals and exploring the effect of DSs use on the conversion from MCI to ADRD from existing EHR data. The successful completion of this project will stimulate our further investigation on the role of DS use in patients with ADRD in a larger scale involving EHR data from other healthcare institutions. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this administrative supplement application, we will evaluate the usage and safety of dietary supplements (DSs) usage in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), respectively using electronic health records (EHR) data. We will also explore the feasibility of using EHR to detect DS effect on the conversion from MCI to ADRD. This research will address a critical and unmet need to conduct large-scale clinical research in DSs and improve evidence bases for healthcare practice. The successful accomplishment of this supplement project will deliver a novel informatics methods and generate DSI signals among patients with ADRD.

"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,9873880,R01AG060993,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alabama', 'Algorithms', 'Ally', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational algorithm', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Staff', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Provider', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'confusion assessment method', 'data mining', 'epidemiology study', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care settings', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'model development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phrases', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'ward']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,376860,0.0739880002663781
"Data-driven shared decision-making to reduce symptom burden in atrial fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia with symptoms that directly impair health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While catheter ablation is routinely performed to reduce AF symptoms and improve HRQoL, we lack evidence about which symptoms are likely to improve and for which patients. Ablations themselves may cause complications that lead to lower HRQoL. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a widely encouraged practice to navigate such complex choices by aligning treatment benefits and risks with the patient's stated values. However, no SDM interventions have focused explicitly on AF symptoms due to a lack of rigorous evidence about post-ablation symptom patterns and the decision aids necessary to communicate those findings. In this K99/R00 application, we propose to use data from electronic health records (EHRs) to characterize post-ablation symptom patterns, and display them in decision-aid visualizations to support personalized SDM about the best treatment modalities for an individual's patient's AF symptoms. In the K99 phase, we will use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to extract and analyze symptom data from narrative notes in EHRs. We will also employ a rigorous, user-centered design protocol created during my postdoctoral work to develop decision-aid visualizations. In the R00 phase, we will conduct a feasibility study in which the interactive decision-aid visualizations are introduced during consultations about ablation in clinical electrophysiology practices. Our specific aims are: (1) identify common symptom patterns in patients with paroxysmal AF post-catheter ablation (n>32,014); (2) develop and evaluate decision-aid visualizations of common AF symptom patterns (n=50); and (3) evaluate the feasibility of implementing the decision-aid visualizations in clinical practice (n=75). The training objectives of this project include mastering competencies in NLP, ML, human-computer interaction, symptom science, and implementation science. The long-term training goal is to assist Dr. Reading Turchioe to become a faculty member with an independent program of research. She seeks to lead an interdisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians committed to improving symptom management and HRQoL for individuals living with AF and other chronic cardiovascular conditions, with an eye towards health equity. To ensure success for the planned research and training activities, a multidisciplinary team of mentors with complementary expertise, established, well-funded programs of research, and a record of mentoring high-quality trainees will advise her. Moreover, this research will be conducted in a world-class academic medical center with exceptional resources for building and implementing technology and data science methods using EHR data. The proposed research is both significant and innovative: NLP and ML methods to extract EHR data for decision-aid visualizations are a novel approach to SDM in the understudied area of AF symptoms. Together, these techniques promise to enhance HRQoL for other AF treatment modalities (e.g. medications, lifestyle changes) and other chronic cardiovascular conditions. ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Our research has public health significance because atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and expected to double in prevalence in the next decade as the population ages. “Real-world evidence” from electronic health record data displayed in personalized decision-aid visualizations can enable patients and providers to choose together the optimal treatments for symptom reduction. Our proposal addresses NINR's key areas of “Symptom Science: Promoting Personalized Health Strategies” and “Promoting Innovation: Technology to Improve Health” by leveraging innovative technologies to deliver personalized interventions that reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life for individuals with chronic conditions. !",Data-driven shared decision-making to reduce symptom burden in atrial fibrillation,9953270,K99NR019124,"['Ablation', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiac ablation', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Devices', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enabling Factors', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Informatics', 'Outcome', 'Palpitations', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Reinforcing Factor', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'common symptom', 'comorbidity', 'computer human interaction', 'data visualization', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health equity', 'health related quality of life', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized decision', 'personalized intervention', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'reduce symptoms', 'shared decision making', 'statistics', 'success', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment risk', 'user centered design']",NINR,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K99,2020,87632,0.020825802636671727
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9979940,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'data streams', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,485987,0.054733190635459276
"Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes new methods for representing data in electronic health records (EHR) to improve pre- dictive modeling and interpretation of patient outcomes. EHR data offer a promising opportunity for advancing the understanding of how clinical decisions and patient conditions interact over time to inﬂuence patient health. However, EHR data are difﬁcult to use for predictive modeling due to the various data types they contain (con- tinuous, categorical, text, etc.), their longitudinal nature, the high amount of non-random missingness for certain measurements, and other concerns. Furthermore, patient outcomes often have heterogenous causes and re- quire information to be synthesized from several clinical lab measures and patient visits. The core challenge at hand is overcoming the mismatch between data representations in the EHR and the assumptions underly- ing commonly used statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. To this end, this project proposes novel wrapper-based methods for learning informative features from EHR data. Both methods propose specialized operators to handle sequential data, time delays, and variable interactions, and have the capacity to discover underlying clinical rules/decisions that affect patient outcomes. Importantly, both methods also produce archives of possible models that represent the best trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, which assists in model interpretation. These method advances are made possible by encoding a rich set of data operations as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, and optimizing the graph structures using multi-objective optimization. The central hypothesis of this research is that multi-objective optimization can learn effective data representations from the EHR to produce accurate, explanatory models of patient outcomes. Preliminary work has shown that these methods can effectively learn low-order data representations that improve the predictive ability of several state- of-the-art ML methods. This technique demonstrates good scaling properties with high-dimensional biomedical data. Aim 1 (K99) is to develop a multi-objective feature engineering method that pairs with existing ML methods to iteratively improve their performance by constructing new features from the raw data and using feedback from the trained model to guide feature construction. In Aim 2 (K99), this method is applied to form predictive models of the risk of heart disease and heart failure using longitudinal EHR data. The resultant models will be inter- preted with the help of mentors in order to translate predictions into clinical recommendations. For Aim 3 (R00), a second method is proposed that uses a similar framework to optimize existing neural network approaches in order to simplify their structure as much as possible while maintaining accuracy. The goal of Aim 4 (R00) is to identify hospital patients who are at risk of readmission and propose point-of-care strategies to mitigate that risk. This goal is facilitated through the application of the proposed methods to patient data collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Geisinger Health System, and publicly available EHR databases. Project Narrative  Understanding how clinical decisions interact with a patient's health and environmental over time to inﬂuence patient outcomes is central to the goals of enhancing health, reducing illness and improving quality of life.

"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,10118580,R00NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncology', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2020,248966,-0.01202633374998072
"Bridging the Gap between Genomics and Clinical Outcomes in CHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The NHLBI has invested extensively in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), recognizing that translating genomic discoveries into optimized management and therapeutic strategies for congenital heart disease (CHD) can only be achieved in the context of multi-center, collaborative research. Currently, the PCGC is lacking two fundamental capabilities that hinder its ability to define the genomic basis for CHD outcomes: (1) a robust mechanism for extracting pertinent, machine-readable clinical data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) across multiple institutions; and (2) a robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform that is capable of teasing apart the complex interplay between maternal factors, phenotypes, genotypes, gene functions and clinical outcomes. Here, we propose innovative solutions to these challenges, by assembling teams of content experts to leverage existing infrastructure to extract relevant outcomes directly from the EHR of participating PCGC Centers and by designing best-practice AI tools for outcomes research. Our principal goal is provide the vision, infrastructure and expertise to collaboratively empower CHD outcomes research, foster knowledge exchange, and train the next generation of genomic scientists. We propose to leverage existing data infrastructure to obtain Electronic Health Records (EHR) and other clinical variables at scale by partnering with other research networks to create a PCGC Data Resource. Using this resource, we will create and deploy a platform of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based predictors for CHD outcomes research, with the goal of translating genomic discoveries into improved management and therapeutic strategies for CHD.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The long-term goal of our ongoing project, “Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,” is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to understand and improve health. The EHR, because of its broad capture of human health, greatly amplifies our ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the strength of EHR data—its breadth and flexible nature—imposes additional challenges. We have found that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. We previously showed that health care process bias exists to the extent, for example, that simple use of the data can create signals implying the opposite of what we know to be true. One of the most important factors is sparse, irregular sampling; we found that sampling bias can be reduced by reparameterizing time and that prediction techniques that can accommodate EHR-specific data and resist their biases like data assimilation can be used on EHR data to produce good estimates of glucose and HA1c. The previous cycle of this project produced 75 publications. We propose to develop methods to accommodate health care process bias, using both knowledge engineering and experience with health care process bias as well as advanced statistical techniques that employ dynamical models and latent variables. We hypothesize that heuristics and models combined with knowledge can improve our ability to generate inferences and learn phenotypes despite health care process bias. Our aims are as follows: (1) Taking a knowledge engineering approach, study the effect of preprocessing and analytic choices on reducing health care process bias, and using machine learning techniques, learn more about health care process bias. (2) Taking a more empirical approach, use dynamic latent factor modeling and variation inference to accommodate health care process bias, learning how a patient's health state and health processes affect censoring, exploiting information from many variables at once. (3) Use data assimilation and mechanistic models to learn otherwise unmeasurable physiologic phenotypes despite irregular, sparse sampling typical of electronic health records. (4) Use the developed models and generated phenotypes to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project studies the biases that health care processes bring to electronic health record data, and it develops methods to overcome those biases to improve reuse of the data for purposes such as clinical research and quality improvement.",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,9873996,R01LM006910,"['Active Learning', 'Adopted', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Award', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Insulin', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Observational Study', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'clinical database', 'data reuse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,582678,0.08186977780340689
"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research,9873997,R01MH118233,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data resource', 'delay sex', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'psychiatric genomics', 'random forest', 'sex', 'support tools', 'support vector machine']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,791339,0.03791205516724481
"Deriving high-quality evidence from national healthcare databases to improve suicidality detection and treatment outcomes in PTSD and TBI PROJECT SUMMARY Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has complex profiles of co-occurring medical conditions (comorbidities) and is associated with high risk of suicide, particularly among Veterans, in which it is a leading cause of death. There is a critical lack of advancement in PTSD pharmacotherapy, as illustrated by increased use of off-label medications and polypharmacy (multiple drugs used simultaneously). The consequent limited evidence on the relative risks and benefits of treatments creates a crisis in PTSD management. Moreover, PTSD and its major comorbidities [traumatic brain injury (TBI) and suicidality] often remain undocumented in electronic health records (EHR). There is also poor predictability of disease outcomes since there are frequent changes in pharmacological treatment and multiple modifying comorbidities. Our long-term goal is to improve diagnostics, secondary/tertiary prevention, and treatment outcomes of PTSD and its comorbidities via enhanced EHR utilization. To achieve our objectives, we will analyze EHR and administrative claims data from Veterans Administration (VA) and non-VA databases, collectively covering >2M PTSD and >2M TBI patients. Specifically, we aim to: (1) Identify undetected PTSD, TBI, and self-harm from EHRs (using machine learning with and without natural language language processing) to guide health service improvements. (2) Predict PTSD clinical course in the VA population through novel modeling of disease trajectories that account for time-varying treatments and biases (3) Compare the effectiveness of PTSD psychotropic monotherapies, polypharmacy, and psychotherapy to guide the choice of treatment for improved patient outcomes. By enhancing and validating a machine learning approach developed by our team, we will impute unrecorded PTSD, TBI, and self-harm from both datasets, and characterize factors associated with documentation disparities. We will model diseases trajectories with enhanced latent class analysis, focusing on self-harm, substance misuse, and psychiatric hospitalization in PTSD. With Local Control methodology innovations, we will compare the risk of PTSD in veterans with and without comorbid TBI. Finally, we will perform the largest comparative effectiveness studies (to date) of PTSD treatments on >100 monotherapy and polypharmacy regimens plus psychotherapy interventions. These studies will provide high-quality evidence on the risk of hospitalizations, substance misuse, and suicidal acts/self-harm. Successful completion of these investigations will improve the quality of decision making for providers and patients, and guide improved service delivery to the population of veterans and non-veterans with PTSD/TBI, and/or high risk of suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and its associated conditions (e.g., traumatic brain injury and suicidality) are often underdiagnosed, and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Treatment of PTSD often involves frequent treatment changes with multi-drug regimens (polypharmacy) and off-label medications for which the relative risks and benefits are largely unknown. To address these problems, we will develop and apply methods to identify undiagnosed patients, predict disease trajectories, and compare the effectiveness of all common PTSD treatments using health records from millions of patients in Veterans Administration (VA) and non-VA databases.",Deriving high-quality evidence from national healthcare databases to improve suicidality detection and treatment outcomes in PTSD and TBI,10088135,R56MH120826,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Drug Combinations', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'General Population', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Regimen', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Safety', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans', 'analysis pipeline', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'health record', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'multiple drug use', 'natural language', 'novel', 'off-label drug', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'service delivery', 'sociodemographic factors', 'stress related disorder', 'substance misuse', 'suicidal act', 'suicidal risk', 'tertiary prevention', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'treatment choice', 'treatment comparison']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,R56,2020,776198,-0.01472307673738853
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes.

"Biases introduced by filtering electronic health records for patients with ""complete data"" PROJECT SUMMARY Nationwide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to the increasing availability of large clinical datasets. With statistical modeling and machine learning, these datasets have been be used in a wide range of applications, including diagnosis, decision support, cost reduction, and personalized medicine. However, because the same patient could be treated at multiple health care institutions, data from only a single EHR might not contain the complete medical history for that patient, with critical events potentially missing. A common approach to addressing this problem is to apply data checks that filter the EHR for patients whose data appear to be more “complete”. Examples of filters include requiring at least one visit per year or ensuring that age, sex, and race are all recorded. However, in a previous study using EHR data from seven institutions, we showed that these filters can greatly reduce the sample size and introduce unexpected biases by selecting sicker patients who seek care more often and changing the demographics of the resulting cohorts. This project extends this prior research by implementing an expanded set of data completeness filters and testing their accuracy and potential biases using a combination of national claims data and EHR data from dozens of hospitals and healthcare centers across the country. This will enable us to understand how data completeness varies in different EHRs and quantify the tradeoffs of different approaches to correcting for gaps in patients' records. First, we will develop and measure the accuracy of data completeness filters using national claims data. This provides a “gold standard” of longitudinal data where patients' complete medical histories are known during the periods in which they were enrolled in the insurance plan. After partitioning the data by provider groups to model gaps in EHR data, we will test how well data completeness filters, individually and in combined machine learning models, select patients with fewer gaps. We will then test whether the filters introduce biases by selecting sicker patients (more diagnoses, more visits, etc.) or changing their demographic characteristics (age, sex, and zip code). Then, we will test the filters on EHR data, first at a single large medical center, and then across a national network of 57 institutions, representing different geographic regions, patient populations, number of years of data, and types of health care facilities. We will evaluate the filters by measuring whether they improve the performance of a machine learning model for predicting hospital admissions. Our ultimate goals are to (a) help researchers balance the need for complete data with the biases this might introduce to their models and (b) help them predict how well models trained on one EHR dataset might work on other EHRs with different data completeness profiles.

"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The proposed research and career development plan are relevant to public health because health care- associated infections (HAIs) affect about one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $30 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. The objective of this project is to develop robust and portable automated surveillance toolkit that combines structured EHR data with rich information locked in clinical notes using natural language processing to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. The proposed research has the potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring of numerous hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale.",Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections,9928343,K08HS025776,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2020,160164,0.03694961791048721
"4/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will substantially advance our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders.

"Operationalizing Machine Learning and Discrete Event Simulation Models to Improve Clinic Efficiency PROJECT SUMMARY Physicians often report feeling pressured to see more patients to maintain revenue, while having less available time for patient care. Systematic data-driven methods for efficiently scheduling patients are important as physicians are pressured to see more and more patients. We propose that real time prediction models of patient visit lengths, the likelihood of missing appointments, and of patient wait times will help schedule patients more efficiently. Clinics will be able to safely overbook to avoid empty slots from missed appointments, have guidance for scheduling urgent add-on patients, and provide wait time estimates for patients when there are delays. We will develop methodologies for accessing data needed for these predictions in real time and propose that the integration of these models into workflows will improve scheduling accuracy, patient wait time, and patient satisfaction, while also increasing clinic volumes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Physicians report feeling pressured to see more patients to maintain revenue, while having less available time for patient care. Machine learning and discrete event simulation model predictions can help schedule patients more efficiently, but need to be integrated into the EHR and scheduling workflows to be effective.

"Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics ABSTRACT Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgical procedure in the nation. Despite the high procedure volume, the evidence base for TJA procedures and associated interventions are limited. This is mainly due to lack of high quality data sources and the logistical difficulties associated with manually extracting TJA information from the unstructured text of the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of EHR and the advances in health information technology offer the potential to transform unstructured EHR notes into structured, codified format that can then be analyzed and shared with local and national arthroplasty registries and other agencies. We therefore propose to leverage unique data resources and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to build an informatics infrastructure for automated EHR data extraction and analysis. We will (1) develop a high performance, externally validated and user centric NLP- enabled algorithm for extraction of complex TJA-specific data elements from the structured and unstructured text of the EHR, (2) validate the algorithm externally in multiple EHR platforms and hospital settings, and (3) conduct a demonstration project focused on prediction of prosthetic joint infections using data elements collected by the NLP-enabled algorithm. Our overarching goal is to develop valid, open source and portable NLP-enabled data collection and risk prediction tools and disseminate them widely to hospitals participating in regional and national TJA registries. This research is significant as it leverages strong data resources and expertise to tackle the pressing need for high quality data and accurate prediction models in TJA. Automated data collection and processing capabilities will lead to an upsurge in secondary use of EHR to advance scientific knowledge on TJA risk factors, healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Accurate prediction of high risk patients for prosthetic joint infections will guide prevention and treatment decisions resulting in significant health benefits to TJA patients. The research is innovative because TJA-specific bioinformatics technology will shift TJA research from current under-powered, single-center studies to large, multi-center registry-based observational studies and clinical trials. Our deliverables have the potential to exert a sustained downstream effect on future TJA research, practice and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Lack of high quality data is a critical barrier to progress in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) research. We will utilize health information technology to automate extraction of rich TJA information from the electronic health records, and develop a robust risk prediction score for prosthetic joint infections, a devastating and yet preventable complication of TJA. Widespread adoption of these tools will enhance data collection capabilities and enable affordable large scale studies for practice improvements through secondary use of real-world data. Accurate prediction of post- operative infection risk among TJA candidates will guide individualized preventive strategies for modifiable risk factors, thereby reducing the burden of prosthetic joint infections in TJA patients.",Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics,9880374,R01AR073147,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guide prevention', 'Health Benefit', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'age group', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'joint infection', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'portability', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'willingness']",NIAMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,592632,0.03434632721759587
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2 million patients at Vanderbilt (including 10,000 genotyped statin recipients) to answer these questions.",Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort,9881338,R01HL133786,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Breast', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataract', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Colorectal', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prostate', 'Qi', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer risk', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'glutaryl coA', 'individual response', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'pleiotropism', 'response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,395483,0.05045943818393119

"Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology PROJECT SUMMARY Healthcare has changed rapidly in the last decade with the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) and the creation of national EHR-based data networks that aim to improve the quality of care. The American College of Rheumatology's RISE registry is a federally Qualified Clinical Data Registry that collects EHR data from the practices of almost 1000 rheumatologists nationally, analyzes these data centrally, and continuously feeds back performance on quality measures to practices via a web-based dashboard. In this K24 proposal, the applicant proposes to utilize novel methods in clinical informatics to increase the accuracy of quality measurement, while also developing and testing new EHR-based quality measures relevant to rheumatic diseases. The proposed research will leverage her strong research portfolio, including grants from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, her successful track record of achieving national endorsement for EHR-based quality measures, existing data from over 1.4 million patients in the RISE database, and the outstanding institutional environment at the University of California, San Francisco. It will also support her ongoing career development in clinical informatics methods relevant to EHR-based clinical research. For this five year K24 award proposal, she plans to increase the time spent mentoring junior investigators in the field or quality and outcomes measurement in rheumatology, with the goal of helping trainees successfully launch academic research careers in patient- oriented research. Aligned with a comprehensive mentoring plan, the proposal outlines two specific aims, including using natural language processing to increase the accuracy of EHR-based quality measurement in RISE, and developing and validating new, prototype electronic clinical quality measures to monitor and address high impact gaps in care for patients with rheumatic disease. The work will prioritize outcome measures and use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model and Health Quality Measures Format to develop, specify and test measures. Measures developed through this research and mentoring program will be candidates for nationwide dissemination across rheumatology practices to improve care for individuals with rheumatic disease.

"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9994228,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data harmonization', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics tool', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'pharmacovigilance', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2020,618291,0.09988432300199372
"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD Project Summary This NHLBI K01 application supports the career development of Dr. Nrupen A. Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data.

"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9963407,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individual response', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'patient response', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,340616,0.040023372740563765
"SCH: INT Re-envisioned Chat-assessment for Real-time Investigating of Nursing and Guidance  Two decades have lapsed since the seminal publications of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine), To Err Is Human and Crossing the Quality Chasm, cast a national spotlight on health-care safety and quality, yet US patient outcome indices continue to lag behind those in other industrialized countries. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act mandated health-care providers adopt electronic health record (EHR) systems, leading to widespread EHR adoption, albeit primarily for billing purposes rather than research or quality improvement efforts. Thus EHR impact on health-care quality has tended to be in the domains of physician efficiency and guideline compliance. Despite a large body of evidence that nursing quality is directly related to patient outcomes in the acute care selling, nurses often lack timely information to use in improving individual patient outcomes, and indices of outcomes across patient populations are slow to budge over lime. Widespread adoption of EHRs in U.S. hospitals now allows determination of outcome quality indicators for all patients in a hospital for real-time feedback to nurses. Quality indicators are often only determined by piecing together other information to determine occurrence of an incident, e.g., exhuming information buried in nursing notes. The goal is to develop Chart-assessment for Real-lime Investigation of Nursing and Guidance (CARING), an automated machine learning system to report and predict nursing quality indicators in real-time for hospitalized patients to assist nurses in care planning. CARI NG will reflect algorithmic innovations to mine sequential patterns from multi-sourced, heterogeneous data including nursing narratives, yielding robust predictive models that are insensitive to uncertain labels and evolve with changes in health-care practices. CARING will represent EHR data using inter-connected tensors, capturing higher-order relations, temporal weighting, i.e., more recent data receives more weight, and incorporating domain expert feedback in development. Although CARING will be developed initially for the ten hospitals of our industry partner Emory Healthcare, its flexible refinement will enable adaptation at other health-care institutions. Outcomes of this project will give nurses actionable data in real time to improve nursing care quality that they do not receive now. Moreover, this system can be implemented into the health information infrastructure at an institutional level, integrating multi-scale and multi-level clinical, contextual, and organizational data surrounding each patient for real-time reporting and incorporation into predictive models. CARING supports the National Library of Medicine mission 1) by creating an innovative open source suite of tools for advancing patient safety; and 2) through educational efforts: training graduate students and fellows, and developing a Massive Open Online Course (MOOG), ""Big Data Analytics for Nursing,"" covering topics at the confluence of computer science, nursing, and patient outcome quality indicators. CARING will improve nursing care quality and make direct, positive impacts on patients, their families, and caregivers.",SCH: INT Re-envisioned Chat-assessment for Real-time Investigating of Nursing and Guidance ,10018103,R01LM013323,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family Caregiver', 'Feedback', 'Fees', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Nurse Administrator', 'Nurses', 'Nurses Performance Evaluations', 'Nursing Informatics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'School Nursing', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Weight', 'Work', 'acute care', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'design', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'health care quality', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'massive open online courses', 'multimodality', 'nursing care quality', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vector']",NLM,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,239104,0.049089498578795604
"A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) is expected to triple by 2050, contributing to decreased quality of life, increased medical care utilization, and additional burden on an already stressed primary care system. Many clinicians lack confidence to assess, diagnose and manage cognitive impairment (CI), and more than 50% of patients with CI are undiagnosed. Unfortunately, studies show that even in settings with high rates of standardized CI screening, very few patients who screen positive have documentation of any clinician follow-up action. To address these important problems, in phase 1 (R61) of this project, we will develop and validate a machine learning model (called MC-PLUS) using results from brief Mini- Cog (MC) screens completed routinely at Annual Medicare Wellness exams and electronic health record (EHR) data to identify patients at elevated risk of a future dementia diagnosis (AD/ADRD). We will also develop and validate a web-based and EHR-integrated CI clinical decision support (CI-CDS) system to engage patients and clinicians in conversation about elevated dementia risk, and to give clinicians the confidence and tools they need to diagnose and manage CI. Both MC-PLUS and the CI-CDS system will be added into an existing web-based CDS platform that has high use rates and primary care clinician satisfaction, and is already seamlessly integrated within the EHR. This CDS platform improves outcomes for patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and high cardiovascular risk as shown in published studies. We will systematically validate the CI-CDS system with expert champions prior to conducting a pilot test at one primary care clinic. After milestones for success are demonstrated, we will begin phase 2 (R33), a large pragmatic trial with 30 primary care clinics randomized to receive CI-CDS or usual care (UC). We will evaluate change in clinician confidence in CI detection and care management in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. If successful, the CI-CDS system will improve rates of new CI diagnosis and narrow existing sociodemographic disparities in adults with elevated dementia risk identified by MC-PLUS at index visit in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. We will evaluate the impact of the intervention on care management and care plans using EHR data and chart audits. We will assess determinants of clinician actions in response to the CDS system using behavior change theory and technology acceptance constructs, and conduct phone surveys of patient and caregiver dyads to evaluate intervention effects on feelings of preparedness for decision making and distress. The CI-CDS system is immediately scalable to large numbers of patients through the existing non-commercialized CDS platform already in use for millions of patients in care systems spanning 14 states. The CDS system implemented as described could maximize return on massive investments that have been made in EHR systems, and provide a prototype to rapidly and consistently translate evolving evidence-based CI guidelines into personalized CI care and guidance within primary care. Project Narrative Most experts advocate for early detection of cognitive impairment (CI) so that patients and caregivers can be prepared for making difficult decisions and to improve quality of life, but studies show that screening alone isn’t sufficient to change clinician actions related to early detection. Using predictive modelling developed with machine learning methods and sophisticated clinical decision support (CDS) tools, it is possible to identify patients at elevated risk for CI and make it much easier for primary care to engage and support patients and caregivers in meaningful care planning. In this project, we implement and evaluate a low-cost, highly scalable CI-CDS system integrated within the electronic health record that has high potential to improve early CI detection and care and translate massive public and private sector investments in health informatics into tangible health benefits for large numbers of people.",A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment,10092423,R61AG069770,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Expenditures', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Printing', 'Private Sector', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suggestion', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Theory of Change', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care systems', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'personalized care', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual']",NIA,HEALTHPARTNERS INSTITUTE,R61,2020,592048,0.005984226107402179
"National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms PROJECT SUMMARY With the rapidly growing adoption of patient electronic health record systems (EHRs) due to Meaningful Use, and linkage of EHRs to research biorepositories, evaluating the suitability of EHR data for clinical and translational research is becoming ever more important, with ramifications for genomic and observational research, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness studies. A key component for identifying patient cohorts in the EHR is to define inclusion and exclusion criteria that algorithmically select sets of patients based on stored clinical data. This process is commonly referred to, as “EHR-driven phenotyping” is time-consuming and tedious due to the lack of a widely accepted and standards-based formal information model for defining phenotyping algorithms. To address this overall challenge, the proposed project will design, build and promote an open-access community infrastructure for standards-based development and sharing of phenotyping algorithms, as well as provide tools and resources for investigators, researchers and their informatics support staff to implement and execute the algorithms on native EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of patient cohorts for clinical and genomic research is a costly and time-consuming process. This bottleneck adversely affects public health by delaying research findings, and in some cases by making research costs prohibitively high. To address this issue, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) for identifying patient cohorts has become an increasingly attractive option.

"Efficient Statistical Learning Methods for Personalized Medicine Using Large Scale Biomedical Data Project Summary/Abstract  Current medical treatment guidelines largely rely on data from randomized controlled trials that study  average effects, which may be inadequate for making individualized decisions for real-world patients. Large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) data provide unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized treatment strategies and generate evidence relevant to real-world patients. However, there are inherent challenges in the use of EHRs, including non-experimental nature of data collection processes, heterogeneous data types with complex dependencies, irregular measurement patterns, multiple dynamic treatment sequences, and the need to balance risk and benefit of treatments. Using two high-quality EHR databases, Columbia University Medical Center's clinical data warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care database, and focusing on type 2 diabetes (T2D), this proposal will develop novel and scalable statistical learning approaches that overcome these challenges to discover optimal personalized treatment strategies for T2D from real-world patients. Specifically, under Aim 1, we will develop a unified framework to learn latent temporal processes for feature extraction and dynamic patient records representation. Our approach will accommodate large-scale variables of mixed types (continuous, binary, counts) measured at irregular intervals. They extract lower-dimensional components to reflect patients' dynamic health status, account for informative healthcare documentation processes, and characterize similarities between patients. Under Aim 2, we will develop fast and efficient multi-category machine learning methods, in order to evaluate treatment propensities and adaptively learn optimal dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) among the extensive number of treatment options observed in the EHRs. The methods will provide  sequential decisions that determine the best treatment sequence for a T2D patient given his/her EHRs. Under Aim 3, we will develop statistical learning methods to assist multi-faceted treatment decision-making, which balances risks versus benefits when evaluating a DTR. Our approach will ensure maximizing benefit to the greatest extent while controlling all risk outcomes under the safety margins. For all aims, we will develop efficient stochastic resampling algorithms to scale up the optimization for massive data sizes. We will identify optimal DTRs for T2D using the extracted information from patients' comorbidity conditions, medications, and laboratory tests, as well as records-collection processes. Our methodologies will be applied and cross-validated between the two EHR databases. The treatment strategies learned from the representative EHR databases with a diverse patient  population will be beneficial for individual patient care, assisting clinicians to adaptively choose the optimal treatment for a patient. Finally, we will disseminate our methods and results through freely available software and outreach to the informatics and clinical experts at our Centers for Translational Science and elsewhere. Project Narrative  This proposal aims to develop novel and scalable statistical learning methods to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) and use two real-world, high-quality EHR databases for personalized medicine research. The methods will handle the non-experimental nature of data collection processes, along with heterogeneous data types, dynamic treatment sequences, and the trade-off between benefit and risk outcomes.

"2/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric diorders Abstract  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. In particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 25,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,200 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials. If individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be identified early, it might be possible to find more effective treatments for them.

"Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions Project Summary  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) are morbid immunologic reactions to drugs that confer a mortality of 10-50%. Over the last decade, significant promise for prediction and prevention has come from the discovery that many SCARs are associated with variation within HLA class I alleles. For HLA-B*15:02, this has led to routine pre-prescription screening for carbamazepine in many Southeast Asian countries and a significant reduction in cases of carbamazepine SJS/TEN. Despite this progress, there is little known about genetic and epidemiological risk factors for SCARs related to commonly used drugs such as antibiotics. There is also limited information about HLA risk for SCARs across the diverse populations present in the United States. Furthermore, imprecision of clinical phenotyping and lack of standardized coding has led to challenges in finding SCAR cases in the electronic health record (EHR). Our proposed study aims to address critical challenges and gaps in our knowledge of antibiotic SCARs.  In Aim 1, we will leverage advanced informatics and longitudinal EHR data for over 11 million patients from Partners HealthCare System since the 1980s to identify SCAR cases. We will create, optimize and standardize reproducible methods for finding SCAR cases and validating a cohort of SCAR patients. This iterative process will be used to refine and disseminate an electronic phenotype to be validated cross-institutionally.  In Aim 2, we will analyze SCAR prevalence and conduct a case-control study to identify drug-specific and patient-specific risk factors for antibiotic-associated SCARs. We will compare clinical sequelae, quality of life and adherence of SCAR patients compared to controls through validated survey instruments.  In Aim 3, we will identify candidate HLA and genetic associations from patients with validated antibiotic- associated SCARs. We will examine difference in genetic risk in minority and health disparity populations and predict that we will be powered to establish HLA associations for vancomycin DRESS (i.e., drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) and sulfonamide antimicrobial and beta-lactam SCAR. HLA alone, or in combination with clinical risk factors, can lead to improved SCAR prevention and early diagnosis. We will establish a data sharing platform, in the form of an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.  The roadmap we develop will translate into the development of electronic phenotypes for serious adverse drug reactions that facilitate genetic discovery. Knowledge gained will be crucial to the translation of genetic data into clinical decision making. This is in close alignment with NIH’s research mission to accelerate genetic discovery for iatrogenic and preventable drug-induced diseases that will translate into prevention, earlier diagnosis and an enhanced mechanistic understanding that may lead to targeted therapeutic approaches. Narrative  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) result in substantial morbidity, long term disability, health care burden and a mortality of 10-50%. To advance the science of clinical and genetic risk factor identification for antibiotic SCAR, we will leverage large electronic health record (EHR) data and advanced informatics technology. Through case validation we will create an informatics roadmap for other institutions with similar EHR data to identify SCAR cases and we will establish a data sharing platform, including an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.",Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions,10018800,R01AI150295,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Allopurinol', 'Antibiotics', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biological Markers', 'Carbamazepine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Country', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Administration Routes', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eosinophilia', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Female', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monobactams', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nevirapine', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Sulfonamides', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin', 'Variant', 'abacavir', 'adverse drug reaction', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'care burden', 'case control', 'case finding', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'health disparity', 'immunoreaction', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'sex', 'sharing platform', 'southeast Asian', 'targeted treatment']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,696239,0.050659762788626286
"Unravelling genetic basis of comorbidity using EHR-linked biobank data Rapid progress in translational bioinformatics and clinical informatics for precision medicine has  provided many computing and informatics methodologies to provide better prediction, diagnosis and  treatment strategy as a clinical utility. In particular, high dimensional and large-scale  biomedical data sets, ranging from clinical data to ‘omics data, provide an unprecedented  opportunity for translating the newly found knowledge from biomedical big data analytics to  support clinical decisions. The complexity and scale of these big data sets hold great  promise, yet present substantial challenges. As one of important concerns for clinicians,  comorbidity is a well- documented phenomenon in medicine in which one or more medical conditions  exist and potentially interact with one another, thereby influencing the primary clinical  condition. Several studies show variability in the number of comorbid conditions that can  exist at one time, and patterns of disease presentation differ from one chronic condition to  another. Thus, there is a clear need to improve care for individuals with multiple  comorbidities, but doing so requires a much more detailed understanding of the trends of disease  associations than we currently possess. Previous studies have primarily focused on a  handful of specific comorbidities; investigating the underlying causes of broad disease  comorbidity across the human diseasome has been challenging. Fortunately, in the past  decade, comprehensive collections of disease diagnosis data have become available, primarily  in the form of data from electronic health records (EHRs). Retrospectively, we can use a patient’s  health history to identify comorbidities and apply a data-driven approach to studying disease  comorbidity patterns that considers all possible disease comorbidities. In particular, developing  computing and modeling of large-scale data that integrates newly defined comorbidity patterns with  genomics will hold great potential for uncovering molecular mechanisms of disease. Primarily, we  will elucidate the underlying genetic and non-genetic factors that influence disease comorbidity.  We will apply two orthogonal approaches to identify comorbidities: 1) deriving from disease  co-occurrence using EHR data alone, and 2) deriving from pleiotropic genetic associations using the  EHR-linked biobank dataset. Network-based approaches have the potential to uncover unexpected  relationships between diseases. One of the most significant advantages of our proposal is the  linking of a single-source EHR to genomic data; this provides the opportunity to  revisit individual-level genotype and phenotype data for the design of more targeted  studies and to ask more specific questions. Additionally, our results can be used to develop  a novel comorbidity risk score that combines both clinical data and genetic effects, which might  constitute a new tool for clinical prevention and monitoring. These goals are very much in keeping  with today’s climate of precision medicine, where treatment and prevention are ideally designed to  consider an individual patient’s variability in genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. There is a clear need to improve care for individuals with multiple comorbidities, but this  requires a much more detailed understanding of the trends of disease associations than we  currently possess. An EHR-linked biobank data provides a unique opportunity to investigate  cross-phenotypes associations, and it might broaden the understanding of genetic architecture  that exists between diagnoses, genes, and pleiotropy. In this proposal, we will construct a  disease comorbidity map of 2.1 million patients using longitudinal EHRs in Penn Medicine (Aim 1),  construct a disease-gene map derived from phenome-wide association study using Penn Medicine  Biobank Participants (Aim 2), and develop a novel scoring system using graph-based  machine learning and predict comorbidity risk scores (CRS) for a given disease (Aim 3).",Unravelling genetic basis of comorbidity using EHR-linked biobank data,10034691,R01GM138597,"['Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biobank', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'electronic data', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interactive tool', 'large scale data', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'patient variability', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'trend']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,486125,0.035209692381439534
"Clinical and Translational Science Award PROJECT SUMMARY: COMBATCOVID The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every corner of the globe and has redefined healthcare throughout the United States. COVID-19 cases in the New York City tri-state area have reached an extraordinarily high number and have quickly become the epicenter region of the crisis in the United States. In New York State alone, there are over 372,000 confirmed cases as of June 1, 2020. NYU Langone Health (NYULH) has been particularly hard hit, with more than 8,100 COVID-19 hospitalizations to date. In response, the entire clinical research community is marshalling resources in an attempt to improve our understanding of how the virus spreads, how it infects various tissues in the body, which patients are more susceptible to infection and fatal outcomes, which therapeutics improve symptoms and survival, whether the immune response confers long-lasting protection against reinfection, and many other crucially important questions. The complexity of the development of this disease and unpredictability of progression into severity, as well as the variety of phenotypic outcomes observed during and post COVID-19, pose major challenges in understanding, predicting, preventing, managing and treating this disease and its sequelae. Answers to these challenges can only be achieved through the comprehensive analysis of a significantly high number of COVID cases. Given how recent and unknown this disease is, and its inherent epidemic nature, there is a limited number of cases at individual medical institutions. The limitation of number of cases per institution becomes even more relevant when isolating subpopulations with specific health conditions and across the lifespan. This proposed study will aim to overcome the above-mentioned challenges by supporting the formation of a consortium comprising multiple medical institutions in the U.S.: COMBATCOVID (Consortium for Multisite Biomedical Analytics and Trials on COVID-19). COMBATCOVID will bring together electronic health records (EHR) data from multiple participating institutions into a shared centralized database. As part of the COMBATCOVID effort, biorepository data of COVID-19 patients collected by some of the participating institutions will also be shared and linked to the respective EHR data. The COMBATCOVID consortium will be responsible for transferring EHR data pertaining to participating institutions interested in contributing EHR data to the N3C database. PROJECT NARRATIVE: COMBATCOVID The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every corner of the globe and has redefined healthcare throughout the United States. To adequately understand the virus much more data is needed, necessitating sharing of data across multiple institutions.

"Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics PROJECT SUMMARY The widespread adoption of EHRs has enabled the collection of massive amounts of digital ophthalmic data which have great potential for secondary use in research, quality improvement, and clinical decision support. While the amount of digital ophthalmic data recorded in the EHR is substantial and could be analyzed using the latest techniques for big data, questions about the quality of the data are a barrier to its reuse. Now that the American Academy of Ophthalmology has aggregated digital ophthalmic data from the EHR into the IRIS Registry, data quality is even more imperative for reaching the potential of the registry. To date, there has not be a comprehensive evaluation of the data quality of digital ophthalmic data, nor have there been any solutions for improving its quality. These are important gaps that will limit the utility of EHR data as a tool for knowledge discovery in ophthalmology. The goal of this grant is to assess the quality of digital ophthalmic exam data in order to improve its ability to be reused for research. Our hypothesis is that studying the variability of data quality in large datasets will provide insights into improving its quality. The first aim employs an established framework for data quality analysis to assess the intrinsic quality of a single institution’s EHR data as well as its fitness for use--the ability to be applied to a particular research scenario. In this proposal, we are evaluating the data’s ability to identify patient cohorts for clinical trials and to accurately calculate outcome based clinical quality measures. The variability in data’s quality and fitness among providers, subspecialties, diagnoses, and visit types will be analyzed. The second aim validates the analysis of the first aim by repeating it for all of the ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry. For this analysis, the differences in quality and fitness between institutions and EHR vendors will also be assessed, along with the barriers to data quality and reuse. For both aims, ophthalmology experts will review the results to make recommendations for improving data quality and utility for digital ophthalmic data. In the future, these recommendations will provide a direction for correcting these quality issues and for ultimately advancing knowledge discovery in ophthalmic care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) have not yet reached their potential for transforming healthcare, particularly for reusing clinical data for research. The American Academy of Ophthalmology has aggregated ophthalmic data from the EHR into the IRIS Registry, and data quality is even more imperative to achieve to reach the potential of this registry. Using methodological data quality analysis, we will analyze the quality of a single institution’s ophthalmic data and again for multiple institutions’ ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry, documenting barriers for data quality and reuse that will lead to improving knowledge discovery from this data.",Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics,9953684,R21EY031443,"['Academy', 'Adoption', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Exfoliation Syndrome', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Iris', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Ophthalmology', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Secondary to', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'cohort', 'data framework', 'data harmonization', 'data quality', 'data registry', 'data reuse', 'data submission', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'research study', 'tool', 'treatment comparison']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,231000,0.06414786130876027
"Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data PROJECT SUMMARY Large electronic health record research (EHR) data integrated with -omics data from linked biorepositories have expanded opportunities for precision medicine research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized cancer risk and progression prediction models, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice and ultimately realize the promise of precision oncology. However, efficiently and effectively using EHR for cancer research remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, obtaining precise event time information such as time of cancer recurrence is a major bottleneck in using EHR for precision medicine research due to the requirement of laborious medical record review and the lack of documentation. Simple estimates of the event time based on billing or procedure codes may poorly approximate the true event time. Naive use of such estimated event times can lead to highly biased estimates due to the approximation error. Such biases impose challenges to performing pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time to events and captured using EHR. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill these methodological gaps in risk assessment for cancer research using EHR data, which will advance our ability to achieve the promise of precision oncology. Statistical algorithms and software will be developed to (i) automatically assign event time information using longitudinally recorded EHR information; and (ii) to perform accurate risk assessment using noisy proxies of event times. The proposed tools for risk assessment using imperfect EHR data without requiring extensive manual chart review could greatly improve the utility of EHR for oncology research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses major methodological gaps in effectively utilizing EHR data for risk assessment due to the noisy nature of EHR data. We propose novel statistical algorithms and software to (i) efficiently annotate event time by combining multiple longitudinally recorded code information and (ii) to provide precise risk estimates using noisy proxies of event times. By drawing upon the rich albeit imperfect data from bio-repository linked EHR, our algorithms will advance our ability to use EHR data for precision oncology research.",Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data,9955220,R21CA242940,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Boston', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proxy', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'adjudicate', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2020,177510,0.12208533676541097
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients. The proposed work will have a significant impact on clinical management of FH patients.",EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia,9938607,R01HL135879,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Awareness', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Europe', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Lipoprotein (a)', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Primary Prevention', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Xanthomas', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care providers', 'case-based', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'epidemiology study', 'evaluation/testing', 'family burden', 'genetic testing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'lifetime risk', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'point of care', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'premature', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening program', 'shared decision making', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,638566,0.0972630644228474
"Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For epidemiological studies, future clinical trials, and personalized patient care, there is a critical need to create a risk-stratification system for microbial keratitis. Microbial keratitis (MK), a debilitating, infectious corneal disease, is estimated to be the fourth-leading cause of blindness worldwide. MK severity depends on a complex interaction of patient, organism, and environment, resulting in a spectrum of clinical presentations and responses to treatment. Clinical presentations manifest with unique morphology features and clinical symptoms. Morphology features are visible in the cornea, and symptoms are measurable. But most patients are treated with non-specific broad-spectrum antimicrobials, an approach that increases antimicrobial resistance. This non-specific treatment approach lacks congruence with the unique MK presentations. There is a critical need for a new strategy to personalize treatments for MK and measure treatment efficacy. With quantified MK morphologic and clinical features, clinicians will have the tools to risk-stratify patients. The long-term goal is to develop rapid, objective, personalized treatment plans for patients with MK. This proposal’s objective is to quantify dynamic morphologic and clinical MK features using image and electronic health record (EHR) analyses and then build a risk-stratification scoring system associated with MK outcomes. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that morphologic and clinical features accurately risk- stratify patients for corneal and vision outcomes. Our premise is supported by preliminary data demonstrating that: (1) different organisms generate distinct morphologic and clinical features; (2) clinicians quantify morphology less precisely than image-analysis methods, (3) an expert is able to use MK features to tailor treatments; (4) the use of quantified features has improved outcomes in other diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, by helping providers to tailor treatments; (5) EHR data can be used to quantify and classify clinical disease features accurately; and (6) EHR data can be used effectively to risk-stratify patients. Aim 1 will develop objective image analysis tools to measure features of MK with existing clinical equipment. Aim 2 will evaluate MK treatment efficacy using morphologic image analysis and clinical features from prospective surveys. Aim 3 will risk-stratify patients with MK by combining image analysis and EHR extracted data. The expected outcomes are: (1) characterized databases of MK images and linked clinical data, (2) quantified MK features across a spectrum of clinical presentations, (3) performance-tested, open-source imaging algorithms and surveys to measure MK markers dynamically, and (4) a novel risk stratification model and scoring system. The resultant work will have significant value to clinicians. Clinicians can use practical, low-cost technologies and readily-available EHR data to quantify MK features and risk-stratify patients in order to tailor treatments. NARRATIVE The clinical management of microbial keratitis is imprecise and dependent on the expertise of the treating physician. Our innovative strategies will quantify corneal features using image analysis and available clinical data from the electronic health record. Quantified image features will be linked to health outcomes to give physicians new tools to risk-stratify patients and to tailor their management to optimize outcomes.",Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach,9865483,R01EY031033,"['Algorithms', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inflammatory', 'Keratitis', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Eye Institute', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Self-Examination', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Virulence', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'care systems', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'epidemiology study', 'healing', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'performance tests', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'slit lamp imaging', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,410000,0.050446493773033445
"Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa Project Summary Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a neglected, prevalent, chronic, stigmatizing, and debilitating disease that has recently been prioritized for study by NIAMS. Evidence suggests that some HS patients choose to self-manage symptoms remaining unconnected to healthcare, and some seek medical care for repeated outbreaks of boils but never receive a diagnosis. Such ‘hidden populations’ create challenges for designing research studies that are generalizable. Precision medicine initiatives and resources offer opportunities to rapidly increase our knowledge about biological causes of HS and to improve the care that HS patients receive. For example, the NIH has made considerable investments in the development of data repositories that link genetic data to EHR for hundreds of thousands of patients, including the NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network and the NIH-funded All of Us Research Program. Columbia University investigators are integral members of these nationwide programs, both as a recruitment site, as well as a data and research center (5U01HG008680, 1OT2OD026556). Engaging research participants who are willing to contribute longitudinal data is a major obstacle to precision medicine initiatives. The public’s use of the Internet and social media to obtain and exchange health-related information has created opportunities to rapidly and efficiently assemble large longitudinal cohorts, yet there are important differences from traditional research methods and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Columbia University is at the forefront of the development and application of these methods. A major challenge to implementing precision medicine arises from patients who share a diagnosis but have different biological causes of disease. HS patients have a high burden of comorbidities and we hypothesize that sets of comorbidities that tend to present together in individual patients can be used to identify biologically relevant disease subtypes. Here we will use three approaches to identify patterns of comorbidities within patients, to characterize the generalizability of the results from studies conducted in EHR, and to use genetic data to biologically validate comorbidities and resolve causality underlying disease associations. Training in biomedical informatics and Internet-based survey research will allow the applicant to use EHR data and Internet resources for assembling cohorts to conduct these studies, and complement her previous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, molecular biology and human genetics, providing fluency across several domains that are crucial for advancing precision medicine initiatives. Completion of this proposal will achieve the applicant’s long-term goal of obtaining advanced training aimed at implementing precision medicine in the treatment of skin disease. Project Narrative This project addresses the imperative needs of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) patients who suffer from pain, stigma, diminished quality of life, decreased work productivity, and increased healthcare costs that arise from managing a difficult-to-treat, debilitating disease with a high burden of comorbidities. We will conduct studies of HS comorbidities to identify biologically distinct subclasses of HS in large samples of patients using data in electronic health records and data collected from Internet surveys. This work will improve the precision of HS diagnoses and set up the infrastructure for future large-scale studies of HS.",Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa,9977561,K01AR075111,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Anogenital region', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axilla', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Furuncles', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inguinal region', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Stigmatization', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'online resource', 'patient engagement', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'research study', 'skin disorder', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'symptom self management', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2020,121288,0.02371368781582474
