"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features. The training and pilot data will be necessary for Dr. Dreizin’s long- term goal of research independence and R01 support to develop automated segmentation algorithms for the spectrum of clinically important imaging features after pelvic trauma, as well as fully automated multivariable clinical prediction tools with potential for translation to industry and as an FDA-cleared product. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement. We propose to develop automated software for hemorrhage-detection, and real-time risk prediction software for major arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures.",Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures,9819865,K08EB027141,"['Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arterial Injury', 'Award', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Caliber', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Crush Injury', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Extravasation', 'Fall injury', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maryland', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability Theory', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shorthand', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Vehicle crash', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse outcome', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer infrastructure', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'heuristics', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle form', 'neural network architecture', 'outcome prediction', 'pelvis fracture', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'radiologist', 'random forest', 'real time model', 'secondary outcome', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K08,2019,186183,0.011130654121666365
"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,9748523,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biopsy', 'Breast biopsy', 'Bypass', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interventional Ultrasonography', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver diseases', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Needles', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'North America', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readability', 'Resolution', 'Retroperitoneal Space', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgical Instruments', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fetal', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,195128,0.013606083772774813
"TOPIC 389 - INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING Besides surgery, radiotherapy is the most effective treatment modality for localized prostate cancer. The success of radiotherapy stems from the exploit of a therapeutic window in tumor response and normal tissue tolerance which maximizes the chance of sterilizing the tumor while sparing the surrounding normal tissue from severe damage. This requires an accurate and individualized radiation dose distribution generated from the examination of the patient’s medical images. Radiation therapy is technically complex and labor intensive. Intensive human supervision and intervention are needed throughout the path of patient care.   Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are adept at automating workflows and tasks—in this case the development of cancer treatment plans. We believe that this machine learning has incredible potential to address inherent problems in the existing treatment planning workflow. Our approach will mitigate the current issues with treatment planning, integrate seamlessly with day-to-day operations, and will serve as a treatment solution that benefits patients in a way that limits their risk and extends their lives.   The goal of this project is to develop a start-to-end prostate cancer treatment planning system. We will work with three expert radiation oncology teams to archive existing patient data for use in training of artificial intelligence algorithms. These algorithms will enable high quality plans to be generated with ease. At the completion of Phase I, we will have a prototype interface that will allow users to create treatment plans and segmentation using artificial intelligence algorithms. Additionally, users will be able to evaluate these plans against other expert plans and against the training data. n/a",TOPIC 389 - INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING,10027492,5N91019C00053,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Patient', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Pythons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'data reduction', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'web interface']",NCI,"RADIASOFT, LLC",N43,2019,300000,-0.02057146205024231
"Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors Project Summary/Abstract One of the key advances in modern positron emission tomography (PET) systems for clinical imaging is the use of time-of-flight (TOF) information. In cancer imaging TOF provides superior lesion detection and more accurate quantification that is crucial in measuring response to therapy, as well as in neurological and cardiovascular imaging applications. An additional benefit of TOF is the ability to lower the radiation dose or scan time without sacrificing image quality, important for patient safety and comfort. The magnitude of these clinical benefits is determined by the TOF resolution of the PET detectors, therefore the prospect of achieving unprecedented image quality and clinical imaging capabilities with superior TOF resolution has fueled significant research in developing detector technology for TOF-PET systems. However, these developments have been largely unaccompanied by advances in signal processing methods needed to extract TOF information from the detector’s electrical signals, with most detectors making use of crude analog algorithms that discard most of the useful timing information contained in the signals. Now, with the availability of low-cost fast waveform digitizers, there is an exciting opportunity to implement sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to achieve superior TOF resolution. The main advantage of developing advanced signal processing algorithms is that it presents a cost-effective route to improved TOF resolution that is complementary to instrumentation innovations. In essence, the TOF gain comes for free; the detector signals already contain the information needed for better TOF resolution, it just needs to be used effectively. Here we propose to tailor deep learning techniques to estimate TOF from the detector signals. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a powerful approach to learn complex representations of input data that can be used for tasks such as classification and regression. CNNs are therefore very suitable for directly estimating TOF from the detector waveforms, since these waveforms are influenced by several complex and intertwined processes which are hard to accurately model. Furthermore, large amounts of ground truth training data are readily generated. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of CNN-based TOF estimation, and found up to 23% improvement in TOF resolution compared to standard signal processing methods. This proposal aims to optimize these methods to push the limits of achievable TOF resolution and develop methods for their practical implementation. First, we will develop CNN architectures and methods suitable for silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) that are now used in modern TOF-PET systems. We will also optimize the digitizing parameters to make optimal use of CNNs for TOF estimation. Second, we will implement CNN-TOF methods in a modern commercial PET detector, including using a global CNN to simultaneously estimate TOF and the crystal-of-interaction from the detector waveforms, demonstrating the practical feasibility of using this promising deep learning method in next generation PET systems. Narrative The use of time-of-flight information in positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful way to increase clinical imaging capabilities of PET, and is now used in most modern systems. Improving time-of-flight performance promises to provide substantial benefits for lesion detection in cancer imaging, kinetic modeling with dynamic imaging, and the use of lower radiation dose for patient safety. Here we introduce deep learning signal processing methods to significantly improve the performance of time-of-flight PET detectors without requiring new materials, which thereby represents a cost effective route towards maximizing the use of the rich imaging signal provided by time-of-flight.",Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors,9784818,R03EB027268,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Electronics', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'analog', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'neural network architecture', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'photomultiplier', 'physical process', 'response', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'time use', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2019,78500,0.04204716626080401
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning,9789276,R01EB025220,"['Acetazolamide', 'Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'ImProv', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Japanese Population', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Premenopause', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Spin Labels', 'Stress Tests', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Waste Products', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Xenon', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'cerebrovascular imaging', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'design', 'direct application', 'disability', 'evidence based guidelines', 'gender difference', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'men', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'response', 'stressor', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'time use', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,586260,-0.0684701369559966
"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9783816,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,438449,0.04103053945066021
"Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography (PET) is a high-sensitivity molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, with the ability to observe molecular-level activities inside a living body through the injection of specific radioactive tracers. In addition to the commonly used F-18-FDG, new tracers are being constantly developed and investigated to pinpoint specific pathways in various diseases. New PET scanners are also being proposed by exploiting time of flight (TOF) information, enabling depth of interaction capability, and extending the solid angle coverage. To realize the full potential of the new PET tracers and scanners, there is an increasing need for the development of advanced image reconstruction methods. This grant application proposes a new framework for regularized image reconstruction that synergistically integrates deep learning and regularized image reconstruction. The new framework is enabled by the recent advances in machine learning, which provide a tool to digest vast amount information embedded in existing medical images. The proposed method embeds a pre-trained deep neural network in an iterative image reconstruction framework and uses the deep neural network to regularize PET image directly. By training the deep neural network with a large amount of high-quality low-noise PET images, the proposed method can capture complex prior information from existing inter-subject and intra-subject data and thus is expected to substantially outperform the current state-of-the-art regularized image reconstruction method. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop the theoretical framework to synergistically integrate deep learning in regularized image reconstruction for PET and (2) to implement the proposed method and validate its effectiveness using existing animal data. Once the proposed method is validated using existing animal data, we will seek funding to acquire necessary human data for the implementation of the proposed method on clinical PET scanners. Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique widely used in clinic for detecting cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. This project will develop an innovative image reconstruction method that has potential to improve PET image quality and reduce radiation dose. Its success will improve the accuracy of PET for cancer detection and other diseases.",Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography,9752639,R21EB026668,"['Advanced Development', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radioactive Tracers', 'Rattus', 'Role', 'Solid', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'animal data', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2019,196250,0.025303039569380154
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,9653979,R01CA218187,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,663746,-0.011500104716954888
"Machine Learning in Breast Parenchyma and Tumor Characterization for Cancer Risk Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY We propose a study of radiomic texture analysis in terms of robustness assessment and classification utility. We will introduce novel robustness metrics geared towards assessment of radiomic features in comparison across two image conditions, and apply these metrics to study feature robustness across imaging parameters and patient biology. In addressing the utility of radiomic features in cancer risk assessment, we will identify and evaluate texture signatures from mammography and tomosynthesis datasets. The field of radiomics is evolving fast, and quantitative texture analysis is being applied to a growing number of applications in medical imaging. By performing a thorough investigation of the robustness of these radiomic features to dataset heterogeneities we aim to identify the strengths and weaknesses of commonly used features to guide their implementations on future applications.  Two clinical tasks will be studied under the proposed research: 1) risk assessment and cancer prediction and 2) malignancy evaluation. Multiple modalities including tomosynthesis, mammography and MRI will be involved in studies geared towards addressing these clinical questions. An evaluation of the robustness of commonly employed radiomic features will help guide the field of medical texture analysis and contribute to meaningful conclusions in future studies throughout the field of quantitative image analysis. The first aim of the proposed research involves the proposition and evaluation of novel robustness metrics for investigations lacking a classification task. The second aim will extend the study of radiomics to investigate the utility of robust features in classification tasks and identification of texture signatures relate to biomedical characteristics. The third aim will build upon the two previous aims and culminate in the application of cutting-edge technologies in machine learning and deep learning in further promoting image processing in the field of medical physics. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate and improve the application of radiomic texture features in cancer risk assessment. We will accomplish this by evaluating the robustness of various radiomic metrics, testing the classification utility of texture features in clinical tasks, and extending current classification methods to include cutting-edge developments in machine learning technology. Careful preliminary studies have demonstrated methods for selection of robust texture features and improvement in classification tasks by emphasizing feature robustness in feature selection methodology and we therefore believe that a meticulous evaluation of the impact of imaging parameters on feature calculations will lead to overall improvement of computer-aided diagnosis and clinical translation to progress in cancer screening protocols.",Machine Learning in Breast Parenchyma and Tumor Characterization for Cancer Risk Assessment,9683697,F31CA228247,"['Address', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impact evaluation', 'Incidence', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'expectation', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular subtypes', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'response', 'tomosynthesis', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2019,24304,-0.023545278915709955
"Generalizing Deep Learning Reconstruction for Free-Breathing and Quantitative MRI Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to increase the precision and resolution of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Quantitative information such as tissue relaxation parameters (e.g., T1 and T2) measure tissue function and indicate disease-related changes in the heart, liver, brain, and other organs. For instance, T1 changes can provide evidence of diffuse fibrosis in the myocardium that can signal heart disease. Quantitative maps also are reproducible, directly comparable longitudinally and across subjects, and less affected by the properties of the scanner used, when compared versus common weighted (non-quantitative) clinical imaging. But, quantitative imaging involves more complicated and time-consuming pulse sequences. To accomplish this goal, this project will develop new machine learning algorithms for high-quality parameter mapping from free-breathing data. The first aim of this project will increase parameter map resolution achievable from highly accelerated, noisy data. The proposed method will integrate existing deep cascade network-based image reconstructions with convolutional network-based blocks for super-resolution and parameter map estimation. Preliminary studies suggest these new blocks improve sharpness and mitigate artifacts in the reconstructed parameter maps. The next aim will improve the training precision of such artificial neural networks to account for the significant per-voxel nonlinear fit variability in quantitative MRI. The proposed method will reweight the loss function used for calibrating these networks by the goodness-of-fit (coefficient of determination) of the reference maps obtained from fully sampled training data. Preliminary results demonstrate that quality-aware reweighting significantly improves reconstructed image quality when working with noisy training data. Experiments will evaluate the precision of both of these innovations against existing deep-learning-based reconstructions on T1 maps obtained from pre- and post-contrast cardiac images of volunteer patients. The final aim will address motion during the acquisition by estimating and tracking nonrigid motion in the data consistency stages of the deep cascade artificial neural network architecture. Two methods are proposed: deformable motion estimation already demonstrated on compressive model-based image reconstructions, and a new “re-blurring” convolutional neural network that automatically introduces artifacts into a “clean” image to match the motion-corrupted data. Both of these methods enforce consistency between motion-affected data and a motion-free image during the reconstruction. Both methods will be validated on both cardiac and abdominal images for motion artifacts and reconstruction quality against breath-held parameter mapping acquisitions. Project Narrative Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging noninvasively measures physical properties of tissue connected to cardiovascular disease and many other conditions. Novel machine learning methods for processing data to produce higher quality maps will facilitate earlier and more accurate treatment of these diseases.

"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9745302,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'random forest', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,1,0.0070953223505830785
"Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning Project Summary Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in approximately a third of all MRI scans. The unique relaxation parameters of GBCAs create indispensable image contrast for a wide range of clinical applications, such as angiography and tumor detection. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF can be painful, cause severe disability, and even death. The risk of developing NSF prevents millions of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams. The recent identification of gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised additional safety concerns about the usage of GBCAs. Studies have demonstrated increased signal intensity on the unenhanced T1-weighted MR images that is correlated with previous GBCA exposure, and this gadolinium retention is independent of renal function. While initial reports focused on linear GBCAs, more recent reports show that gadolinium deposition occurs with macrocyclic GBCAs as well, albeit at lower levels. FDA has recently issued warnings about gadolinium retention following contrast-enhanced MRI, and required GBCA manufacturers to conduct human and animal studies to further assess the safety of these contrast agents. This project addresses these concerns by developing low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL). Approach: This fast-track project has two phases and three aims. Aim 1 (Phase I) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using pre-contrast images and contrast-enhanced images acquired with only 10% of standard GBCA dose. A software infrastructure will be constructed to seamlessly integrate the DL software between MR scanners and PACS. Aim 2 (Phase II) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using GBCA-free acquisitions with different image contrast. In Aim 3 (Phase II), we will clinically validate and evaluate both low-dose and zero-dose DL methods, including on patients with mild- to-moderate CKD. Non-inferiority tests and diagnostic performance of the synthesized full-dose images compared to the true full-dose images will be performed. Significance: This work will lead to safer contrast-enhanced MRI. The low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI method will benefit not only millions of patients with advanced CKD, who cannot currently undergo contrast-enhanced MRI, but many more patients with normal kidney function, who are at the risk of gadolinium retention after contrast-enhanced MRI. Project Narrative Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in MRI exams to create indispensable image contrast for monitoring treatment and investigating pathology and function. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, preventing patients with advanced chronic kidney disease from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams, as well as potential gadolinium deposition in the body and brain for patients with normal kidney function. This project aims to address these problems by developing and validating low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using deep learning. !",Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning,9776655,R44EB027560,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Infrastructure', 'Kidney Failure', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis\xa0', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Relaxation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Validation', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'learning strategy', 'prevent', 'software development', 'tumor']",NIBIB,"SUBTLE MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2019,185379,0.02369852347003385
"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET in PET/MR and target delineation in radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from MR-only data.

"Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy Project Summary/Abstract Diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) currently relies on a qualitative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and lacks standardization. This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9746373,R21EB026665,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Central cord canal structure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiculopathy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'theories', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment optimization', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,234000,0.02117424751134527
"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current clinical image modalities can be utilized to develop patient-specific computational models to pre-operatively plan transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures.

"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9766063,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,676760,0.03669852542048854
"Content-based MR-TRUS Fusion without Tracking There are about 3 million American men living with prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States. If the prostate cancer is caught early before it spreads to other parts of the body, by active monitoring or treatment, most men will not die from it. Nevertheless, 22% to 47% of the patients with negative biopsies but elevated prostate-specific antigen levels may still harbor malignant tumors, which can be life threatening and could have been missed by the commonly used ultrasound guided random biopsy. By contrast, fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted biopsies has shown to significantly improve the cancer detection rate. However, MR-TRUS fusion itself is very challenging due to the difficulties in directly registering images of these two very different modalities in different dimensions. To bypass the difficult registration problems, the existing fusion techniques require the use of specialized expensive and cumbersome hardware tracking devices, which increases cost and elongates procedures. More importantly, due to a number of factors such as patient movement, respiratory motion and ultrasound transducer pressure change, prostate motion can happen during a procedure and cause the images to be misaligned. Timely noticing and correcting such motion require great skill and knowledge of radiological imaging, where studies show a steep learning curve for mastering fusion systems. Failing in image registration and motion compensation renders the fusion guided biopsy performing no differently than random biopsy. To address the fundamental cause of the problems, the goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR- TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices. The proposed research is foundational for developing next generation of MR-TRUS fusion guidance systems for prostate biopsy to achieve robust performance with lower costs. Recent advancement in machine learning, especially deep learning, has provided us new tools and new angles to tackle this challenging problem. This project aims for directly fusing 2D TRUS frames with 3D MR volume by developing novel deep learning methods for image reconstruction and registration. The proposed methods are designed to exploit both population and patient specific imaging information to accurately align images. As all learning-based image registration methods try to better use population knowledge to improve the registration performance, few of them have been able to efficiently use patient specific information, which can be essential to obtain robust and accurate performance. Upon successful completion, the innovation created from the project will disrupt the common perception that hardware tracking has to be used for multimodal image fusion-guided interventions and alleviate the demand on physicians’ experience and skill in image analysis and fusion to help obtain consistent results. This project will lead to the development of novel prostate biopsy systems and will also impact a range of other image fusion based interventional guidance technologies. Fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted prostate biopsies can significantly improve the detection of aggressive cancer. The goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR-TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices.

"IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging Project Summary This proposal requests funds to provide travel support for graduates to attend and participate in the IEEE Inter- national Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2019 conference, Venice, Italy on April 08-11, 2019. The main objective of the IEEE ISBI is to bring together researchers with interests in mathematical and computa- tional aspects of biomedical imaging, with a focus on addressing problems of significance to the development and application of imaging systems across spatial scales, from microscopy to whole-body imaging. ISBI partici- pants – on the order of 600-700 from across the world are involved in biomedical imaging research and development in academic institutions, government laboratories, or R&D departments of private companies. ISBI is co-sponsored by two IEEE societies: Signal Processing Society (SPS) and Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS), representing academia, industry, and healthcare, and considered the world's foremost societies in biomedical engineering and imaging. SPS and EMBS publish IEEE Transactions on Medical Imag- ing, Transactions on Image Processing, Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, Transactions on Computational Imaging, and IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, among others. Since incep- tion in 2002, ISBI has become the leading international conference bringing together researchers from diverse algorithmic fields, applications, modalities, and size scales, to facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas across imag- ing modalities and scales. Conference topics include physical, biological and statistical modeling, image formation and reconstruction, computational and statistical image analysis, visualization and image quality as- sessment, and artificial intelligence and machine learning for big image data. ISBI, like other IEEE SPS and EMBS conferences, requires submission and review of a 4-page paper. Peer reviews are handled by a 50-mem- ber editorial board (area editors) of leading experts in the community, who in turn assign papers to well- qualified reviewers. All oral and poster papers are published in IEEExplore as Proceedings of ISBI. If awarded, IEEE anticipates the primary impact of this R13 grant will be increased attendance of U.S.-based students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty. By offering to cover a significant portion of attendee's travel expenses, the cost-benefit ratio for attending ISBI 2019 will be extremely favorable. Furthermore, IEEE will award travel grants based on need and scientific excellence, creating opportunities for those early career researchers who have accepted papers (of which less than 50% are accepted to ISBI) and who have limited means to travel. IEEE will be particularly supportive in providing travel awards to women, under-represented groups, and persons with disabilities. Benefits can largely be summarized as “exposure” and education. ISBI provides opportunity for student exposure to many more areas of computational imaging research than generally available in her/his home institution, and concurrently provides opportunity for students to interact with leaders in the field through tutorials, plenary, oral, and poster presentations, and individual discussions.

"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.!",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,9669002,R61AR073552,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2019,447173,0.033304320246295406
"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",9798875,R01EB028591,"['Affect', 'Alkalies', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Uric Acid', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcium phosphate', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'prevent', 'risk minimization', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,357486,0.01883942481457002
"Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials Project Summary / Abstract In patients with lymphomas and other cancers, quantitative evaluation of the extent of tumor burden is im- portant for staging, restaging, and assessment of therapeutic response or relapse; yet measurement of overall tumor burden is challenging with current tools, particularly when lymph nodes are confluent or difficult to fully differentiate from surrounding structures. Precision medicine and novel therapeutics are emphasizing the need to introduce a risk-adapted approach to tailor appropriate treatment strategies for cancer patients. The ability to quantitatively assess cancer phenotypes with functional and anatomical imaging that could efficiently and ac- curately map patients to gene expression profiling, clinical information, matching cohorts, and novel treatment regimens could potentially result in more optimal management of patients with cancer.  This Academic-Industry Partnership aims to translate recently developed technologies for semi- automated image segmentation and quantification of lymph nodes into robust tools and integrate them into an existing cloud-based system for management of multicenter oncology clinical trials. The ability to semi- automatically segment lymph node pathology with computed tomography (CT), as well as quantify nodal me- tabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) will enable comprehensive tracking of morphological and functional changes related to disease progression and treatment response.  Since 2004, the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center's (DF/HCC) Tumor Imaging Metrics Core (TIMC) has developed the Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC (PIM) platform to manage clinical trial image assessment workflows. Currently, there are nearly 50,000 consistently measured lymph node measurements in the TIMC database. The PIM system is used to make over 20,000 time point imaging assessments per year at eight NCI- designated Cancer Centers and aims to grow quickly by transitioning to a fully cloud-hosted system.  Given sufficient training data, state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technolo- gies can meet or even exceed human performance on specific imaging analysis tasks. Recent studies have indicated that AI-based lymph node segmentation from CT scans is nearing human performance levels, and we will extend and translate this work into a commercial tool. Specifically, our aim is to translate recent ad- vancements in AI-based segmentation into deployable services, and integrate these services into the clinical trial workflow. The proposed system will be designed to incorporate expert feedback provided by image ana- lysts and radiologists back into the ground truth dataset, allowing for continuous improvement in accuracy and clinical acceptance. We will extend our semi-automatic CT segmentation technologies to quantify lymph node metabolism in PET/CT, using lymphoma as the model disease. Integration of these technologies with PIM will provide an ongoing source of consistently measured quantitative data across a network of cancer centers. Project Narrative Advanced quantitative imaging is underutilized in oncologic clinical practice and research because the time investment entailed in manual lesion segmentation remains prohibitive. This partnership proposes to integrate machine learning based quantitative imaging tools into the existing Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC clinical trial image management system. We will use data from the centralized Tumor Imaging Metrics Core at the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center to produce ground truth training data and develop semi-automated multimodali- ty lesion analysis for patients with cancer.",Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials,9817851,R01CA235589,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Goals', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'NCI-Designated Cancer Center', 'Nodal', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Services', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Burden', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'glucose metabolism', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'lymph nodes', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'success', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,683973,-0.03556445386695065
"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource. Project Narrative The Neuroimaging Analysis Center is a research and technology center with the mission of advancing the role of neuroimaging in health care. The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the possibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment.

"Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT In the U.S., more than 600,000 knee osteoarthritis (OA)-related total knee joint replacement (TKR) cases are reported every year, exceeding $17 billion estimated direct costs annually. There is a growing need for disease- modifying therapies that prevent or delay the need for TKR. However, development of such therapies remains challenging due to the lack of objective and measurable OA biomarkers for disease progression. The course of the OA is highly variable between individuals and the OA progresses too slowly, making it difficult to identify sensitive OA biomarkers capable of capturing minor changes on the knee joint. This has slowed development of effective therapies and prevents physicians from providing the most effective advice about minimizing the need for TKR. In this project, our goal is to develop imaging biomarkers to monitor minor OA-related changes in knee joint health that lead to TKR. To achieve this goal, we will combine novel deep learning algorithms with clinical and imaging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The OAI dataset includes clinical data, biospecimens, radiographs, and magnetic resonance (MR) images collected over 8 years. The proposed project has three Specific Aims: (i) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from the bilateral posteroanterior fixed-flexion knee radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); (ii) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from structural and compositional MR images using 3D CNNs with RNNs combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); and (iii) to determine whether deep learning–based imaging biomarkers can act as surrogates to predict the OA progression using a subject cohort (n = 296) independent of the cohort used to identify imaging biomarkers. The proposed project will couple deep learning with diagnostic radiology to unveil key combinations of OA-relevant features directly from images with minimal user interaction. This will facilitate fast individualized assessment of OA progression using whole knee joint images directly. If successful, this study will bring new insights into the development of imaging biomarkers for OA progression and more broadly into our understanding and treatment of OA. The knowledge gained in this project will help to advance close monitoring of OA progression by opening new perspectives on the regions and parameters for potential inclusion in both intervention studies and clinical practice. NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disorder of joints and is the most common reason leading to total knee joint replacement. Our proposed study aims to develop a novel automated OA-relevant imaging biomarker identification system based on radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and deep learning methods to study knee OA progression. We will address whether combining deep learning algorithms with medical images will determine the key combinations of features relevant to knee OA that are required to accurately predict the OA progression outcome.",Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis,9818000,R01AR074453,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'tool']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,489349,0.019590816537610408
"Automatic Thoracic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers in Thoracic Region ABSTRACT As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention. Cancers in the thoracic region, which include lung, esophageal, thymus, mesothelioma and breast cancers, are among the most pervasive and deadly cancers. The protection of normal thoracic organs including lungs, heart, esophagus and spinal cord is critical in reducing long term toxicity in such cancers. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to such organs-at-risk (OARs), they are required to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans during radiation treatment planning to get an accurate dosage distribution. Despite tremendous effort into the development of semi- or fully-automatic segmentation solutions, current automated segmentation software, mostly using the atlas-based methods, has not yet reached the level of accuracy and robustness required for clinical usage. Therefore, in current practice, significant manual efforts are still required in the OAR segmentation process. Manual contouring suffers from inter- and intra-observer variability as well as institutional variability where different sites adopt distinct contouring atlases and labeling criteria and thus leads to inaccuracy and variability in OAR segmentation. When OARs are very close to the treatment target, segmentation errors as small as a few millimeters can have a statistically significant impact on dosimetry distribution and outcome. In addition, it is also costly and time consuming as it can take 1-2 hours of a clinicians’ time to segment major thoracic organs due to the large number of axial slices required. The associated human efforts would significantly increase if adaptive radiation therapy (ART) is used as OARs from two or more simulation CT scans need to be segmented to adjust treatment plans. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning methods has revolutionized many computer-vision areas and the adoption of deep learning in medical applications has shown great success. Based on a deep-learning-based algorithm we developed that achieved better-than-human performance and ranked 1st in 2017 American Association of Physicist in Medicine Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge, a thoracic OAR auto-segmentation product will be developed in this project with the two aims: 1) improve and validate the deep-learning-based automatic thoracic organ segmentation algorithm on a larger clinical data set, and 2) incorporate this algorithm into a preliminary product that fits into the clinical workflow. With this product, the segmentation accuracy can be improved, leading to more robust treatment plans in protecting normal organs and improved long term patient outcome. Furthermore, the time and cost of radiation treatment planning can be greatly reduced, contributing to a more affordable cancer treatment and reduced healthcare burden.

"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9788239,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,562232,-0.013932404141745075
"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,9825278,R21EB027241,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tissue biomarkers', 'white matter']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2019,209851,0.010786270583011006
"Ultraportable Stroke CT Based on Stationary Carbon Nanotube X-ray Source and Deep Learning Image Formation PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this 12-month SBIR phase 1 project is developing an imaging device that will enable highly efficient and cost-effective stroke imaging for patients suffered trauma events. The expected technical outcome will be a proof-of-concept head CT imaging system with sub- second imaging speed, sub-mSv radiation dose, and high-quality images. Imaging systems with such capabilities will address the current deficiency in timely diagnosis of stroke patients, and benefit society with higher efficiency and lower cost. Such imaging device will make a strong economic impact on the global head CT imaging market, which is estimated to be about $36 billion in the U.S. In a longer term, the novel imaging technology could be translated into markets for security screening, industry inspection, and dental imaging. This project is based on the recent research results by Dr. Cao's team under the support of an NSF CAREER award (PI Dr. Cao, 08/01/2014-07/31/2019, $400,000) and a Dr. Cao's Commonwealth Research Commercialization Fund (CRCF) award (Title: “Computed Tomography Without Moving Parts for Fast and Portable Biomedical Imaging”, 07/01/2017- 06/30/2019, $100,000). The project has a strong footing in intellectual property. The technology is protected by a few patent applications at the Virginia Tech, including US. 62/316649, “Ultrafast Micro-CT for Imaging Free-Moving Animals” (Inventor: Guohua Cao), and PCT/US2013/061049 and US14/429835, “System and Method of Stationary Source Computed Tomography” (Inventor: Guohua Cao, et. al.). In this project, the team will design and build a proof-of-concept head CT platform to test the feasibility of ultraportable and compact head CT based on the stationary carbon nanotube x-ray source design and deep learning image reconstruction algorithm. The expected outcomes from this project include demonstration of the feasibility for ultrafast, low dose, and diagnostic imaging capabilities for intracerebral hemorrhage in head phantoms (ICH), with potential automatic ICH identification through deep learning algorithm. A ready-to- prototype head CT device will be optimized and designed, and a corresponding business plan will be developed. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a common of death in the world at tremendous social and healthcare costs. Currently head CT is typically used for initial evaluation of stroke patients for signs of intracerebral hemorrhage. An ultraportable stroke CT that can be mounted in a small minivan would significantly shorten the time it takes for the diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage, particularly from trauma incidents.

"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives.

"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease. The imaging informatics platform described in this application will enable biomedical researchers to capture, analyze, and share imaging and related data.

"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9762101,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,223680,0.035148176148229966
"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them. Overall Project Narrative  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) develops novel imaging techniques and technologies for the improved diagnosis and management of cancer, musculoskeletal disease, neurological disease and other disorders with a profound impact on human health.

"Computer Vision-Based Navigation System for High-Precision Orthopedic Trauma Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Closed or open fracture reduction and internal fixation is the standard surgical approach in treating pelvic fractures, with current clinical practice using fluoroscopic guidance, guidewire insertion, and cannulated screw placement. The challenge in reckoning complex 3D morphology in 2D fluoroscopy presents a major source of uncertainty, trial-and- error, and poor outcomes, with 20-30% rate of suboptimal screw placement and long fluoroscopic runtime (mean fluoro time > 123 s) exposing operating personnel to high levels of radiation exposure. Despite these challenges, mainstream surgical approach has remained largely unchanged for 35 years, and surgical navigation systems (though increasingly common in neurosurgery) present cost and workflow barriers that limit their broad applicability in trauma surgery. We propose a computer vision-based navigation approach that is compatible with routine trauma surgery workflow, offers real-time guidance with accuracy comparable to stereotactic navigation, gives ten-fold reduction in radiation exposure, and works with tools already common in the trauma surgery arsenal. The proposed system uses a miniature stereoscopic camera mounted onboard the surgical drill in combination with 3D-2D registration of fluoroscopic views for direct, real-time registration of the instrument trajectory relative to patient anatomy. Real-time overlay of instrument trajectory in fluoroscopic views and/or CT permits accurate identification of guidewire entry point, orientation, and conformance within bone corridors and will reduce reliance on “fluoro hunting” and trial-and-error guidewire placement. The following aims develop and evaluate the system for application in pelvic trauma surgery, including quantitative assessment of accuracy, workflow, and radiation dose in pre-clinical studies. Aim 1. System for computer vision-based guidance in trauma surgery. The hardware and software components required for vision-based tracking onboard a standard surgical drill will be developed, providing real-time trajectory overlay in fluoroscopy and/or preoperative CT. A fast calibration method will be developed for automatic drill axis calibration. Automatic feature-based registration of the video and fluoroscopic frames enables real-time overlay of instrument trajectory in fluoroscopic views (Fluoro Navigation), and 3D-2D registration between CT and fluoroscopy will enable real-time overlay of the instrument trajectory in CT (CT Navigation). Aim 2: Evaluation in preclinical studies. The vision-based navigation system will be implemented in pre-clinical (cadaver) experiments to evaluate accuracy and workflow. These studies will evaluate the geometric accuracy and workflow factors relating to the number of repeated insertion attempts, procedure time, and radiation dose, evaluating vision-based Fluoro Navigation and CT Navigation in comparison to conventional freehand fluoroscopy guidance. Successful completion of the aims will establish a system suitable for computer vision-based navigation to be translated to clinical studies in future work. Such a system offers a potentially major advance in routine trauma surgery, bringing capabilities comparable to state-of-the-art stereotactic navigation without the cost, complexity, and additional workflow of conventional navigation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even experienced trauma surgeons are challenged in resolving the complex 3D morphology of the pelvis in 2D x-ray fluoroscopy, presenting a major source of uncertainty, a high rate of malpositioned screws, and high levels of radiation exposure to the patient and operating staff. To facilitate high-precision pelvic trauma surgery and reduce intraoperative radiation dose, we propose a computer vision-based navigation approach providing real-time overlay of surgical instrument trajectories in fluoroscopic views and CT, facilitating accurate identification of guidewire entry point, orientation, and conformance within safe bone corridors. The approach offers a major advance compared to conventional navigation by not requiring intraoperative 3D imaging, avoiding time-consuming calibration, and eliminating externally-positioned hardware in the operating room, and the proposed research translates the system from basic development and quantitative testing to preclinical studies evaluating geometric accuracy, workflow, and radiation dose.",Computer Vision-Based Navigation System for High-Precision Orthopedic Trauma Surgery,9806153,R21EB028330,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Calibration', 'Clinical Research', 'Closed Fractures', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Mainstreaming', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Navigation System', 'Needles', 'Open Fractures', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Instruments', 'System', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Uncertainty', 'Visceral', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mortality', 'neurosurgery', 'neurovascular', 'pelvis fracture', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'sample fixation', 'socioeconomics', 'stereoscopic', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,238182,0.018048485323555213
"An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System In this SBIR Phase IIb proposal Xoran intends to commercialize a compact and affordable, yet highly- functional, system to provide real time image updates and navigation guidance in support of minimally invasive cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures. The effort builds on previously developed compact and portable flat-panel Computed Tomography (CT) technology which has been commercialized for hard tissue applications, and incorporates work done in earlier phases of this project to generate viable high- quality images of the soft tissue structures in the brain. Intraoperatively obtained images tightly integrated into an onboard surgical navigation will provide updated instrument localization using next generation electromagnetic tool tip guidance. Workflow optimizations become possible when the imaging and guidance are one device, including fast local image updates, automatic image-to-world registration, as well as speed and simplicity of use. The project includes expansion of the system capabilities to facilitate precise minimally-invasive surgical removal of tumors in both the head and spine. It incorporates a machine-learning based deep neural network method for image finalization to allow high quality, low radiation image updates. The three-year project involves meeting technical milestones of system development including imaging capability, registration, navigation accuracy, speed, workflow, radiation dose considerations and cost. Clinical evaluations will take place at University of Michigan, and a team of consulting physicians has been assembled for oversight, input and feedback. Narrative / Relevance to Public Health Minimally invasive surgical procedures have many benefits to public health including reducing the medical risks and costs associated with brain cancer and spine surgery. However such procedures are often time consuming and technically difficult as the surgeon is unable to directly visualize the area of the operation. In this project, an intraoperative surgical system is developed with onboard imaging capability in order to enable minimally invasive surgeries to be performed more safely and completely, by providing hi-resolution imaging of the brain and spine while the surgeon operates.",An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System,9764897,R44CA112966,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Capital', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Consult', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Michigan', 'Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures', 'Monitor', 'Navigation System', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Neurosurgical Procedures', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pituitary Neoplasms', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spine surgery', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vertebral column', 'Veterinary Medicine', 'Veterinary Schools', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer site', 'cancer surgery', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cranium', 'deep neural network', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'meetings', 'minimally invasive', 'neurosurgery', 'next generation', 'operation', 'point of care', 'portability', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'soft tissue', 'spine bone structure', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,"XORAN TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2019,1350820,0.016092339326057407
"Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia PROJECT SUMMARY  Abnormalities of white matter are important in schizophrenia. A preponderance of studies have found decreased levels of transcripts for myelin-related proteins in autopsy brains. Some have found decrease in the proteins themselves, and some have not. Hundreds of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have found reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the brains of many people with schizophrenia (SCH). Decreased FA is interpreted as disruption of normal architecture. However, postmortem examination has failed to identify characteristic abnormalities. This suggests that abnormalities are subtle, and perhaps postmortem examinations have not used the right tools to find them. We have therefore been developing, as part of a collaboration supported by our concluding Fogarty project, two new methods to characterize white matter at high resolution. The first is a machine learning protocol to measure axonal diameters and myelin sheath thickness in electron microscope (EM) images of prefrontal white matter, recognizing and avoiding artifacts in EM of autopsy tissue. This will enable us to measure thousands of fibers in EM images produced as part of our concluding Fogarty project, from individuals with SCH, major depressive disorder (MDD), or no psychiatric illness (NPI). The second method, suggested by the DTI findings, is to analyze the arrangement of the axons themselves. We will use 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of high-resolution images of the axons themselves, identified by Bielschowsky silver stain or immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated neurofilament protein. To obtain high-resolution images of Bielschowsy stains, we will take advantage of the recent observation by Dr. Mark Sonders, co-investigator on this project, that these and other heavy metal stains luminesce under 2-photon infrared excitation. This yields clear and measurable images of individual axons. We will perform these procedures on sections from existing paraffin blocks that comprise a complete left prefrontal coronal section from 36 triads containing 1 case each of SCH, MDD, or NPI, matched for sex and age. These brains were included in earlier studies that yielded data on protein composition, mRNA for myelin-related proteins, DNA methylation, microglial activation, and semiquantitative myelin histology. In a third, exploratory aim, we will employ graphical models to combine these various types of data with known properties of CNS white matter and myelin to build a model of what is disturbed in schizophrenia. We expect that novel techniques for data fusion will reveal associations based on multidimensional correlations that could not be detected by modeling the single-domain datasets separately. In the process of completing these scientific aims, we will pursue the pedagogic goals of training the first two professional biostatisticians in Macedonia, and an academic pathologist. We will also hold a seminar course for biological researchers to build awareness and understanding of the power of biostatistical and other computational methods to enrich their research. NARRATIVE Our ongoing Fogarty/NIMH research project in Macedonia (R01 MH060877, “Building Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia”), has demonstrated biochemical abnormalities of white matter in schizophrenia that are not present in major depressive disorder. However, we have not seen anatomical abnormalities of white matter, which MRI studies of schizophrenia tell us should exist, and as the biochemistry also suggests. To explore white matter in novel ways, we are developing new methods of microscopy, image analysis and statistical inference, which we now propose to employ on a large scale.",Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia,9953486,R56MH117769,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academy', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Awareness', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electrons', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Macedonia', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myelin', 'Myelin Sheath', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurofilament Proteins', 'Paraffin', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Silver Staining', 'Stains', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'deep neural network', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'high resolution imaging', 'histological image', 'histological studies', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy', 'two-photon', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R56,2019,10000,-0.02298338825667984
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9782996,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,348107,-0.005516478173761378
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,9775212,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,628430,-0.0015947503025370898
"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype. Project Narrative Our group has established the only three-dimensional form of histology that is suitable for histopathology and quantitative tissue phenotyping, tissue X-ray microtomography (micro-CT). We outline here a plan to establish mechanisms for increasing resolution and field-of-view, to add sample multiplexing, to simply sample preparation, and to explore machine learning mechanisms for defining normal and abnormal structure towards whole-organism complete tissue phenotyping. The resulting tools will allow the community to comprehensively and computationally determine the roles of genes and environment in defining phenotype, which has implications in drug development, biomedical research, and medicine.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),9792960,R24OD018559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Genetics', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cesium', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Iodides', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve', 'Normal Range', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Preparation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spiral Computed Tomography', 'Stains', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'clinical toxicology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data sharing', 'detector', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'feature detection', 'histological studies', 'human disease', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'millimeter', 'mutant', 'programs', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2019,667280,0.004080951677559646
"A TOF, DOI, MRI compatible PET detector to support sub-millimeter neuroPET imaging Abstract The overall goal of this research is to develop next generation positron emission tomography (PET) detector technology to support non-invasive, quantitative brain imaging at spatial and temporal resolutions currently not achievable with human neuro-PET systems. The developed PET detector technology will also be compatible with operation in an MRI system. The proposed research is targeted to the NIH Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative. Human brain imaging with PET/MRI will be an essential tool in neuroscience studies to ""Develop innovative technologies to understand the human brain and treat its disorders; create and support integrated brain research networks."" The key advancement that we introduce is a PET detector with <100 psec time-of-flight (TOF) PET coincidence resolution, <2 mm continuous depth of interaction (DOI) positioning and intrinsic detector spatial resolution to support <1 mm PET image resolution throughout the system imaging field of view (FOV). Detector modules have been designed that individually achieve these performance metrics; however, no detector module has been designed that supports all of them. To make disruptive advancements in neuro-imaging using PET, one must push the image spatial resolution (i.e., currently 2-3 mm image resolution) as well as coincidence timing resolution and also be MRI compatible. The impact of this project is that we will advance the state of the art in all of these critical performance areas. We will achieve these goals by first understanding the role that different PET detector performance parameters have on task-based figures of merit for neuroPET imaging. We will investigate how both TOF and image resolution impact figure of merit performance for estimation, detection and characterization imaging tasks. Monte Carlo simulation will be used along with both object-based (i.e., mathematical) and anthropomorphic digital phantoms. Next we will optimize SiPM device selection, electronics and detector geometry for <100 psec TOF coincidence timing, 1 mm intrinsic spatial resolution and <2 mm DOI positioning resolution. We will build and characterize a prototype PET detector module utilizing a novel dual- sided slat crystal detector design. To advance coincidence timing performance we will investigate the use of machine learning to estimate the arrival time of detected events. Finally, we will optimize the detector design for MRI compatibility. We will fully test and characterize performance of our prototype detector on the benchtop and in a MRI scanner while running clinical MRI pulse sequences. At the end of this developmental project we will be in position to build a state of the art, MRI compatible, TOF, DOI PET imaging system. Narrative The overall goal of this work is to develop detector imaging technology that will enable new research into the development, function and aging of the human brain. This technology will allow functional imaging of the brain at higher spatial resolution and higher coincidence timing resolution than previously achieved and also facilitate simultaneous multi-modality imaging (i.e., PET/MRI) at these new levels of performance.","A TOF, DOI, MRI compatible PET detector to support sub-millimeter neuroPET imaging",9791188,R01EB026964,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Side', 'Silicon', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging detector', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'operation', 'prototype', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,22992,0.005191868789122557
"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,9802309,R01EB028337,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Crystallization', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Gamma Rays', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portugal', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain size', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response', 'retinal rods']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2019,293568,0.0005951995339051864
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. It will pve the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process.",MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning,9624738,R01CA193730,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'anatomic imaging', 'attenuation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'density', 'electron density', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'primary endpoint', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,343572,0.034273605228212566
"I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia. 1. Executive Summary Nearly 150,000 patients in the US undergo lower extremity amputations annually secondary to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) complicated by critical limb ischemia (CLI).1,2,3 To increase a patient’s post-operative quality of life, surgeons attempt to salvage as much limb tissue as possible while also considering the likelihood of primary wound healing at a given level of amputation (LOA).4 The principal challenge in this decision is that surgeons overestimate the likelihood of healing at the selected LOA. Therefore, in the first year, 10% to 35% of amputations eventually require re-amputation to a more proximal level.5-7 This additional treatment prolongs the patient’s return to walking, worsening their condition and deteriorating their mental health. The burden to the healthcare system is immense. The average cost for each amputation is over $70,000, as evidenced by a recent publication that shows diabetic foot ulcer complications, mainly attributed to amputation, cost more than the five most costly forms of cancer.8 Despite these facts, there are no objective studies for selection of LOA in patients with PAD. To address this critical problem, Spectral MD (SMD) has developed a point-of-care imaging device (DeepView), which simultaneously performs multispectral imaging (MSI) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) imaging across the visible and infrared spectrum to obtain a quantitative microvascular tissue assessment. These optical measurements are integrated using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to provide a quantitative aid to the physician’s determination of tissue viability at a proposed amputation site. If used for routine assessment prior to amputation, SMD expects DeepView to reduce the rate of re- amputation by 70%, resulting in up to 38,000 fewer re-amputations per year while improving quality of life for amputees and reducing associated health costs. The central objective for SMD’s Phase I SBIR is to perform a feasibility clinical study to demonstrate the DeepView device will achieve greater than 90% accuracy in identifying the healing potential of tissue at the amputation site. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: Aim 1: Complete a Feasibility Study creating a database of pre-amputation images. This data will be used for construction of the AI algorithm to predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 2: Identify MSI and PPG features that can accurately predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 3: Using Aim I clinical data, finalize the AI algorithm architecture and estimate sample size needed for a Phase II Pivotal Study in which the necessary training data to achieve at least 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity will be obtained. As of this Supplement request, SMD has initiated a clinical study for feasibility and enrolled the first subject. Through collaboration with the clinical study site Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Dennis Gable, SMD developed the protocol and trained his research staff at the study site, Baylor Medical Center Plano, in the use of the DeepView device. SMD anticipates enrollment of five subjects each month over the next 6 months. The I-Corps team will consist of the following members: Michael DiMaio, MD – Role: C-Level Corporate Officer. Dr. DiMaio, MD is Founder and Chief Executive Officer of SMD and has led SMD in obtaining over $30M in non-dilutive government funding and private investments. His distinguished career includes extensive experience as an entrepreneur, clinician, and scientist. With over 20 years’ experience as a cardiovascular surgeon, Dr. DiMaio has a widespread network of physicians and hospitals from which to draw contacts for customer interviews. Jeffrey Thatcher, PhD – Role: PI. Dr. Thatcher is the Chief Scientist at SMD and is a leader in the development of diagnostic imaging for soft tissue diseases. He led SMD in conceptualizing and inventing SMD’s core imaging technology undergoing clinical trials in three wound diagnostics applications including: burns; diabetic ulcers; and amputation. Wensheng Fan, MS – Role: Industry Expert. Wensheng Fan is Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at SMD. He is an executive, entrepreneur, and innovator with over 20 years of experience in natural speech recognition and real time imaging systems. At SMD, he leads market engagement, strategic financial planning, and device development. Narrative In patients with peripheral arterial disease, reported rates of re-amputation due to non-healing of a primary amputation are very significant—approximately 20% of below-the-knee amputations require eventual revision, with even higher rates established for amputations at the level of the foot. There are no gold-standard tests for selection of level of amputation (LOA) to aid clinical judgment. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is developing the DeepView-Gen2 imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging and a machine learning algorithm to quantitatively measure microvascular blood flow and tissue healing potential to assist in the clinical selection of LOA and minimize the incidence of re-amputation and its associated morbidity and mortality.",I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia.,9827388,R43HL142428,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Burn injury', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diabetic ulcer', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Innovation Corps', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Ischemia', 'Judgment', 'Knee', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Principal Investigator', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'S Phase', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Soft Tissue Disorder', 'Specificity', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Wound Healing', 'career', 'cost', 'experience', 'foot', 'healing', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'point of care', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'speech recognition', 'wound']",NHLBI,"SPECTRAL MD, INC.",R43,2019,54976,0.012702194333520737
"Augmented reality visualization for intraoperative guidance based on fluorescence lifetime Project summary/Abstract Optical imaging techniques have demonstrated potential to delineate tumor margins in vivo during surgery as they can rapidly characterize structural, biochemical or functional properties of tissue. Implementation in clinical practice demands rapid visualization and augmentation of imaging data but is often limited by the difficulty in dynamic registration, slow image reconstruction, lack of real- time ability or the need for contrast agents. The goal of this proposal is to implement the recently released Microsoft HoloLens with fiber-based imaging techniques to dynamically augment tissue characteristics directly on the interrogated area in the surgeon’s field of view. The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: (1) To realize a prototype of the augmented reality visualization platform and to combine it with our fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) system, implement a user interface for a convenient interaction with the device. (2) To evaluate and optimize the scanning resolution and the registration precision using fluorescence phantoms and demonstrate the system in vivo for ten patients undergoing lumpectomy surgery. A current pilot study has demonstrated the potential of FLIm to localize tumor margins on excised breast specimen. The acquired in vivo data will help to systematically analyze differences between ex vivo and in vivo fluorescence decay signatures and provide initial data for a large-scale study that will be necessary to delineate tumor margins in vivo. The innovation of this proposal is that it will realize an augmented reality visualization platform for FLIm and other fiber based optical imaging modalities providing dynamic (continuous) augmentation of tissue properties directly on the interrogated area (surgeon’s field of view) in real-time without requiring the injection of contrast agents.

"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9750736,R01EB021396,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'clinical translation', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data pipeline', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2019,434944,0.020335446719212155
"Automatic SUV Extraction and Biodistribution Analysis of Preclinical PET Preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) plays a significant role in monitoring radiotracer biodistributions for the development of new therapies. The standardized uptake value (SUV) has become one of the most important quantitation measures in PET analysis. However, SUV extraction from PET data hinges on the ability to clearly delineate the organ region-of-interest (ROI) from an anatomical reference. Cross-comparison of different organ SUVs and biodistributions is also cumbersome due to complex registration strategies of each animal with an unknown pose and size. Operator bias and lack of efficient co-registration strategies results in poor data reproducibility, high data variability, low data throughput and prohibits the use of fully-automated data parsing and data analysis for predicting early therapy outcomes with high sensitivity. In Vivo Analytics will directly address these shortcomings by developing InVivoPET. It will be a cloud-based PET data analysis tool, which will enable automatic organ SUV extraction followed by an instantaneous biodistribution analysis. InVivoPET will automatically coregister PET images to the animal’s anatomy and will calculate biodistributions in almost real-time. InVivoPET consists of several parts. First, a Body Conforming Animal Mold (BCAM) enables consistent spatial and longitudinal registration of the animal’s pose and location to the PET data. Second, a statistical mouse atlas based on an Organ Probability Map (OPM) provides a digital and operator-independent organ ROI template. Third, a cloud-based software with a browser-based user interface enables an automatic organ SUV extraction with following biodistribution analysis. Last, machine learning and data mining algorithms can be applied in the future that will further enhance study outcomes. InVivoPET does not rely on manual delineation of organs. A machine-driven data analysis fully eliminates operator-dependent variability and increases data reproducibility. It will enable the drug development team to quantitate the impact of candidate therapeutics with the highest accuracy, reduces the time to enter clinical trials, reduces costs, and ensures the quantification and consistency of PET data. Therefore, the hypothesis is that the organ SUV can automatically be extracted from PET data using the BCAM and OPM. In Aim 1, we will modify the BCAM for housing mice with surface-protruding tumors and confirm the ability for spatially aligning mice with tumor xenografts to the OPM. In Aim 2, we will perform PET imaging of tumor bearing mice using 18F-FDG and confirm the ability for automatically extracting the organ SUV based on the OPM. The successful completion of the proposed project will help to commercialize InVivoPET, which will be sold as a plug-in to existing PET systems and as a PET- manufacturer independent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Project Narrative: InVivo Analytics seeks funding for demonstrating the feasibility of automatically analyzing radiotracer biodistributions of small animal positron emission tomography (PET). Biodistribution analysis is currently operator-dependent, time-consuming, and prone to error while reducing the reproducibility of study results. The proposed technology will be fully automated, operator- independent, and will facilitate the development of new therapies in small animal models of infection, inflammation, and cancer.",Automatic SUV Extraction and Biodistribution Analysis of Preclinical PET,9680585,R43CA224841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Automation', 'Biodistribution', 'Biotechnology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Early treatment', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molds', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Outcome Study', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radioisotopes', 'Reproducibility', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Shoulder', 'Skeleton', 'Standardization', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'animal imaging', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'data mining', 'digital', 'dosimetry', 'drug development', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'novel therapeutics', 'platform-independent', 'pre-clinical', 'radiotracer', 'sex', 'software as a service', 'subcutaneous', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapy development', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft', 'uptake']",NCI,"IN VIVO ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2019,222931,0.0029373215730522013
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9735326,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,396887,0.016270404768033847
"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution.

"New instrument and methods for fast, diagnostic-quality histology of un-embedded bone marrow and lymph node specimens Project Summary Over 600,000 bone marrow biopsies are performed every year in the United States, while hundreds of thousands more lymph node biospies are performed. Histological evaluation of these biopsies is a critical component of care for hematologic diseases including leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disease and non-neoplastic conditions such as viral infections and autoimmune conditions.  We have developed a platform that we consider a paradigm shift in the histologic examination of tissues. It is based on a new chemical process, imaging, and image processing approach that we have dubbed Clearing Histology with MultiPhoton microscopy (CHiMP).The CHiMP technology enables visual analysis of entire intact, un-embedded and uncut specimens within a short time-frame and with a resolution that is amenable to primary diagnosis. The significant clinical benefits include: 1) potential for same-day diagnosis, 2) labor and cost savings, 3) access to 3D perspective, 4) increased visual data from same specimen, 5) complete tissue preservation for ancillary studies such as DNA analysis and 6) inherent benefits of digital data such as reduced risk of loss, ready remote review by experts, and amenability to machine learning tools. Hematopoietic tissue evaluation would similarly benefit from these advantages, but unfortunately the systems developed thus far lack the resolution typically needed for visual examination of hematopoietic tissues.  For this Phase I SBIR proposal, an objective is to develop customized optics to improve the resolution of our current microscopes and thereby enable use in the specialized field of hematology. Commercially available objective lenses that are compatible with our immersion medium are either limited to numerical apertures (NA) that are less than one, affecting resolution and image quality, or have insufficient working distances for imaging past the coverslip and surface roughness to obtain complete sections. We will design and test a custom objective lens with high NA and long working distance, suited for our proprietary reagents. Integrating such a lens into our microscope will also require the design of a custom scan lens, custom beam conditioning optics, and a custom polygon scanner.  An associated goal is to develop a novel approach to preparing bone marrow aspiration specimens that will make them amenable to imaging with CHiMP, potentially reducing the need for core biopsies by permitting unambiguous morphologic categorization of cell subtypes in their architectural context, without the routine need for immunohistochemistry, and while preserving nucleic acids for molecular/genetic evaluation. Project Narrative Applikate Technologies has developed a powerful platform for histological evaluation of tissue called Clearing Histology with MultiPhoton Microscopy, or CHiMP. This platform has many advantages over traditional approaches, including same-day turn-around, reduced labor costs, preservation of tissue for DNA analysis, and direct-to-digital imaging for ease of consultation with remote experts. This proposal seeks to develop custom optics to enable very-high-resolution imaging of bone marrow and lymph node samples that are critical for diagnosing diseases such as leukemia and lymphoma.","New instrument and methods for fast, diagnostic-quality histology of un-embedded bone marrow and lymph node specimens",9677952,R43CA235890,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Ancillary Study', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Aspiration', 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Core Biopsy', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Decalcification', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hematopathology', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lymph', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Optics', 'Pan Genus', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'hematopoietic tissue', 'high resolution imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'instrument', 'lens', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'lymph nodes', 'medical specialties', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'pre-clinical', 'preservation', 'second harmonic', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,"APPLIKATE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2019,224713,0.014139346819975893
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children.

"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,9755492,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'automated analysis', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary plaque', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,756169,0.03506227529541687
"Deep LOGISMOS Abstract: This is a competitive continuation of a project that already yielded the highly flexible, accurate, and broadly applicable LOGISMOS framework for context-aware n-dimensional image segmentation. To substantially improve and extend its capability, we will develop Deep LOGISMOS that combines and reinforces the complementary advantages of LOGISMOS and deep learning (DL). There is growing need for quantitative failure-free 3D and higher-D image analysis for diagnostic and/or planning purposes. Examples of current use exist in radiation oncology, cardiology, ophthalmology and other areas of routine clinical medicine, many of which however still rely on manual slice-by-slice tracing. This manual nature of such analyses hinders their use in precision medicine. Deep LOGISMOS research proposed here will solve this problem and will offer routine efficient analysis of clinical images of analyzable quality. To stimulate a new phase of this research project, we hypothesize that: Advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms, when combined with deep-learning-derived application/modality specific parameters and allowing highly efficient expert-analyst guidance working in concert with the segmentation algorithms, will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired, complex, diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. The proposed research focuses on establishing an image segmentation and analysis framework combining the strengths of LOGISMOS and DL, developing a new way to efficiently generate training data necessary for learning from examples, forming a failure-free strategy for 3D, 4D, and generally n-D quantitative medical image analysis, and discovering ways for automated segmentation quality control. We will fulfill these specific aims:  1. Develop an efficient approach for building large segmentation training datasets in 3D, 4D, n-D  using assisted and suggestive annotations.  2. Develop Deep LOGISMOS, combining two well-established algorithmic strategies – deep learning  and LOGISMOS graph search.  3. Develop and validate methods employing deep learning for quality control of Deep LOGISMOS.  4. In healthcare-relevant applications, demonstrate that Deep LOGISMOS improves segmentation  performance in comparison with state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. Deep LOGISMOS will bring broadly available routine quantification of clinical images, positively impacting the role of reliable image-based information in tomorrow’s precision medicine. Narrative: Previous phases of this successful research project were devoted to the development of new graph-based methods for multi-surface and/or multi-object multi-dimensional biomedical image segmentation. Deep learning is emerging as an important new way to learn from large sets of examples. This proposal will combine deep learning and graph-based image analysis to maximize their combined strengths and overcome their individual weaknesses with the overarching goal to facilitate routine use of quantitative medical image analysis techniques in personalized medical care.",Deep LOGISMOS,9831425,R01EB004640,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fundus photography', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Ophthalmology', 'Organ', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Slice', 'Stroke', 'Suggestion', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Tissue', 'adjudication', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'diabetic', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'macular edema', 'n-dimensional', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'success', 'task analysis', 'treatment planning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,409911,-0.003302716694305508
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9663985,R01HL115828,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Sex Differences', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'aortic valve', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data archive', 'data pipeline', 'data sharing', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,740572,0.0200300196521124
"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice. There is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour organs at risk in medical images at a high degree of automation for impacting current practice of radiation therapy planning. Encouraged by strong competitive results from the Phase I part of this project, in this grant, further technical advances and a cloud-based software service are proposed. A multicenter clinical evaluation of the new product is also planned to assess the clinical efficacy of the system.",Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning,9761481,R42CA199735,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Blinded', 'Body Regions', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Object Attachment', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'software as a service', 'software development', 'software systems', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'virtual']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R42,2019,873369,0.015127382893758772
"Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK Abstract Thousands of medical researchers around the world use VTK —the Visualization Toolkit— an open-source, freely available software development toolkit providing advanced 3D interactive visualization, image processing and data analysis algorithms. They either use VTK directly in their in-house research applications or indirectly via one of the multitude of medical image analysis and bioinformatics applications that is built using VTK: Osirix, 3D Slicer, BioImageXD, MedINRIA, SCIRun, ParaView, and others. Furthermore, VTK also provides 3D visualizations for clinical applications such as BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system and Zimmer’s prosthesis design and evaluation platform. VTK has been downloaded many hundreds of thousands of times since its initial release in 1993. Considering its broad distribution and prevalent use, it can be argued that VTK has had a greater impact on medical research, and patient care, than any other open-source visualization package.  This proposal is in response to the multitude of requests we have been receiving from the VTK medical community. The aims are as follows:  1. Aim 1: Adaptive visualization framework: Produce an integrated framework that supports  visualization applications that balance server-side and client-side processing depending on data size,  analysis requirements, and the user platform (e.g., phone, tablet, or GPU-enabled desktop).  2. Aim 2: Integrated, interactive applications: Extend VTK to support a diversity of programming  paradigms ranging from C++ to JavaScript to Python and associated tools such as Jupyter Notebooks,  integrating with emerging technologies such as deep learning technologies.  3. Aim 3: Advanced rendering, including AR/VR: Target shader-based rendering systems and AR/VR  libraries that achieve high frame rates with minimal latency for ubiquitous applications that combine  low-cost, portable devices such as phones, ultrasound transducers, and other biometric sensors for  visually monitoring, guiding, and delivering advanced healthcare.  4. Aim 4: Infrastructure, Outreach, and Validation: Engage the VTK community and the proposed  External Advisory Board during the creation and assessment of the proposed work and corresponding  modern, digital documentation in the form of videos and interactive web-based content. Project Narrative The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software library for the interactive display and processing of medical images. It is being used in most major medical imaging research applications, e.g., 3D Slicer and Osirix, and in several commercial medical applications, e.g., BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system. VTK development began in 1993 and since then an extensive community of users and developers has grown around it. However, the rapid advancement of cloud computing, GPU hardware, deep learning algorithms, and VR/AR systems require corresponding advances in VTK so that the research and products that depend on VTK continue to deliver leading edge healthcare technologies. With the proposed updates, not only will existing applications continue to provide advanced healthcare, but new, innovative medical applications will also be inspired.",Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK,9740493,R01EB014955,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Augmented Reality', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biometry', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Publications', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cloud based', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'digital', 'health care delivery', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'open source', 'outreach', 'point of care', 'portability', 'processing speed', 'real world application', 'response', 'sensor', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend', 'virtual reality', 'web services']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2019,508446,0.007847010293634217
"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three‐dimensional (3D) whole‐brain imaging of non‐transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole‐brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo‐bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide‐spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state‐of‐the‐art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large‐scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,9677046,R44MH116827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2019,699967,-0.004361768601335295
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9669022,R01EB016695,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,569563,0.014227451200487686
"Expanding field-of-view with reduced tissue displacement in micro-endoscopic computational imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Optical imaging methods are well-established in neuroscience, but high-speed, high- resolution volumetric imaging of neural activity in deep tissue remains a challenge. A number of techniques address limited aspects of this goal, and most are applicable primarily to acute preparations. We propose to develop and test a novel approach to achieve three-dimensional “deep-tissue” imaging for high spatial and temporal resolution neural recording by combining aspects of embedded optical probes with computational imaging techniques. Rather than use a single micro-endoscopic probe, we propose to utilize an array of narrower probes, or optrodes, to reduce the volume of tissue displacement. Computational imaging through each probe can be performed to achieve a field of view (FOV) at a desired distance from the probe tip. Combining the fields of view from multiple probes arranged in an array then provides a composite image field that is much larger than achievable from a single micro-endoscope. In our approach, each ∼0.1 mm diameter probe of the array acts as an independent micro- endoscope. In order to achieve full-field imaging across the array, the individual fields must intersect, and the computational method must be scaled to accommodate, and stitch, multiple fields. In pursuit of these goals, we propose three Aims: Optimizing the FOV of a single micro-endoscope - The purpose of this Aim is to characterize the FOV for an individual probe at multiple depths, and optimize the FOV to about 0.3mm through control over the shape of the probe tip and light collection numerical aperture. Accelerating calibration and reconstruction - In this Aim, we will pursue efficient computational approaches for calibration based upon ray-tracing simulations and image reconstruction based on deep learning. Scaling the FOV with an endoscope array - The computational image reconstruction method will be scaled to accommodate small micro-endoscope arrays (e.g. 4 element) arranged in a hexagonal lattice with FOV of 0.6mm at a 1.5mm depth. NARRATIVE Imaging deep inside tissue, including the brain, is critical to understanding various biological processes. Doing so through a small probe is also of primary importance for minimizing tissue damage. In this proposal, we apply computational techniques to create fluorescent images using an array of microscopic glass needles to guide light in and out of a mouse brain. The simplicity and small footprint of our system have the potential for deep-brain imaging (depths > 1.5 mm) across a large (mm) field of view, which should enable a wide variety of biological and neuroscience studies in the future.",Expanding field-of-view with reduced tissue displacement in micro-endoscopic computational imaging,9829467,R21EY030717,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Coupled', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Endoscopes', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fluorescent Probes', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Holography', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Miniaturization', 'Mus', 'Needles', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Penetration', 'Preparation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'absorption', 'adaptive optics', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fluorescence imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'lens', 'microendoscope', 'multi-photon', 'neural circuit', 'novel strategies', 'optical fiber', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal rods', 'simulation', 'temporal measurement']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2019,456800,0.022263478229676687
"Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Diseases Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography (CEMRA) with gadolinium (Gd) provides high resolution visualization of the vascular compartment, but is rarely used in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). There is thus an unmet need to develop MRI techniques that can both replace Gd and provide new insights into the etiology and severity of CKD.  PI Sridhar and his team at Northeastern University (NEU) have developed a new technique, Quantitative Ultra-short Time-to-Echo Contrast-Enhanced (QUTE-CE) MRI, leads to quantifiable positive contrast images of the vasculature with unprecedented clarity and definition. QUTE-CE is particularly optimal using Ferumoxytol (Feraheme), an FDA approved iron-oxide nanopharmaceutical, that is already routinely used for iron-deficient anemia therapy in CKD patients. Under an ongoing clinical trial (NCT03266848) we have demonstrated QUTE- CE MRI for renal and cerebral imaging in humans at 3T.  This R21 project will develop the QUTE-CE MRI method for kidney imaging in patients with both normal kidney function as well as with CKD. We propose to scan 25 total patients (10 in Year 1 and 15 in Year 2) who are already scheduled to receive ferumoxytol infusion for iron-deficiency anemia therapy. The specific aims of this project are summarized below. Specific Aim 1: Renal Vascular Angiograms of CKD Patients. These studies will be conducted at NEU and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) using Siemens Prisma MRI scanners. Three tasks will be pursued to develop the optimizing protocol. Task 1: Develop a robust QUTE-CE imaging protocol. Task 2: Implement a robust methodology for accounting for B1 inhomogeneity. Task 3: Develop a robust trajectory for improved image reconstruction including motion correction. We hypothesize that QUTE-CE MRI will lead to high resolution angiograms that will allow for the safe diagnosis of existing pathologies such as renal artery stenosis in addition to the novel identification of kidney micro-vascular disease. Specific Aim 2: Obtain quantitative renal blood volume (RBV) maps and develop machine learning algorithms (MLA) to better understand the severity of kidney disease. The renal angiograms will be analyzed to obtain renal blood volume (RBV) maps. The RBV maps will be analyzed in terms of Machine-Learning algorithms (MLA) to explore whether we can identify common etiologies of CKD as well as estimate the severity of kidney disease. The MLA will enable organ segmentation, automatized renal parenchyma volumetry, as well as automated extraction and labeling of lesions. The MLA results will be compared with radiological scoring, estimated GFR, and degree of albuminuria. We hypothesize that the absolute RBV maps will enable quantitative monitoring of blood volume in cortex and medulla, and that RBV could be a surrogate parameter for renal microvascular rarefaction, a central mechanism in CKD initiation and progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE TITLE: Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Disease This project will develop a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging technique QUTE-CE MRI for studies of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The QUTE-CE MRI methodology provides very clear and high resolution angiographic images of vasculature using a safe and clinically approved nanoparticle contrast agent, that will transform standard of care by enabling diagnostic imaging for a large population of patients with CKD who cannot be imaged with the current gadolinium contrast agent due to its toxicity.",Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Diseases,9824779,R21DK118449,"['Accounting', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Cyst', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'FDA approved', 'Gadolinium', 'Gaussian model', 'General Hospitals', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infusion procedures', 'Iodine', 'Iron', 'Iron deficiency anemia', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis\xa0', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Toxicity', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Artery Stenosis', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Veins', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'expectation', 'ferumoxytol', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'iron oxide', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney imaging', 'kidney vascular structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanodrug', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'nuclear imaging', 'patient population', 'prisma', 'prognostic', 'standard of care']",NIDDK,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,220889,0.025908947988894808
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,9754130,R01EB009690,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'patient tolerability', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,683589,0.023138680989761743
"Quantitative topographic endoscopy for improved screening of non-polypoid colorectal neoplasms Project Summary This project will create and assess new optical imaging and computational technologies with the goal of improving the detection rates of precancerous, non-polypoid lesions during colonoscopy screening. Identifying and removing these subtle lesions is critical to improving the protective value of colonoscopy in reducing mortality from colorectal cancer. However, current approaches to non-polypoid lesion detection are largely unsuccessful because they are time-consuming and require specialized training (chromoendoscopy), or they start with poor image contrast (software analysis of conventional video). This project focuses on developing a novel technique, called quantitative topographic endoscopy (QTE), that optically measures colon surface properties via a modified commercial colonoscope. The key innovation in this proposal is to utilize structured illumination and build on concepts from computer vision and optical engineering to acquire high-resolution 3D images of the colon surface through a custom endoscope. The project will be implemented through three specific aims: (1) develop a miniaturized, quantitative, high-resolution topography system, (2) implement QTE in a modified commercial colonoscope ready for clinical testing, and (3) determine the validity of QTE in a phantom model and its clinical feasibility in a pilot human study. QTE systems developed in this project will be tested in tissue-mimicking phantoms with a goal of achieving better than 1-mm height sensitivity, in ex-vivo resected colon samples with a goal of accurately reconstructing surface shapes from a complex tissue, and in a pilot human study with the goal of obtaining surface topography non-polypoid lesions. Beyond increasing non-polypoid lesion detection rates, QTE has the potential to address other limitations of colonoscopy, including preventing missed polypoid lesions, classifying lesions for resect-and-discard strategies, and improving colonoscopy quality metrics. Additionally, the development of a QTE system that is approved for human studies will serve as a platform for future clinical assessment of other optical techniques such as spatial frequency domain imaging and speckle imaging in a variety of gastroenterology applications. Project Narrative Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Screening colonoscopy can significantly reduce mortality from colorectal cancer but is limited by high miss rates for precancerous non- polypoid lesions.

"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,9881453,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2019,397500,0.01655366523195308
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,9817807,R01AR074492,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Arthralgia', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Spur', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone remodeling', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Fluoride Ion', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Needs Assessment', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteotomy', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone', 'bone metabolism', 'cartilage metabolism', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'gait examination', 'gait retraining', 'imaging approach', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'joint loading', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mineralization', 'molecular marker', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'subchondral bone', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,561592,0.016154849533412015
"Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Project Summary     Coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves the lives of patients with coronary disease (CAD) as a group,  but 20% of patients remain symptomatic one year after surgery. In clinical practice CABG decisions are largely  driven by stenosis severity determined from invasive angiography despite the known relevance of functional  CAD  parameters.  This  practical  impasse  will  continue  to  exist  without  clinically  available,  high-­resolution,  quantitative functional imaging, and a better understanding of the clinical outcomes in relation to anatomical  (angiography)  and  functional  (ischemia,  scar  tissue)  factors.  The  long-­term  goal  is  to  improve  outcome  of  CABG  through  personalized  imaging-­guided  care.  The  overall  objective  of  this  proposal  is  to  identify  determinants  of  myocardial  flow  restoration  (ischemia  reduction),  and  develop  integrated  imaging  tools  for  individualized,  lesion-­specific  CABG  decision-­making,  and  computational  flow  simulations  based  on  the  patient’s  anatomy  and  function  to  predict  the  hemodynamic  outcome.  Supported  by  studies  using  invasive  FFR-­guided  CABG,  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  research  is  that  integration  of  anatomical  (angiography)  and functional information (ischemia, scar tissue) will identify individual coronary vessels that will benefit from  revascularization, and individual optimization of surgical procedures by flow simulations will maximize clinical  benefit  of  CABG  for  patients  with  CAD.  Supported  by  promising  preliminary  data,  three  specific  aims  are  proposed:  1)  Prospectively  identify  angiographic,  functional  and  clinical  baseline  determinants  of  outcome  after CABG, defined as improvement of myocardial perfusion (ischemia reduction) and angina symptoms;; 2)  Develop  and  validate  a  comprehensive  imaging  strategy  and  clinically  applicable  tool  that  integrate  high-­ resolution  angiographic  and  quantitative  functional  information  (ischemia,  viability)  for  per-­vessel/lesion  revascularization  decisions;;  3)  Develop  and  validate  new  multi-­parametric  computational  flow  simulations,  with incorporation of functional imaging data, which allows for prediction of individual hemodynamic outcome  and  ultimately  surgical  optimization  based  on  virtual  hemodynamic  results.  This  approach  is  innovative  because  new  imaging  techniques  will  advance  the  field’s  understanding  of  CABG  physiology,  and  new  clinically applicable tools will be developed for comprehensive clinical decision-­making and optimized surgical  planning. The acquired knowledge and developed tools are applicable to other vascular contexts, and may  also  be  instrumental  for  new  therapeutic  innovations.  The  proposed  research  is  significant  because  identification  of  CABG  outcome  determinants,  and  new  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance,  have  the  potential  to  improve  the  effectiveness  (by  complete  functional  revascularization)  and  efficiency  of  CABG  (by  avoiding  futile  grafts).  For  a  large  group  of  patients,  these  innovations  will improve  the patient-­valued  benefit  of  CABG (complications, symptoms),  and also decrease  cost by improved efficiency of care.     Project Narrative    The proposed research is relevant to the public health because identification of CABG outcome determinants,  and  development  of  diagnostic  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance  of  CABG  surgery,  can  help  achieve  complete  functional  revascularization  and  restoration  of  myocardial  blood  flow  in  more  patients.  Thus,  the  proposed  research  is  relevant  to  the  NIH’s  mission  that  pertains  to  the  discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of  that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. ",Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery,9660276,R01HL141712,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intuition', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity -

"Development and Dissemination of Clinical CEST MRI Acquisition and Analysis Methods for Cancer Imaging Applications This research plan will continue our development of Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI acquisition and analysis methods for imaging patients with cancer. AcidoCEST MRI with an exogenous contrast agent is an innovative variation of this technique that measures extracellular pH in solid tumors. We have also developed an exceptionally innovative method that acquires endogenous CEST MR images with multiple powers, which can measure the chemical exchange rate of endogenous proteins that can assess relative differences in pH. We will improve our CEST MRI acquisition methods by accelerating the imaging speed, reducing and eliminating complications due to patient motion, eliminating complications caused by fat signal, and expanding to 3D imaging methods. We will also improve image analysis methods that are required for CEST contrast from endogenous proteins and exogenous contrast agents.  Our research has strong impact because acidoCEST MRI can track changes in tumor acidosis in response to chemotherapy and chemoradiation therapy in patients who have breast cancer and head & neck cancer. Endogenous CEST MRI can improve the diagnoses of brain tumor recurrence vs. pseudoprogression, and evaluations of lung cancer vs. lung infection. We will perform clinical studies with our endogenous and exogenous CEST MRI methods to image patients with brain, breast, lung, and head & neck cancers.  To amplify the impact of our research, we will develop versions of our CEST MRI acquisition methods for the many versions of the 13 Siemens hardware platforms and software operating systems at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. We will also develop user-friendly CEST analysis methods for many researchers at MD Anderson. We will leverage our unique research environment and expertise with intra-institutional dissemination to provide inter-institutional dissemination, by sharing share these acquisition and analysis tools with other CEST MRI researchers. We will collaborate with NIST to provide the first CEST MRI phantom that can standardize the development and implementation of intra- and inter-institutional CEST MRI methods.  Our team of outstanding investigators includes experts in CEST saturation methods, CEST MR image analysis, clinical contrast agents, rapid MRI acquisition methods, high field 7T MRI, clinical radiology, biostatistics, histopathology and oncology. Based on our expertise and years of productivity in clinical CEST MRI, we have developed an exceptional research approach. As the world's largest cancer center and a health destination, the MD Anderson Cancer Center has the patient population that provides very strong institutional support for our clinical studies. NARRATIVE We will develop new acquisition and analysis methods that assess tumor acidosis with CEST MRI, using exogenous CEST agents and endogenous sources of CEST contrast. We will apply our new methods to evaluate tumor acidosis in patients with breast, head & neck, lung, and brain cancers. We will disseminate our CEST MRI acquisition and analysis methods to other CEST MRI researchers, along with a NIST-approved standard for clinical CEST MRI studies.",Development and Dissemination of Clinical CEST MRI Acquisition and Analysis Methods for Cancer Imaging Applications,9671020,R01CA231513,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Center', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Custom', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fingerprint', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Head Cancer', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Implant', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Lung infections', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Neck Cancer', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operating System', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemical standard', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'extracellular', 'frontier', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'ovarian neoplasm', 'patient population', 'preclinical study', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2019,652625,-0.026675362608398562
"A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ultimate goal is to improve our ability to create and measure 3D models derived from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Our main motivation is to improve quality and reduce costs in care of patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities. The resulted innovations will also impact other fields. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffered from CMF deformities. The evaluation of these patients includes an assessment of CMF form on 3D models that are traditionally generated from segmented spiral multi-slice CTs (MSCTs). These models are also used to plan their treatment. The purpose of segmentation is to separate different anatomical structures and to remove the artifacts on the CTs. Once 3D models are generated from the segmented CTs, anatomical and teeth landmarks are manually digitized for measurements. Finally, diagnosis and treatment planning are performed based on measurements. Although MSCT provides high- quality images and thus allows relatively fast and easy post processing, many concerns have been raised on excessive radiation exposure to patients. Therefore, more doctors are now using CBCT scanners in their offices. CBCT has less radiation and is inexpensive compared to the MSCT, but their use in generating 3D models is greatly limited by the poor image quality, i.e., low contrast / signal-to-noise ratio and artifacts. Thus, the existing automated segmentation algorithms developed for MSCT are incapable of practically segmenting CBCTs. The current solution to CBCT segmentation entails an arduous and lengthy process that involves labor-intensive manual editing of hundreds of slices. Besides, another arduous and inaccurate task in the assessment of CMF deformities is the digitization of anatomical landmarks on 3D models - the first step to quantify the deformities. Currently a typical 3D cephalometric and teeth analysis requires the manual digitization of more than 200 landmarks, which is time consuming and has limited accuracy. We hypothesize that the creation and measurement of high-quality 3D models can be significantly improved by developing innovative CBCT-friendly post processing tools. Therefore, in this renewal project, we propose to develop and validate a novel CBCT analysis platform to automate the process of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization. The feasibility of our approaches has already been proven by our preliminary studies. Our innovative CBCT analysis platform will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals with CMF conditions. It will change our dental/CMF fields in effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for on-the-fly diagnosis and treatment planning. With minimal user intervention, the computer will accurately and effectively do the work, which is currently artistically done by the labor-intensive human operators. The resulted innovations may also impact other fields in the future, e.g., orthopedic surgery and cardiovascular surgery where intraoperative whole-body CBCT is acquired for image-guided surgery and intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in physician's offices for orthodontics, craniomaxillofacial (CMF) surgery, facial plastic surgery and dentistry, but its segmentation and landmark digitization have to be completed artistically by human operators, which is labor-intensive and with limited accuracy.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative CBCT post processing system to automate the processes of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization with minimal user intervention.  The proposed system will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals  with CMF conditions, and also change 1) the fields of orthodontics, CMF surgery and general dentistry in  effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for diagnosis and treatment planning, and 2) the fields of orthopedic  surgery, general surgery, and cardiovascular surgery where the quality and the speed of intraoperative  imaging is critical.",A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities,9624752,R01DE022676,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Deformity', 'Dental Care', 'Dentistry', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Jaw', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Orthodontics', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Plastic Surgical Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'care costs', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'design', 'detector', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,490358,0.010922834480668785
"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders. This project will develop a robust noninvasive imaging technique using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that offers high spatial resolution, resistance to head motion and accurate quantification of cerebral blood flow in children and adolescents.

"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop 3-D imaging flow cytometry platforms for fluorescent or absorbing (stained) cells at high resolution and high throughput in a flow configuration. The developed systems will be built upon two novel snapshot 3-D techniques developed by the PI in combination with most rigorous 3-D optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies.

"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET. While the imaging developments are generally applicable to all PET tracers in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, since cancer is the primary clinical application of PET, we will focus our investigation and optimization in this project on three lung cancer imaging tracers at different clinical adoption stages as examples: 1) 18F-FDG as a routine clinical tracer, 2) 18F-FMISO for hypoxia studies as a tracer for human research, and 3) 18F-PD-L1 that specifically binds to human PD-L1 in tumors and other organs as a recent first-in-human tracer. For each tracer, we will investigate 1) static PET, 2) gated and respiratory motion corrected PET, and 3) dynamic PET. Project narrative Patient radiation dose is a major concern in PET imaging.

"A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain Project Summary  In this project, we propose to validate and characterize ﬁber orientation estimation from diffusion tensor imag- ing (DTI) through the optimization of a multi-modality, multi-scale imaging pipeline for whole mouse brains. DTI is a powerful tool used to noninvasively report 3D microstructural properties of nervous tissue on a macroscopic scale, and has played an important role in the understanding and diagnosis of a number of neurological disease processes. Modern acquisitions of DTI data can be processed to generate a 3D diffusion proﬁle known as an orientation diffusion function (ODF) at each voxel. The ODF is used to infer the orientation of local axon ﬁber pop- ulations. Previous efforts to validate these orientation estimates have primarily relied on serial optical histology as a ground truth dataset. Histology-based pipelines involve the labor intensive task of physically sectioning the tissue into thin slices, leading to physical destruction of the sample and anisotropic resolution. These limitations potentially confound the accuracy of 3D orientation estimation, complicate the process of spatially registering the ground-truth and DTI datasets, and limit quantitative comparisons to select regions of interest (ROI) across the brain sample.  In recent years, synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) has emerged as a powerful tool for high-resolution tissue imaging. With a mosaic projection-stitching method, a whole mouse brain can be imaged at an isotropic, 3D resolution of 1.2 microns after prior imaging with DTI. To enhance microCT contrast, the tis- sue specimens are ﬁxed and stained with the same kind of metal-based stains used in electron microscopy (EM) prior to embedding in resin. We will optimize this microCT-EM validation pipeline to address the limitations of pre- vious histology-based studies, and characterize DTI algorithm performance across a whole mouse brain using micron- to nano-scale neurological information.  The speciﬁc aims of the proposal are: (1) model phase contrast to optimize microCT data acquisition, (2) vali- date DTI ODF reconstruction methods using ground-truth microCT (3) characterize DTI performance using under- lying tissue microstructure information from EM. Upon completion, aim 1 will generate a novel theoretical model and acquisition strategy to exploit microCT phase contrast in strongly absorbing biological samples. Aim 2 will generate a ground-truth dataset of ODFs across a whole mouse brain, which will be used to calculate algorithm- speciﬁc spatial maps of DTI performance. In Aim 3, around 20 ROI will be selected for nano-scale imaging with EM, and DTI performance will be characterized by quantitative features of the underlying neural architecture. These results will provide an unprecedented microstructure-driven understanding of the DTI signal, allowing fu- ture studies to develop more advanced DTI models and acquisition strategies to better leverage ﬁber orientation and connectivity information in the treatment of neurological disease. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to use synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography and serial electron microscopy to validate diffusion MRI reconstruction methods. This unprecedented pipeline allows for imaging the same tissue across scales ranging from hundreds of microns to tens of nanometers. The high resolution modalities will provide insight into the true neurological microstructure driving the diffusion MRI signal, leading to better modeling and increased clinical and research utility.","A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain",9836456,F31NS113571,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mus', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurologic', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plant Resins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'absorption', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'electron tomography', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'nanometer', 'nanoscale', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'tractography', 'validation studies']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2019,39994,-0.011481202949634782
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly. This project will develop automated tools to increase measurement throughput, and explore new image-based biomarkers that will significantly add to the assessment of patient prognosis, and will have the ability to more quickly judge the effectiveness of interventions.",Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD,9782929,K01DK110136,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'FarGo', 'Fibrosis', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Tissue', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Spin Labels', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'educational atmosphere', 'functional decline', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'kidney vascular structure', 'knowledge base', 'novel imaging technology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'prognostic value', 'radiological imaging', 'renal artery', 'research study', 'shear stress', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K01,2019,154915,0.027022288502870057
"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,9600285,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Breast biopsy', 'Bypass', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interventional Ultrasonography', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver diseases', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Needles', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'North America', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readability', 'Resolution', 'Retroperitoneal Space', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgical Instruments', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fetal', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,194115,0.013606083772774813
"Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors Project Summary/Abstract One of the key advances in modern positron emission tomography (PET) systems for clinical imaging is the use of time-of-flight (TOF) information. In cancer imaging TOF provides superior lesion detection and more accurate quantification that is crucial in measuring response to therapy, as well as in neurological and cardiovascular imaging applications. An additional benefit of TOF is the ability to lower the radiation dose or scan time without sacrificing image quality, important for patient safety and comfort. The magnitude of these clinical benefits is determined by the TOF resolution of the PET detectors, therefore the prospect of achieving unprecedented image quality and clinical imaging capabilities with superior TOF resolution has fueled significant research in developing detector technology for TOF-PET systems. However, these developments have been largely unaccompanied by advances in signal processing methods needed to extract TOF information from the detector’s electrical signals, with most detectors making use of crude analog algorithms that discard most of the useful timing information contained in the signals. Now, with the availability of low-cost fast waveform digitizers, there is an exciting opportunity to implement sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to achieve superior TOF resolution. The main advantage of developing advanced signal processing algorithms is that it presents a cost-effective route to improved TOF resolution that is complementary to instrumentation innovations. In essence, the TOF gain comes for free; the detector signals already contain the information needed for better TOF resolution, it just needs to be used effectively. Here we propose to tailor deep learning techniques to estimate TOF from the detector signals. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a powerful approach to learn complex representations of input data that can be used for tasks such as classification and regression. CNNs are therefore very suitable for directly estimating TOF from the detector waveforms, since these waveforms are influenced by several complex and intertwined processes which are hard to accurately model. Furthermore, large amounts of ground truth training data are readily generated. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of CNN-based TOF estimation, and found up to 23% improvement in TOF resolution compared to standard signal processing methods. This proposal aims to optimize these methods to push the limits of achievable TOF resolution and develop methods for their practical implementation. First, we will develop CNN architectures and methods suitable for silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) that are now used in modern TOF-PET systems. We will also optimize the digitizing parameters to make optimal use of CNNs for TOF estimation. Second, we will implement CNN-TOF methods in a modern commercial PET detector, including using a global CNN to simultaneously estimate TOF and the crystal-of-interaction from the detector waveforms, demonstrating the practical feasibility of using this promising deep learning method in next generation PET systems. Narrative The use of time-of-flight information in positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful way to increase clinical imaging capabilities of PET, and is now used in most modern systems. Improving time-of-flight performance promises to provide substantial benefits for lesion detection in cancer imaging, kinetic modeling with dynamic imaging, and the use of lower radiation dose for patient safety. Here we introduce deep learning signal processing methods to significantly improve the performance of time-of-flight PET detectors without requiring new materials, which thereby represents a cost effective route towards maximizing the use of the rich imaging signal provided by time-of-flight.",Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors,9651713,R03EB027268,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Dose', 'Electronics', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'analog', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical imaging', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'photomultiplier', 'physical process', 'response', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'time use', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2018,78500,0.04204716626080401
"Protected Radiomics Analysis Commons for Deep Learning in Biomedical Discovery Abstract  Development of emerging imaging systems for biological and medical imaging often involves multi-dimensional acquisition protocols and thus correspondingly the need for complex reconstruction algorithms and advanced machine learning algorithms in order to produce the desired resulting image and quantitative tumor characteristics. This proposal requests funding for a high performance computing system, entitled Protected Radiomics Analysis Commons for Deep Learning in Biomedical Discovery, to further the development and application of deep learning techniques to quantitative image analysis and image reconstruction.

"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning,9599417,R01EB025220,"['Acetazolamide', 'Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'ImProv', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Japanese Population', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Premenopause', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Spin Labels', 'Stress Tests', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Waste Products', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Xenon', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'cerebrovascular imaging', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'design', 'direct application', 'disability', 'evidence based guidelines', 'gender difference', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'men', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'response', 'stressor', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'time use', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,653337,-0.0684701369559966
"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9521289,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,471965,0.04103053945066021
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,9524253,R01CA218187,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,684119,-0.011500104716954888
"MRI near Total Joint replacements Project Abstract Overview: The parent project for this supplement aims to provide routine MRI of subjects with total joint replacements by reducing the severe image artifacts near metal, while offering highly efficient patient-specific scans that can detect bone loss, infection, and temperature changes near the implant in clinically feasible scan times. The supplement aims to incorporate deep learning techniques to better meet the parent grant goals. Relevance: Total joint replacements are one of the most successful orthopedic procedures, used annually to reduce pain from joint diseases in about one million patients in the United States (a number projected to double by 2030). However, about 10% of joint replacements fail in 5-10 years due to bone loss (osteolysis), infection, or other complications, often leading to revision surgery. Accurate, early, non-invasive assessment of complications remains limited, but would offer earlier and less invasive treatments, reduce unnecessary surgery, or allow better surgical planning. Approach: Prior to, and during the parent grant period, we have developed novel “multi-spectral imaging” (MSI) MRI techniques that allow visualization of pathology adjacent to metallic implants, and together with other groups have successfully applied them to imaging of patients with devices including joint replacements and spinal fixation hardware. However these methods remain slow, have limited spatial resolution, and are challenging to use routinely. The recent growth of the machine learning field including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and its application to medical imaging offers unique opportunities to substantially improve MRI near metal, and specifically the goals of the parent grant. We propose 3 small, independent aims in the supplement: (1) to bring fast, isotropic imaging near metal to clinical practice by using CNN-based methods to reduce reconstruction times to under 30 seconds, (2) to improve image quality away from metal by using a new reconstruction and CNN to avoid needing standard imaging in addition to MSI methods and (3) to reduce background-gradient induced artifacts near to metal using a CNN-based approach to enable better diagnosis of abnormalities adjacent to metal. Summary: We aim to supplement our parent grant with CNN-based approaches to speed up scanning and image reconstruction, and to improve image quality near to and way from metal. These techniques will allow routine, non-invasive evaluation for earlier and more accurate detection and treatment of complications in these patients, as well as numerous other applications of MRI near metal implants. Project Narrative There is a growing need for accurate diagnosis of complications surrounding joint arthroplasty, where MRI would provide excellent contrast if not for the fact that the presence of metal severely degrades images. Building on recent ideas in MRI and deep learning, we propose to develop practical methods for routine clinical imaging of patients with metal implants by increasing speed as well as offering image contrast that shows infection and other complications near the metal devices. Ultimately these methods will be tested and offered for widespread use to enable earlier and better treatment of complications resulting from arthroplasty, as well as for better understanding of the implications of different devices.",MRI near Total Joint replacements,9750463,R01EB017739,"['Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Infection', 'Joint repair', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Osteolysis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Stretching', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arthropathies', 'bone loss', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'field study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'pain reduction', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'spectrograph']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,156870,0.03232430900676967
"Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography (PET) is a high-sensitivity molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, with the ability to observe molecular-level activities inside a living body through the injection of specific radioactive tracers. In addition to the commonly used F-18-FDG, new tracers are being constantly developed and investigated to pinpoint specific pathways in various diseases. New PET scanners are also being proposed by exploiting time of flight (TOF) information, enabling depth of interaction capability, and extending the solid angle coverage. To realize the full potential of the new PET tracers and scanners, there is an increasing need for the development of advanced image reconstruction methods. This grant application proposes a new framework for regularized image reconstruction that synergistically integrates deep learning and regularized image reconstruction. The new framework is enabled by the recent advances in machine learning, which provide a tool to digest vast amount information embedded in existing medical images. The proposed method embeds a pre-trained deep neural network in an iterative image reconstruction framework and uses the deep neural network to regularize PET image directly. By training the deep neural network with a large amount of high-quality low-noise PET images, the proposed method can capture complex prior information from existing inter-subject and intra-subject data and thus is expected to substantially outperform the current state-of-the-art regularized image reconstruction method. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop the theoretical framework to synergistically integrate deep learning in regularized image reconstruction for PET and (2) to implement the proposed method and validate its effectiveness using existing animal data. Once the proposed method is validated using existing animal data, we will seek funding to acquire necessary human data for the implementation of the proposed method on clinical PET scanners. Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique widely used in clinic for detecting cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. This project will develop an innovative image reconstruction method that has potential to improve PET image quality and reduce radiation dose. Its success will improve the accuracy of PET for cancer detection and other diseases.",Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography,9586688,R21EB026668,"['Advanced Development', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Radioactive Tracers', 'Rattus', 'Role', 'Solid', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'animal data', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2018,221250,0.025303039569380154
"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET in PET/MR and target delineation in radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from MR-only data.

"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current clinical image modalities can be utilized to develop patient-specific computational models to pre-operatively plan transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. However, the computational modeling and simulation processes are time-consuming, which limits clinical translatability. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop algorithms using machine learning techniques to rapidly process and predict TAVR computational simulation outcomes directly from clinical image data.",A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes,9518217,R01HL142036,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Extravasation', 'Feedback', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Valves', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Postoperative Period', 'Problem Sets', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Response Elements', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stents', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'calcification', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'population based', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'speech recognition', 'time resolved data', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual clinical trial']",NHLBI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,392932,0.009618845759383687
"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9527787,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,347700,0.0070953223505830785
"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.!",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,9724174,R61AR073552,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2018,24598,0.033304320246295406

"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration.

"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9659850,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,593526,-0.013932404141745075

"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9587091,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,185264,0.035148176148229966
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9640372,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,347584,-0.005516478173761378
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,9594042,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,661507,-0.0015947503025370898
"New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging Project Summary To more fully exploit the basic science of mechanobiology as it pertains to breast cancer progression, the medical imaging field continues to search for fast, safe, and effective elasticity imaging methods. In this project we propose a fundamentally new approach to ultrasonic elasticity imaging in which the weak forces applied to patient tissues and the measured displacements that result are used to train a numerical model specifically for that patient. This constitutive model is developed using finite-element methods and neural networks assembled in a unique configuration called the AutoProgressive (AutoP) Method. AutoP “learns” complete stress and strain properties directly from sparse force and displacement measurements and without a mathematical model. Using quasi-static stimuli, AutoP exploits the fact that each force-displacement estimate contains information about mechanical properties at all locations in the contiguous tissue. From measurement information and conservation laws, AutoP generates an informational model without the need to make assumptions about tissue linearity, isotropy, or other material properties normally required when constructing images that display tissue mechanical properties. Once an accurate material-property model is formed by AutoP, we adopt a separate rheological model (e.g., Kelvin Voigt) to form viscoelastic parameters for image display. The AutoP method employs beamformed RF-echo acquisitions from which point displacements are estimated, applied compressional force sensed at the transducer surface, and tissue shape.  No other imaging method is capable of estimating all relevant stress fields, which gives AutoP unique capabilities. AutoP estimates the mechanical properties that one strives to obtain from an inverse problem approach, but AutoP is not a mathematical inverse technique and hence does not suffer from nonunique solutions. Without the need to assume material properties, AutoP can (in principle) model tissue properties in three dimensions and in time following large deformations in highly-nonlinear, anisotropic media. This R21 proposal focuses on establishing the feasibility of the AutoP methodology for subsequent clinical trials under future funding. At the completion of this two-year project, we will demonstrate a new tool for medical imaging capable of exploring the mechanical properties of tissues over a very broad range of deformations. We specifically target ultrasonic methods and quasi-static force stimuli in this project. However AutoP could eventually be coupled to other imaging modalities (e.g., MRE, OCE) or dynamic force-stimulus methods.  The scientific premise underlying AutoP is that we already record all of the information needed to generate a very broad range of elasticity images. The key to unlocking this information is to set aside mathematical models in favor of data-driven informational models built using the unique machine learning abilities of the AutoP method. If successful, AutoP will have a major influence on medical elasticity imaging methods. Project Narrative: A new type of machine-learning method is proposed for elasticity imaging of patient tissues that offers the potential to minimize many current limitations. If we are successful in this development, ultrasonic elasticity imaging would significantly improve in its ability to accurately represent mechanical properties of breast tissues, without any changes in current instrumentation and without increasing cost to the healthcare system or adding risk to patients.",New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging,9560761,R21EB023402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Isotropy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modulus', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Writing', 'aged', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'breast imaging', 'cost', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'imaging properties', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical properties', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel strategies', 'object shape', 'processing speed', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'viscoelasticity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2018,179876,-0.00016025558199097152
"2018 Image Science Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar Project Summary: The proposal requests support for early-career investigators to attend the 2018 Gordon Research Conference on Image Science. The unique feature of this conference in its third offering compared with others in medical imaging is the bringing together of renown speakers from disparate application areas, including astronomy, biology, medicine, remote sensing, and security and defense industries, in a forum that encourages each to describe their greatest challenges and most promising solutions. All speakers are invited based on their leadership in their field and their willingness to debate fundamental issues shared by everyone developing, evaluating, and applying imaging in medicine and biology. We believe the GRC format placed in the context of a small-college venue promotes the type of innovative interdisciplinary thinking that leads to breakthroughs. An environment where leading senior scientists debate core issues is valuable to young investigators trying to build successful independent careers in medical imaging in industry and academia. All attendees are invited to present a poster describing their research in poster sessions that are a key element of the Gordon Conference format. The June 17-22, 2018 GRC conference theme is “Image Science: Creating Knowledge from Information,” which is focused on appropriate acquisition and efficient uses of the massive volume of imaging information now collected from patients. Speakers give 40 minutes presentations in a single-track format with 20 minute discussions following each presentation that are led by experts in the field. Topic range from “Imaging in Brain Science Discovery” to “Advanced Machine Learning” and “Computational Imaging.” At the center of each presentation is a discussion of the core challenges shared by image scientists and novel techniques for acquiring and displaying information in a manner that maximizes decision performance. Given the success of the previous meeting, we will hold the first-ever, student-run Gordon Research Seminars (GRS) on Image Science June 16, 17, 2018. Our aim is to build Image Science as an independent field of study through detailed interdisciplinary discussions and by fostering the success of a new generation of image scientists. Project Narrative: Solutions to very difficult problems often emerge from discussions among experts in different fields of study being challenged by the same core problems. The 2018 GRC on Imaging Science strives to build a community of problem solvers by creating an environment for detailed discussions among senior investigators that involves young investigators at a time when they are building careers.

"2018 International Molecular and Functional Pulmonary Imaging Workshop SUMMARY This application requests funding to support the 2018 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging, a three- day meeting scheduled for December 6-8, 2018, which will be the sixth of its kind hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. The requested funds will primarily be used to cover travel and housing expenses for undergraduate, graduate and junior faculty speakers. Some may also be used to support live webcasting and publication of the workshop proceedings. As in the past, it is our intention to broadcast each session of the meeting online in real-time, enabling interested parties who cannot physically attend to access them free of charge. Pulmonary diseases constitute a significant and rising cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and imaging is becoming an increasingly important source of innovative techniques for both diagnosing and treating these pathologies. The field of pulmonary imaging currently encompasses a wider range of techniques for the functional, structural and molecular assessment of lung disorders than ever before, which are being developed and refined by investigators across a diverse set of fields such as biology, physics, chemistry, medicine and engineering, computer science and machine learning. Given the rapidly-developing nature of the pulmonary imaging field, it is of the utmost importance that a regular forum exists for scientists and clinicians to communicate and debate their ideas with one another. In the absence of other meetings with a similar focus, our previous workshops have provided such a forum, bringing together the diverse components of the field into the kind of rigorous, focused exchange needed to advance the field. The specific aims of the proposed workshop are as follows: (1) keep the pulmonary imaging community informed about the latest developments in structural, functional and molecular lung imaging; (2) examine the use of pulmonary imaging to assess therapeutic response, including strategies for overcoming the challenges inherent in this objective; (3) explore the integration of machine learning with pulmonary imaging techniques to more accurately phenotype disease and predict injury progression; (4) broadcast the entire proceedings live over the web, allowing non-attendees to freely access the proceedings, and enabling the online audience to participate in workshop discussions in real-time. Based on feedback from participants that previous meetings tended to be overly dense and predominantly didactic in nature, we have also implemented a significant format change for proposed 2018 meeting. With the exception of a few keynote presentations, we plan to limit the percentage of formal lecture in each invited speaker’s talk to one-third of their allotted time, with the rest dedicated to a period of discussion that will be driven by a panel of moderators as well as audience questions. For each presentation, the moderators will prepare a list of questions focusing on three main points: 1) the translatability of the research being presented, 2) the scientific gap which this research aims to address, and 3) the necessity of identifying lung disorders that are suitable for longitudinal studies, as well as which imaging parameters are best suited to the longitudinal study of lung disease. In addition to this change in format, the 2018 workshop will continue efforts to strike a more even balance between functional, structural and molecular imaging approaches to pulmonary disease. Finally, we will also continue to foreground the important issue of using imaging techniques to assess treatment response, which was first introduced at the 2017 pulmonary imaging workshop. NARRATIVE This application requests funding to support the 2018 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging at the University of Pennsylvania. The proposed meeting will provide a valuable opportunity for researchers engaged in the development of functional, structural, and molecular imaging techniques for assessing lung diseases—such as COPD, ARDS, IPF and lung cancer—to meet and discuss their work with one another. The entirety of the workshop will be broadcast live online, giving interested individuals who are not able to attend in person the ability to both view and participate in its proceedings.",2018 International Molecular and Functional Pulmonary Imaging Workshop,9613494,R13HL144010,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Heart', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intention', 'International', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Protons', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Pulmonology', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lectures', 'lung imaging', 'meetings', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'patient response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'treatment response', 'undergraduate student']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R13,2018,29805,-0.04011045354940149

Two of these meetings, Optical Tomography and Spectroscopy (OTS) and Microscopy, Histopathology and Analytics (Microscopy) provide broad exposure to a very active multidisciplinary field in biomedical imaging and bioengineering focused on illness treatment and health enhancement. The interdisciplinary nature of the co- located meetings will provide cross-fertilization of concepts and techniques between fields with the resulting synergies obtained from such interactions. This proposal is to provide registration and travel support for students and early career professionals presenting at one of these topical meetings.  OTS will focus on new developments in diffuse optics, spectroscopy and other non- invasive tomographic imaging approaches, including the fields of diffuse optical tomography (DOT), photoacoustic tomography (PAT), optical coherence tomography (OCT), wavefront engineering to overcome scattering, as well as new developments in spectroscopic technologies.  Microscopy will include topics central to the development of optical microscopy and in vitro optical sensing for the clinic. Areas such as novel optical approaches, including computational optics, new image processing and segmentation techniques, development of decision-assistance algorithms via machine-learning and other strategies, testing technologies in pre-clinical models, applications to clinical samples, and validation in the clinic will be discussed. Optically enabled microfluidics are included in this track as well. The goal of these efforts should be towards clinical translation.  The general purpose of these meetings is to create an inclusive, open forum for the presentation of high-quality scientific research through plenary and technical sessions, short courses, panels, networking and special events. This method of face-to-face information sharing allows researchers to learn what others in their field and related disciplines are doing and to efficiently learn about new research, tools, and techniques that might be relevant to their work. It allows conversations with colleagues from different institutions around the world and engenders far reaching scientific collaborations – both domestic and international.

"A TOF, DOI, MRI compatible PET detector to support sub-millimeter neuroPET imaging Abstract The overall goal of this research is to develop next generation positron emission tomography (PET) detector technology to support non-invasive, quantitative brain imaging at spatial and temporal resolutions currently not achievable with human neuro-PET systems. The developed PET detector technology will also be compatible with operation in an MRI system. The proposed research is targeted to the NIH Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative. Human brain imaging with PET/MRI will be an essential tool in neuroscience studies to ""Develop innovative technologies to understand the human brain and treat its disorders; create and support integrated brain research networks."" The key advancement that we introduce is a PET detector with <100 psec time-of-flight (TOF) PET coincidence resolution, <2 mm continuous depth of interaction (DOI) positioning and intrinsic detector spatial resolution to support <1 mm PET image resolution throughout the system imaging field of view (FOV). Detector modules have been designed that individually achieve these performance metrics; however, no detector module has been designed that supports all of them. To make disruptive advancements in neuro-imaging using PET, one must push the image spatial resolution (i.e., currently 2-3 mm image resolution) as well as coincidence timing resolution and also be MRI compatible. The impact of this project is that we will advance the state of the art in all of these critical performance areas. We will achieve these goals by first understanding the role that different PET detector performance parameters have on task-based figures of merit for neuroPET imaging. We will investigate how both TOF and image resolution impact figure of merit performance for estimation, detection and characterization imaging tasks. Monte Carlo simulation will be used along with both object-based (i.e., mathematical) and anthropomorphic digital phantoms. Next we will optimize SiPM device selection, electronics and detector geometry for <100 psec TOF coincidence timing, 1 mm intrinsic spatial resolution and <2 mm DOI positioning resolution. We will build and characterize a prototype PET detector module utilizing a novel dual- sided slat crystal detector design. To advance coincidence timing performance we will investigate the use of machine learning to estimate the arrival time of detected events. Finally, we will optimize the detector design for MRI compatibility. We will fully test and characterize performance of our prototype detector on the benchtop and in a MRI scanner while running clinical MRI pulse sequences. At the end of this developmental project we will be in position to build a state of the art, MRI compatible, TOF, DOI PET imaging system. Narrative The overall goal of this work is to develop detector imaging technology that will enable new research into the development, function and aging of the human brain. This technology will allow functional imaging of the brain at higher spatial resolution and higher coincidence timing resolution than previously achieved and also facilitate simultaneous multi-modality imaging (i.e., PET/MRI) at these new levels of performance.","A TOF, DOI, MRI compatible PET detector to support sub-millimeter neuroPET imaging",9616697,R01EB026964,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Side', 'Silicon', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging detector', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'operation', 'prototype', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,29442,0.005191868789122557
"mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment Project Summary NIH is increasing its investment in large mutli-center brain MRI studies via projects such as the recently announced BRAIN initiative. The success of these studies depends on the quality of MRIs and the resulting image measurements, regardless of sample size. Even though quality control of MRIs and corresponding measurements could be outsourced, most neuroscience studies rely on in-house procedures that combine automatically generated scores with manually guided checks, such as visual inspection. Implementing these procedures typically requires combining several open-source software systems. For example, the NIH NIAAA and BD2K funded Data Analysis Resource (DAR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) uses XNAT to consolidate the structural, diffusion, and functional MRIs acquired across five sites, and has also developed their own custom software package to comply with study requirements that called for a multi-tier, quality control (QC) workflow. However, these custom, one-off tools lack support for multi-site QC workflows as that would require a unified platform, design that supports collaboration and sharing, and strong cohesion between technologies. To improve the effectiveness of QC efforts specific to multi-center neuroimaging studies, we will develop a widely accessible and broadly compatible software platform that supports simplified creation of custom QC workflows in compliance with study requirements, provides core functionality for performing QC of medical images, and automatically generates documentation compliant with the FAIR principle, i.e., making scientific findings findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  Specifically, our multi-site open-source software platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (mIQa) will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by leveraging open-source, state-of-the-art web interface technologies, such as a web-based dataset caching system, machine learning to aid in QC process, and an interactive electronic notebook platform. Users will be able to configure workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of medical imaging studies but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans. Issue tracking technology will enhance communication between geographically-distributed team members, as they can easily share image annotations and receive automating notifications of outstanding QC issues. The system will be easy to deploy as it will be able to interface with various imaging storage backends, such as local file systems and XNAT. While parts of this functionality have been developed elsewhere, mIQa is unique as it provides a unified, standard interface for efficient QC setup, maintenance, and review for projects analyzing multiple, independently managed data sources.  The usefulness of this unique QC system will be demonstrated on increasing the efficiency of the diverse QC team of the multi-center NCANDA study. Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop multi-site, open-source software for Medical Image Quality Assurance (mIQa) to address the QC needs of geographically diverse teams using small and large medical image-based studies alike. mIQa will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by levering open-source, state-of-the-art machine learning, data management, and web interface technologies. Our effort will minimize the time spent on labor-intensive review and analysis operations by supporting team-oriented reviewing that is guided by highly customizable workflows seamlessly interacting with existing data management systems.",mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment,9622218,R43MH119022,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Alcohols', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Four-dimensional', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'International', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Writing', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'data access', 'data management', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image archival system', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'open source', 'operation', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'research study', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'web interface', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R43,2018,225001,0.007145777294250748
"Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment Supplement Title: Deep learning-based methods for PET image reconstruction and segmentation to enhance radionuclide therapy dosimetry Abstract There is much recent interest in quantitative imaging of yttrium-90 (Y-90) for dosimetry because of the promise of novel Y-90 labelled radionuclide therapies. Deep learning methods are well suited for addressing the challenges of Y-90 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, where compared with diagnostic FDG PET, true coincidence count-rates are very low while random coincidences are high. The potential of deep learning-based algorithms to outperform conventional algorithms in medical imaging is well recognized, however research in applying these methods to nuclear medicine imaging modalities such as PET is very limited. The few studies applying deep learning to PET imaging have been mostly limited to post-reconstruction image processing/analysis for denoising and feature extraction, and not in the image formation/reconstruction process. Additionally, deep learning research in PET thus far have focused on improving diagnostic imaging, not quantitative imaging, which together with accurate lesion/organ segmentation are pre-requisite for accurate dosimetry. In this supplement, we propose to develop and evaluate deep learning-based image reconstruction and lesion/organ segmentation for low count PET applications such as Y-90 PET. Our approach starts with the raw projection data and utilizes a deep recurrent network in the image formation process. Because the two tasks are mutually dependent, our formalism takes the novel approach of joint reconstruction-segmentation with multi-modality (PET/CT) data. Specifically, we will 1) develop and evaluate Y-90 PET image reconstruction with a deep recurrent network for the regularizer, 2) develop and evaluate deep-learning based joint PET segmentation-reconstruction using multi- modal 90Y PET/CT data. To train/validate/test the proposed methods, we will use clinically realistic phantom measurements and simulations as well as leverage on existing patient data from the parent grant where thus far, PET data and radiologist defined morphologic liver/lesion contours for over 50 cases and 150 lesions are available. We will compare the new Y-90 PET reconstruction with the formulation we recently developed under the parent grant (using conventional untrained regularizers) that showed promising results but suffered from resolution- noise tradeoff. The expected outcome of this work is a well validated deep learning reconstruction- segmentation framework for challenging PET imaging applications where conventional methods are suboptimal. The proposed research is expected to result in new and accurate tools for quantitative image reconstruction and lesion/organ segmentation that have the potential to contribute significantly toward improving dosimetry in internal radionuclide therapy such as Yttrium- 90 radioembolization in liver malignancies. This study is relevant to public health because a dosimetry-guided personalized approach to radionuclide therapy is highly likely to substantially improve patient outcomes compared to current standard practice. !",Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment,9750430,R01EB022075,"['90Y', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Formulation', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radioembolization', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'dosimetry', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parent grant', 'personalized approach', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,102093,0.046043005227111466
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. It will pve the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process.",MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning,9414991,R01CA193730,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protons', 'Radiation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'anatomic imaging', 'attenuation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'density', 'electron density', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'primary endpoint', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'reconstruction', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,354198,0.034273605228212566
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9535994,R01EB021396,"['Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'clinical translation', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2018,444363,0.020335446719212155
"Augmented reality visualization for intraoperative guidance based on fluorescence lifetime Project summary/Abstract Optical imaging techniques have demonstrated potential to delineate tumor margins in vivo during surgery as they can rapidly characterize structural, biochemical or functional properties of tissue. Implementation in clinical practice demands rapid visualization and augmentation of imaging data but is often limited by the difficulty in dynamic registration, slow image reconstruction, lack of real- time ability or the need for contrast agents. The goal of this proposal is to implement the recently released Microsoft HoloLens with fiber-based imaging techniques to dynamically augment tissue characteristics directly on the interrogated area in the surgeon’s field of view. The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: (1) To realize a prototype of the augmented reality visualization platform and to combine it with our fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) system, implement a user interface for a convenient interaction with the device. (2) To evaluate and optimize the scanning resolution and the registration precision using fluorescence phantoms and demonstrate the system in vivo for ten patients undergoing lumpectomy surgery. A current pilot study has demonstrated the potential of FLIm to localize tumor margins on excised breast specimen. The acquired in vivo data will help to systematically analyze differences between ex vivo and in vivo fluorescence decay signatures and provide initial data for a large-scale study that will be necessary to delineate tumor margins in vivo. The innovation of this proposal is that it will realize an augmented reality visualization platform for FLIm and other fiber based optical imaging modalities providing dynamic (continuous) augmentation of tissue properties directly on the interrogated area (surgeon’s field of view) in real-time without requiring the injection of contrast agents. The successful completion of this work has consequently the potential for significant impact in the field of surgical navigation. Project narrative This project seeks to realize an augmented and mixed reality visualization based on autofluorescence lifetime and any other fiber-based imaging technique for surgical navigation. The proposed research is consequently relevant to public health as it constitutes a critical part of surgical workflow to enable surgeon finding specific targets, avoiding areas of risk, and providing intraoperative orientation leading to higher resection precision and less interruptions in the surgical workflow.",Augmented reality visualization for intraoperative guidance based on fluorescence lifetime,9585701,R03EB026819,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biochemical', 'Breast', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Excision', 'Fiber', 'Fiber Optics', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Situ', 'Injections', 'Interruption', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modification', 'Near-infrared optical imaging', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'breast lumpectomy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'design and construction', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'optical imaging', 'prototype', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2018,62883,-0.02259587522662757
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9427452,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,400000,0.016270404768033847
"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9476341,R01HL122484,"['3D ultrasound', '4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'perfusion imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,770494,0.04243770633326683
"2018 In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar PROJECT SUMMARY  The field of magnetic resonance (MR) is in the midst of a revolution. Disruptive external forces, such as the advent of powerful new Artificial Intelligence methods, coupled with a recent creative ferment in method development within the field, is changing the way we think about the acquisition, the reconstruction, and the interpretation of MR data. Meanwhile, MR has long been an indispensable tool not only for basic discovery but also for medical diagnostics, but the value proposition of clinical MR imaging is also changing, against the backdrop of a shifting healthcare landscape.  There is a palpable need to explore the full scope of these changes, in a forum that enables deep dives and focused discussion, without losing the necessary breath of perspective. While large meetings such as the annual scientific meeting of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) have the necessary breath, the sheer size and pace of such meetings work against the requisite focus. On the other hand, short focused workshops are better suited to the evaluation of progress in well-defined subfields.  The goal of this grant application is to support a high-impact conference with a time-tested format which is ideally suited to assess recent changes in the field of in vivo MR. The tenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance will be held July 15 to 20, 2018, at Proctor Academy, in Andover, NH. Our GRC will also be associated with the first-ever trainee-organized and trainee-focused Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance, which will take place on the weekend before the GRC (July 14-15, 2018). The trainee seminar meshes well with our goal of preparing young scientists for a changing field and a changing world. We request funding to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows attending these meetings, which will focus explicitly on the shifting role of MR in a rapidly changing world.  The GRC, subtitled “Challenging assumptions about MR technology and applications in a changing world,” will be led by Chair Daniel K. Sodickson, MD, PhD, and Vice Chair Jeff F. Dunn, PhD, and will build upon a rich history of In Vivo MR GRCs. The GRS, subtitled “The Changing World of Magnetic Resonance: Old Physics, New Techniques,” will be led by Chair Scott Beeman, PhD, and Vice Chair Carson Hoffman, BSc, and will further enhance the experience of trainees with tailored opportunities for mentorship, networking, and scientific exchange.  Specific aims of our 2018 GRC and GRS on In Vivo MR are as follows:  1. Explore disruptive forces and marshal disruptive innovation in the field of in vivo MR  2. Foster connections between MR and surrounding disciplines  3. Prepare young scientists to make a difference in a rapidly changing world PROJECT NARRATIVE Support is requested for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the tenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance, scheduled for July 15-20, 2018, and the inaugural trainee- focused Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) to precede the conference on July 14-15, 2018. The GRC will be focused on “Challenging assumptions about MR technology and applications in a changing world,” with the goal of taking the measure of disruptive forces such as Artificial Intelligence, and marshaling disruptive innovations in the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of MR data. The companion GRS will have a related focus on “The changing world of magnetic resonance: old physics, new techniques,” and will provide trainees (who will attend the GRC as well) with opportunities for presentation of their work to peers and thought leaders, discussion of emerging areas of MR, and focused networking and mentorship.",2018 In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar,9608839,R13EB026933,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Anniversary', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Books', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Palpable', 'Physics', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'c new', 'commune', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'meetings', 'method development', 'peer', 'posters', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIBIB,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,5000,0.012049100998514332
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9515521,R01HL115828,"['4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data archive', 'data sharing', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'sex', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,704597,0.0200300196521124
"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,9539728,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary plaque', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,756791,0.03506227529541687
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure, hyper- tension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deﬁcits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantiﬁcation will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and dos- ing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workﬂow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma ﬂow and arterial input function, are difﬁcult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from signiﬁcant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma ﬂow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast ﬂow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma ﬂow (RPF) that lever- age novel ﬂow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated imag- ing methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantiﬁcation is crucial for clinical management of these children. This work will develop accurate and automated pediatric MRI for quantiﬁcation of kidney function and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction.",Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification,9501621,R01EB026136,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac Output', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cone', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Furosemide', 'Gadolinium', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Obstruction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Regimen', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Plasma Flow', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Urinary tract', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Work', 'antimicrobial drug', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney imaging', 'loss of function', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'oncology', 'pressure', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urinary', 'urinary tract obstruction', 'urologic']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,683369,0.0003260339781483899
"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice. There is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour organs at risk in medical images at a high degree of automation for impacting current practice of radiation therapy planning. Encouraged by strong competitive results from the Phase I part of this project, in this grant, further technical advances and a cloud-based software service are proposed. A multicenter clinical evaluation of the new product is also planned to assess the clinical efficacy of the system.",Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning,9622047,R42CA199735,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blinded', 'Body Regions', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Object Attachment', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'software as a service', 'software development', 'software systems', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'virtual']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R42,2018,1057846,0.015127382893758772
"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three‐dimensional (3D) whole‐brain imaging of non‐transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole‐brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo‐bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide‐spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state‐of‐the‐art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large‐scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,9559081,R44MH116827,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2018,556615,-0.004361768601335295
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9524416,R01EB016695,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,598063,0.014227451200487686
"Hamamatsu Nanozoomer S60 Digital Whole Slide Scanner Project Summary/Abstract This application is for a shared instrumentation grant from the Light Microscope Imaging Facility at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) School of Medicine (SOM) to acquire a fully automated, high-capacity, high- resolution Hamamatsu Nanozoomer S60 slide scanner that can accommodate both brightfield and fluorescence imaging in single-slide and double-slide formats. We also request MicroDimensions 3D reconstruction and alignment software packages for manipulating and analyzing the whole slide images produced with the scanner. We need to replace a scanner that is not functioning properly. Our well-established shared core facility supports NIH-funded investigators by giving them access to state-of-the-art microscopy technologies that enhance collaborative, multidisciplinary research. Acquisition of this instrument will have a high impact on the biomedical research at CWRU and expand the scope of our NIH-funded projects. Several projects have been identified that will utilize the scanner and its associated analyses programs. These include: the genetic mechanisms underlying skin fibrosis and cranial bone development (Atit); the mechanisms behind the lifelong functions of transcription factors in axonal growth and architecture (Deneris); deep-learning for histologic image predictors of various diseases (Madabhushi); the development of diagnostic probes to discriminate between glioma subtypes for screening and survival therapies (Brady-Kalnay); the role of progesterone receptors in the control of parturition and the development of therapies to prevent preterm birth (Messiano); the mechanisms by which breast cancer stem cells overcome metastatic latency leading to disease recurrence and the biomarkers that could potentially identify those tumors likely to undergo this process (Schiemann); and the significance of cholesterol-related proteins in brain and retinal function (Pikuleva). Many additional projects of minor users and others at CWRU are anticipated. All of the proposed projects are in need of a high-capacity automated scanner acquiring whole slide images so that analyses can be applied to tissues that cover hundreds of fields of view, rather than the single regions of interest that can be acquired on a standard microscope.

"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9517057,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'success', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2018,169609,0.03016329452967968
"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,9477411,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Endoscopy', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation induced damage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'public health relevance', 'radiation risk', 'radiological imaging', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,245857,-0.01879438011231259
"Quantitative topographic endoscopy for improved screening of non-polypoid colorectal neoplasms Project Summary This project will create and assess new optical imaging and computational technologies with the goal of improving the detection rates of precancerous, non-polypoid lesions during colonoscopy screening. Identifying and removing these subtle lesions is critical to improving the protective value of colonoscopy in reducing mortality from colorectal cancer. However, current approaches to non-polypoid lesion detection are largely unsuccessful because they are time-consuming and require specialized training (chromoendoscopy), or they start with poor image contrast (software analysis of conventional video). This project focuses on developing a novel technique, called quantitative topographic endoscopy (QTE), that optically measures colon surface properties via a modified commercial colonoscope. The key innovation in this proposal is to utilize structured illumination and build on concepts from computer vision and optical engineering to acquire high-resolution 3D images of the colon surface through a custom endoscope. The project will be implemented through three specific aims: (1) develop a miniaturized, quantitative, high-resolution topography system, (2) implement QTE in a modified commercial colonoscope ready for clinical testing, and (3) determine the validity of QTE in a phantom model and its clinical feasibility in a pilot human study. QTE systems developed in this project will be tested in tissue-mimicking phantoms with a goal of achieving better than 1-mm height sensitivity, in ex-vivo resected colon samples with a goal of accurately reconstructing surface shapes from a complex tissue, and in a pilot human study with the goal of obtaining surface topography non-polypoid lesions. Beyond increasing non-polypoid lesion detection rates, QTE has the potential to address other limitations of colonoscopy, including preventing missed polypoid lesions, classifying lesions for resect-and-discard strategies, and improving colonoscopy quality metrics. Additionally, the development of a QTE system that is approved for human studies will serve as a platform for future clinical assessment of other optical techniques such as spatial frequency domain imaging and speckle imaging in a variety of gastroenterology applications. Project Narrative Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Screening colonoscopy can significantly reduce mortality from colorectal cancer but is limited by high miss rates for precancerous non- polypoid lesions. This project will develop new imaging and computational techniques for improving the detection rates of these lesions during colonoscopy screening.",Quantitative topographic endoscopy for improved screening of non-polypoid colorectal neoplasms,9456285,R21EB024700,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopes', 'Colonoscopy', 'Color', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dyes', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Engineering', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Knowledge', 'Large Intestine', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polypectomy', 'Polypoid Lesion', 'Polyps', 'Premalignant', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spatial\xa0Frequency\xa0Domain\xa0Imaging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surface Properties', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'adenoma', 'base', 'chromoscopy', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'computer aided detection', 'contrast imaging', 'human study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'phantom model', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'vector']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,295916,-0.02987201581252897
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,9595406,R01EB009690,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body Image', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,703347,0.023138680989761743
"Fast and Robust Low-Dose X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction Abstract:  The use of CT scans has recently increased, for example, in virtual colonoscopy, CT cardiac screening, screening of the lung in smokers, whole-body CT in asymptomatic patients, and CT imaging of children. Shortening of the scanning time to around 1 second, eliminating the strict need for the subject to remain still or be sedated, is one of the main reasons for the large increase in the pediatric population. CT scans of children have been estimated to produce non-negligible increases in the probability of lifetime cancer mortality, leading to calls for the use of reduced current settings for CT scans of children. For these reasons, the CT industry has put in a lot of effort to develop low-dose CT. One active area of research is methods to reduce the radiation counts by applying adaptive collimation to block unnecessary x-ray photons. Another active area of research is the development of more robust image reconstruction algorithms that are less sensitive to noise for low-count data.  This grant proposal is focused on the second approach — development of fast and robust reconstruction algorithms. It is known that some iterative image reconstruction algorithms outperform the analytical filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm in terms of producing less-noisy images with the same data set. One disadvantage of these iterative algorithms is their long computation time, making them impractical in a real- world CT reconstruction tasks. For this reason, the FBP algorithm is still the main work horse for CT applications.  The main goal of the proposed research is to develop fast and robust iterative-algorithms so that their computation time is at the same order of an analytic FBP algorithm, using experimental low-dose phantom, cadaver data, and low-dose cancer screen chest CT patient data to perform comparison studies. We will answer the question: When the fast and robust algorithms are used, how much can the CT dose be reduced while retaining the image quality of a standard-dose CT produced by the conventional FBP?  This R15 project provides Weber State University (WSU) computer engineering and computer science students with hands-on opportunities and experiences of performing real-world research in the field of healthcare. It will stimulate the interests of students so that they consider a career in biomedical and bioengineering field/industry. Narrative:  CT dose is currently a major concern for the general public. Low-dose CT is under development. The proposed research will focus on developing fast, robust and practical image reconstruction methods that are able to produce a standard CT image using a lower CT dose.",Fast and Robust Low-Dose X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction,9440734,R15EB024283,"['Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cadaver', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collimator', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equus caballus', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Internships', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'parallel computer', 'professor', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'tomography', 'university student']",NIBIB,WEBER STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2018,88321,0.004285924417276906
"System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion Summary BioInVision, Inc. and Case Western Reserve University researchers will develop software for quantitative anal- ysis of cardiac CT perfusion (CCTP), creating an important tool for evaluation of cardiovascular disease. With this product, cardiologists will be able to identify functional flow deficits in coronary artery territories. When one combines functional myocardial blood flow (MBF) with coronary anatomy from computed tomography angi- ography (CTA), it provides needed information on the physiologic significance of a stenosis. The CTA+CCTP combo could provide an ideal gateway exam for deciding whether to send a patient for percutaneous invasive coronary angiography and potential intervention (e.g., stenting). In addition, if flow is low and no stenosis is present, it will suggest microvascular disease, a very prevalent ailment of growing concern, especially among women and in diabetes. CT compares favorably to all other non-invasive cardiovascular imaging techniques (SPECT, PET, and MRI). It is available in many settings, including emergency departments. It provides both MBF and reliable coronary anatomy, not available in any other single modality. It has excellent resolution ena- bling detection of endocardial perfusion deficit, thought to be an early disease indicator that is impossible to assess with SPECT. CT is cheaper and has higher patient throughput than MRI or PET. With inclusion of MBF, CT would have an excellent opportunity to disrupt the diagnostic pathway leading to percutaneous intervention, a pathway now dominated by SPECT myocardial imaging, which includes zero information about coronary anatomy. To achieve reliable, accurate CT MBF measurements, we will invoke innovations to reduce beam hardening and to make reliable estimates of flow. Currently, CT perfusion is done on different CT machines with manufacturers’ proprietary software, using algorithms that can give erroneous MBFs. Applicable to any commercial scanner; our solution would harmonize measurements across acquisition systems providing trust- worthy, standardized measurements to clinicians, thereby improving management of cardiovascular patients. Narrative We will develop software to enable reliable evaluation of blood flow in heart tissue using CT imaging. With suc- cess, our project could lead to an improved gateway examination that could reduce unnecessary invasive cor- onary angiography, thereby reducing costs, patient discomfort, patient risk, and possibly unnecessary interven- tional therapies.",System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion,9622204,R41HL144271,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Attention', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary artery', 'Cost Savings', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inferior', 'Intervention', 'Iodine', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'blood flow measurement', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'perfusion imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,"BIOINVISION, INC.",R41,2018,224240,0.020470417667627146
"New Approach to Quantitative Beta Amyloid Imaging Using PET Summary This project seeks to prove the commercial feasibility of a new approach to analyzing dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data that would improve sensitivity, quantitative accuracy, and accessibility of imaging the biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent progress in understanding the nature of neurodegenerative diseases — especially evidence that the onset of cognitive symptoms of AD can be mitigated —amplify the critical need of improved quantitative evaluation of AD biomarkers. Dynamic PET may be the most accurate modality capable of achieving this goal. However, current strategies of analyzing dynamic PET images either require complex acquisition protocols with invasive arterial blood sampling procedures or rely on accuracy-degrading approximations such as compartment modeling. We have developed Intelligent Dynamics-Driven Quantitative Diagnostics (IDDQD), a novel processing approach based on factor analysis of dynamic structures with partial clustering used to initiate the process. We have shown that an early version of IDDQD can extract blood and tissue tracer dynamics and the corresponding spatial distributions from 11C-PIB PET scans. SolvingDynamics Inc plans to offer a Research-as-a-Service data processing workflow that will apply IDDQD to dynamic brain PET datasets acquired by the customers, producing accurate quantitative tracer dynamics time-activity curves (TACs) and the distribution of the targeted tissues, including the AD biomarkers beta-amyloid and tau. Our proprietary algorithm does not require the tracer dynamics model to achieve steady state, so a shorter scan can be used to generate results of similar or better accuracy than those produced by current approaches, such as reference tissue- based methods. In this proposal, SolvingDynamics seeks to prove the feasibility of our proposed approach by comparing the diagnostics obtained using IDDQD analysis of dynamic PET data and those obtained from independent measurements. A subcontract group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been conducting dynamic 11C-PIB PET studies for several years and has accumulated over 70 cases with PET data matched to both cognitive-memory tests and to post-mortem pathology studies. SolvingDynamics will retrospectively apply its analysis technique to these datasets and compare its computed tissue distributions to standardized uptake volume ratio (SUVR) and distribution volume ratio (DVR) data. A subset of 20 dynamic 11C-PIB PET datasets ranging in length from 15 to 90 minutes will also be analyzed in order to validate the feasibility of reducing the imaging time. In addition, similar studies aimed at reducing imaging time with IDDQD will be performed for 20 PET scans acquired using 18F-AV1451 tracer to image tau. PROJECT NARRATIVE Positron emission tomography image analysis methodology to be validated in this project aims to improve sensitivity and specificity of tissue analysis in dynamic positron emission tomography, improving diagnosis of Alzheimer's diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders.

"Integrating Patient Photographs with Radiography Studies PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) The objective of this proposal is to implement, assess, and enhance a novel technology that can automatically obtain patient photographs at the point-of-care of medical imaging and thus provide a biometric identifier to prevent wrong-patient errors. Wrong-patient errors in radiology, where one patient's medical imaging study is erroneously placed in another patient's record in the picture archiving and communications system (PACS), can cause serious complications for both involved patients. Despite the use of the Joint Commission mandated dual-identifier technique, wrong-patient errors continue to occur. Patient facial photographs obtained at the point-of-care of medical imaging can serve as biometric identifiers that are easily obtained, intrinsic, yet externally visible and non-obtrusively obtained. Prior work by the investigators has demonstrated that such photographs can significantly increase the detection of simulated wrong-patient errors in pre-clinical observer studies. Competing technologies such as fingerprint identifiers, palm vein mapping or retinal scanning, while using intrinsic identifiers, are obtrusive; other technologies that rely on patient armbands with barcodes, while nonobtrusive, only provide extrinsic identifiers that are not unique to the patient. CameRad Technologies, LLC is developing this technology—the PatCamTM system, with two main components, a camera device and an integration server. The integration server accurately matches the photographs with the correct medical imaging studies and then stores them together in the PACS. In this proposal, CameRad will pursue the following aims to de-risk the technology on the path to commercialization. In Aim 1, the investigators will demonstrate that their technology is vendor-neutral and can operate in a highly secure, controlled environment, by implementing the system at the Veterans Affairs Maryland Healthcare System's (VAMHCS) McKesson PACS. They will then assess whether the technology can increase error detection, decrease interpretation time, and be perceived favorably by radiologists in a clinical setting at VAMHCS. In Aim 2, CameRad will develop an automated system face verification system for flagging potentially misidentified imaging studies for review by humans. Achievement of these aims are critical in preparation for a Phase II SBIR project, which will involve a multi-center clinical workflow study to demonstrate that patient photographs can 1) increase detection of wrong patient errors clinically and 2) increase radiologist interpreter efficiency. Most importantly, the potential future impact of this technology is that it can personalize medical imaging studies thereby increasing the focus of interpreting physicians. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Wrong-patient errors in radiology, where one patient's medical images are erroneously placed in another patient's electronic chart, can cause serious problems for both involved patients. CameRad Technologies, LLC will implement and assess a novel technology that automatically and simultaneously obtains a patient's facial photograph along with each medical imaging examination. These photographs, which act as positive patient identifiers, can significantly increase the detection rate of wrong-patient errors and, at the same time, also decrease the interpretation time of imaging studies since they provide some additional clinical clues about patient status.",Integrating Patient Photographs with Radiography Studies,9564757,R43TR002299,"['Achievement', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Environment', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Information Systems', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Maryland', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Shock', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'University Hospitals', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Vendor', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'demographics', 'experience', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'point of care', 'portability', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'residence', 'simulation', 'technology development']",NCATS,"CAMERAD TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2018,224922,-0.01221806499236235
"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET. While the imaging developments are generally applicable to all PET tracers in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, since cancer is the primary clinical application of PET, we will focus our investigation and optimization in this project on three lung cancer imaging tracers at different clinical adoption stages as examples: 1) 18F-FDG as a routine clinical tracer, 2) 18F-FMISO for hypoxia studies as a tracer for human research, and 3) 18F-PD-L1 that specifically binds to human PD-L1 in tumors and other organs as a recent first-in-human tracer. For each tracer, we will investigate 1) static PET, 2) gated and respiratory motion corrected PET, and 3) dynamic PET. Project narrative Patient radiation dose is a major concern in PET imaging.

"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,9547416,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,597688,0.032633908415425725
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease.

"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease.

"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9336855,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,347700,0.0070953223505830785
"New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging Project Summary To more fully exploit the basic science of mechanobiology as it pertains to breast cancer progression, the medical imaging field continues to search for fast, safe, and effective elasticity imaging methods. In this project we propose a fundamentally new approach to ultrasonic elasticity imaging in which the weak forces applied to patient tissues and the measured displacements that result are used to train a numerical model specifically for that patient. This constitutive model is developed using finite-element methods and neural networks assembled in a unique configuration called the AutoProgressive (AutoP) Method. AutoP “learns” complete stress and strain properties directly from sparse force and displacement measurements and without a mathematical model. Using quasi-static stimuli, AutoP exploits the fact that each force-displacement estimate contains information about mechanical properties at all locations in the contiguous tissue. From measurement information and conservation laws, AutoP generates an informational model without the need to make assumptions about tissue linearity, isotropy, or other material properties normally required when constructing images that display tissue mechanical properties. Once an accurate material-property model is formed by AutoP, we adopt a separate rheological model (e.g., Kelvin Voigt) to form viscoelastic parameters for image display. The AutoP method employs beamformed RF-echo acquisitions from which point displacements are estimated, applied compressional force sensed at the transducer surface, and tissue shape.  No other imaging method is capable of estimating all relevant stress fields, which gives AutoP unique capabilities. AutoP estimates the mechanical properties that one strives to obtain from an inverse problem approach, but AutoP is not a mathematical inverse technique and hence does not suffer from nonunique solutions. Without the need to assume material properties, AutoP can (in principle) model tissue properties in three dimensions and in time following large deformations in highly-nonlinear, anisotropic media. This R21 proposal focuses on establishing the feasibility of the AutoP methodology for subsequent clinical trials under future funding. At the completion of this two-year project, we will demonstrate a new tool for medical imaging capable of exploring the mechanical properties of tissues over a very broad range of deformations. We specifically target ultrasonic methods and quasi-static force stimuli in this project. However AutoP could eventually be coupled to other imaging modalities (e.g., MRE, OCE) or dynamic force-stimulus methods.  The scientific premise underlying AutoP is that we already record all of the information needed to generate a very broad range of elasticity images. The key to unlocking this information is to set aside mathematical models in favor of data-driven informational models built using the unique machine learning abilities of the AutoP method. If successful, AutoP will have a major influence on medical elasticity imaging methods. Project Narrative: A new type of machine-learning method is proposed for elasticity imaging of patient tissues that offers the potential to minimize many current limitations. If we are successful in this development, ultrasonic elasticity imaging would significantly improve in its ability to accurately represent mechanical properties of breast tissues, without any changes in current instrumentation and without increasing cost to the healthcare system or adding risk to patients.",New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging,9385425,R21EB023402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Isotropy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modulus', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Writing', 'aged', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cost', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'imaging properties', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical properties', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel strategies', 'object shape', 'processing speed', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'viscoelasticity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2017,220062,-0.00016025558199097152
"Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic cardiomyopathy affects approximately 3 million people in the United States. This form of heart failure is the result of myocardial infarcton or severe coronary heart disease that reduces the viability and function of the heart. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with poor long-term survival when patients with viable myocardium are not revascularized. By imaging myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism and seeking flow-metabolism mismatches, positron emission tomography (PET) method has been established as the gold standard of assessing myocardial viability for selecting patients who can benefit most from surgical revascularization. Current PET method employs two separate static scans with two different radiotracers for generation of the flow-metabolism image pair. While the image of glucose metabolism is acquired using the most widely used radiotracer 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), myocardial blood flow imaging with the radiotracer 13N-ammonia or rubidium-82 suffers from limited clinical availability. In addition, the imaging protoco of two separate imaging sessions is time consuming and resource intensive. As a result, myocardial viability via PET is currently under-utilized in clinic despite its high accuracy and th fast-growing installation of PET/CT scanners in the past decade. In this project, we propose to develop a novel PET method for myocardial viability assessment that only uses a single injection of FDG without the need of a flow- specific radiotracer. We hypothesize that myocardial blood flow can be derived from the quantitative kinetic parameters of dynamic FDG PET. We will develop a new multi-variable prediction model using statistical machine learning to predict myocardial blood flow from dynamic FDG PET data. We will also develop a shortened dynamic FDG PET protocol to improve practicality. This innovation will provide the flow-metabolism image pair for myocardial viability assessment in a clinically favorable time, cost and with reduced radiation dose. Success of this research will make PET assessment of myocardial viability more widely available in clinic with easier access, lower radiation dose, cheaper imaging cost and shorter clinical visit time as compared with conventional two-session protocols, thus improving our clinical practice of treating ischemic cardiomyopathy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a gold standard method for detecting viable myocardium to select which patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy to benefit most from surgical revascularization. Its use in clinic, however, is under-utilized because of the limited clinical availability of the radiotracers needed. This research aims to develop a novel PET imaging method for assessment of myocardial viability that can be easily accessed in clinic with reduced lower radiation dose and imaging cost without compromising imaging performance.",Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET,9251317,R21HL131385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ammonia', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cyclotrons', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Investments', 'Kinetics', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rubidium', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tracer', 'United States', 'Visit', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose transport', 'heart function', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'ischemic cardiomyopathy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'public health relevance', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2017,195625,0.05079820759412826
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9282634,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collimator', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical imaging', 'computer generated', 'cost', 'detector', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'solid state', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,600120,0.021502861753754904
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications.

"Development of An Integrated High Throughput Imaging and Image Analysis Platform for Muscle ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is growing awareness that weakness of muscle is a significant biomedical health issue associated with many different chronic diseases and aging. There are a variety of different diseases that affect muscle, including muscular dystrophy, fibromyalgia, cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis, each of which carries its own unique set of symptoms, accompanied by a myriad of genetic and molecular abnormalities. There is agreement within the basic research and clinical communities that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber cross sectional area, fiber type, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration, and fibrosis are among many critical factors that determine the health and functionality of the muscle. Until now, the imaging equipment available is relatively low throughput and the quantification is still largely based on manual or, at best, semi-automatic methods that require extensive human intervention. In Phase I, CytoInformatics LLC has developed a software called CytoQuant, which can accurately perform automatic segmentation and provide accurate boundaries of each muscle fiber for a cropped image patch. The goal of CytoInformatics LLC in Phase II is to 1) deliver the first version of the CytoQuant software to the market, 2) develop the second version of CytoQuant by continuously improving its performance, especially in handling large scale, whole slide images, and also 3) develop an integrated multiplexing imaging hardware and analysis software framework as a seamless solution for high throughput, automated image analysis of muscle specimens. After careful investigation in Phase I (please refer to the details in business plan), we conclude that this integrated software/hardware platform with cutting-edge technologies in advanced imaging, large scale machine learning, and big data is commercially attractive to the entire muscle community including research institutes, hospitals, and pharmaceutical and athletic companies, demonstrated by strong enthusiasm among end users and many supporting letters. The specific aims are: 1) Deliver the first version of CytoQuant developed in Phase I to the market, continue to develop the second version of CytoQuant, which will focus on improving the robustness and speed in handling whole slide images; 2) Develop an integrated platform that provides unified imaging hardware and image analysis software to handle whole slide images labeled with multiple bio-relevant markers. This unified whole-slide based software and hardware solution will deliver an efficient and specialized imaging platform that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, multi-marker, and automatic image analysis software specifically designed for muscle. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In Phase II, CytoInformatics is proposing a unified whole-slide multispectral imaging (MSI) system that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, accurate, and automated software to provide fast and efficient, multiplexed imaging and quantitative muscle image analysis simultaneously.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9268035,R01HL122484,"['3D ultrasound', '4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'perfusion imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,770494,0.04243770633326683
"Area B:  Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to Measure Tumor Glutamine and Glucose Metabolic Rates in a Single Imaging Session Precision oncology places an increased demand on cancer diagnostics to characterize tumors at the time of diagnosis. Tissue diagnostics for precision oncology increasingly rely on multi-valent assays to characterize cancer biology and identify therapeutic targets. The power of molecular imaging for cancer diagnosis has been well demonstrated by [18F]fluorodexoyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT), widely used in clinical oncology. PET tracers targeted to facets of tumor biology now enable multi-valent molecular imaging to identify therapeutic targets. Early studies show that combined tracer studies, commonly FDG plus a target- specific tracer, are highly predictive of tumor response to targeted therapy. However, emissions from different PET tracers are indistinguishable to a PET scanner, requiring separate imaging sessions on separate days for multiple 18F-based tracers (~ 2 hour half-life) in the same patient. This limits the clinical practicality of multi-tracer PET, and fails to exploit the full power of multi-tracer PET to quantify tumor in vivo biology and biologic heterogeneity for highly variable process such as cancer metabolism. We will overcome this limitation by taking advantage of recent developments in volumetric PET scanners, fast reconstruction, and 4D image analysis methods from our laboratories to develop Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate multi-valent, quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session to guide precision oncology and translational cancer biology research. As such, our proposed technology development project addresses a need, described under Priority Area B for “new capabilities for advancing precise clinical diagnosis of cancer patients”. Using methods developed in our laboratories, we now propose to integrate and enhance these methodologies to develop and validate Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session. We will develop and test this approach for simultaneous glucose and glutamine metabolism imaging, with the goal of guiding metabolism-targeted therapy such as inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The project will focus on the technology developments (largely computational) that enable multi-tracer imaging. Ongoing and separately funded work on clinical studies will acquire data from two separate imaging PET sessions using current technology and will provide data for method development. We will first optimize tracer dose timing, image reconstruction, and image time binning for dual tracer MTV-PET (Aim 1), followed by implementation and technical validation of image analysis using a mixture analysis approach (Aim 2). This will set the stage for technical validation of MTV-PET (Aim 3) and an exploratory aim (Aim 4) testing image analytics based on machine learning. Successful completion of our technology development will yield a new method for multi-tracer PET that would change the landscape for cancer imaging diagnostic biomarker and precision oncology research, consistent with goals of RFA-CA-17-023 Priority Area B. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposed technology development in response to RFA-CA-17-023 (Integration and Validation of Emerging Technologies to Accelerate Cancer Research) addresses a need for more precise diagnosis for precision oncology, under Priority Area B: “New capabilities for advancing precise clinical diagnosis of cancer patients”. We will advantage of recent developments in volumetric positron emission tomography (PET) scanners, fast reconstruction, and 4D image analysis to develop methods for multi-tracer PET with the goal of generating quantitative, multi-parametric whole-body images of specific aspects of cancer biology, including cancer metabolism as the focus of our proposed technology development projects.

"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,9382827,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,771431,0.03506227529541687
"Software for OCT Analysis of Vascular Stents Software for OCT Analysis of Vascular Stents PI: Ronny Shalev, PhD, Dyad Medical Summary Dyad Medical, Inc. will create intravascular OCT (IVOCT) software for clinical, live time determination of stent apposition (OCTivat-live, the live time OCT image visualization and analysis tool) and for offline analysis of stent implantation (OCTivat-stent). Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intra- vascular stents creating an opportunity for both solutions. Although advancements such as drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent design parameters include drug, material (bioresorbable vs metal), polymer composition, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To opti- mize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical evaluations. Intravascular OCT (IVOCT) is the lone imaging modality with the resolution and contrast to meet this challenge. The Core Lab at CWRU is the premiere site in the world for manual analysis of IVOCT image data. A cardiologist analyst takes 6-16 hrs to analyze manually a single stent, and despite training and quality assurance measures, inter- analyst variability can limit the power to determine changes between stent designs. Building upon work at CWRU, we will develop advanced, highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibil- ity, increase accuracy, and harmonize analysis. Software will reduce costs by decreasing manual labor, and with improved reproducibility, possibly enable the use of historical data, eliminating cost of a control arm. Re- garding live time analysis, rather than manually reviewing >500 images in a pullback, with fast software, it will be possible to present the number and location of malapposed struts in 3D, providing instant feedback to phy- sicians on the need for additional dilatation with a larger balloon or higher pressure. In addition, we will auto- matically determine stent and vessel area along the length of the pullback, allowing us to compute stent ex- pansion and eccentricity, quantitative measures related to successful stent deployment, the most important de- terminant of outcome. IVOCT could also play a role at patient follow up. If a stent is well covered, then long- term anti-platelet therapy might be unnecessary, minimizing bleeding risk. If a stent has many uncovered struts, a therapeutic might prevent stent thrombosis or stimulate healing. Project Narrative: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year. Our methods will enable optimization of stent technologies and improved deployment for improved treatment of vascular dis- ease.",Software for OCT Analysis of Vascular Stents,9407267,R43HL137500,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dilatation - action', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Feedback', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stents', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'arm', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cost', 'design', 'follow-up', 'healing', 'image visualization', 'imaging modality', 'implantation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'personalized diagnostics', 'preclinical evaluation', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'research clinical testing', 'restenosis', 'statistics', 'stent thrombosis', 'tool', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,"DYAD MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2017,224744,0.00412033291270272
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9300962,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2017,169609,0.03016329452967968
"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,9246984,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Endoscopy', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation induced damage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'public health relevance', 'radiation risk', 'radiological imaging', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,60564,-0.01879438011231259
"Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease by imaging the left ventricle (LV) of the heart at rest and then after either exercise or pharmacologically-induce stress to reveal ischemia. However, acquisitions are heavily operator dependent, two-dimensional (2D), and interpretation is generally based on qualitative assessment. While a variety of quantitative 2D approaches have been proposed in the research literature, none have been shown to be superior to the still highly variable qualitative visual comparison of rest/stress echocardiographic image sequences for detecting ischemic disease. Here, we propose that the way forward must focus on a new computational image analysis paradigm for quantitative 4D (three spatial dimensions plus time) stress echocardiography. Our strategy integrates information derived from both radiofrequency (RF) and B-mode echocardiographic images acquired using a matrix array probe. The integrated analysis system will yield accurate and robust measures of strain and strain rate - at rest, stress and differentially between rest and stress - that will identify myocardial tissue at-risk after dobutamine-induced stress. This work wil involve the development of novel (1) phase-sensitive, correlation-based RF ultrasound speckle tracking to estimate mid-wall displacements, (2) ma- chine learning techniques to localize the LV bounding surfaces and their displacements from B-mode data, (3) a meshless integration approach based on radial basis functions (RBFs) and Bayesian reasoning/sparse coding to estimate dense spatiotemporal parameters of strain and strain rate and (4) non-rigid registration of rest and stress image sequences to develop unique, 3D differential deformation parameters. The quantitative approach will be validated with implanted sonomicrometers and microsphere-derived flows using an acute canine model of stenosis. The ability of deformation and differential deformation derived from 4D stress echocardiography to detect new myocardial tissue at-risk in the presence of existing infarction will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic canine model of infarction with superimposed ischemia. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility of our deformation and differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Three main collaborators will team on this work. A group led by Matthew O'Donnell from the University of Washington will develop the RF-based speckle tracking methods. An image analysis group led by the PI James Duncan at Yale University will develop methods for segmentation, shape tracking, dense displacement integration and strain computation. A cardiology/physiology group under Dr. Albert Sinusas at Yale will perform the acute and chronic canine studies and the human stress echo studies. A consultant from Philips Medical Systems will work with the entire team to bridge the ultrasound image acquisition technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease are commonly performed using stress echocardiography, a test that is performed 3 million times in the United States annually. Our new methods will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation in 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) due to stress using a cost efficient and noninvasive imaging technology. The resulting methodology may lead to more sensitive and accurate detection of stress-induced ischemia that will better guide clinical decision making.",Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography,9212187,R01HL121226,"['Acute', 'Anatomy', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomechanics', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiology', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diastole', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dobutamine', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Radial', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'elastography', 'in vivo', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'perfusion imaging', 'public health relevance', 'radio frequency', 'radiofrequency', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,768639,0.013641166214491558
"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,9350173,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,597688,0.032633908415425725
"Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microscope techniques to image inside brain tissue are generally limited by poor depth penetration. Micro-endoscopy, wherein a probe is physically inserted into the tissue, can overcome this limitation in depth penetration, but at the expense of invasiveness and tissue damage due to the size of the probe. Our goal here is to palliate these problems by developing an ultra-miniature microendoscope probe based on a single, lensless optical fiber.  The direct transmission of an image through an optical ﬁber is diﬃcult because spatial information becomes scrambled upon propagation. We have recently demonstrated an image transmission strategy where spatial information is ﬁrst converted to spectral information. Our strategy is based on a principle of spread-spectrum encoding, borrowed from wireless communications, wherein object pixels are converted into distinct spectral codes that span the full bandwidth of the object spectrum. Image recovery is performed by numerical inversion of the detected spectrum at the ﬁber output. We have provided a simple demonstration of spread-spectrum encoding using macroscopic Fabry-Perot etalons. Our technique enables the 2D imaging of luminous (i.e. fluorescent or bioluminescent) objects with high throughput independent of pixel number. Moreover, it is insensitive to ﬁber bending, contains no moving parts, and opens the attractive possibility of extreme miniaturization down to the size of a single optical fiber.  Our goal here is to develop, characterize, and establish the versatility of a new class of ultra-miniature fiber probes that can provide functional 2D brain imaging at arbitrary depths and with minimal tissue damage. Our strategy will involve probe development, machine-learning algorithm development, and the actual demonstration of microendoscopic imaging in freely moving behaving animals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently demonstrated a strategy to image through a single, lensless optical fiber.

"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians.  Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9186673,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,347254,0.0070953223505830785
"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,9119020,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Polynomial Models', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2016,222652,0.048422136034468474
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9064178,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,695446,0.021502861753754904
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale.

"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. It will pve the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process.            ",MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning,9026075,R01CA193730,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protons', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'attenuation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'density', 'electron density', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'reconstruction', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,362066,0.034273605228212566
"Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic cardiomyopathy affects approximately 3 million people in the United States. This form of heart failure is the result of myocardial infarcton or severe coronary heart disease that reduces the viability and function of the heart. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with poor long-term survival when patients with viable myocardium are not revascularized. By imaging myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism and seeking flow-metabolism mismatches, positron emission tomography (PET) method has been established as the gold standard of assessing myocardial viability for selecting patients who can benefit most from surgical revascularization. Current PET method employs two separate static scans with two different radiotracers for generation of the flow-metabolism image pair. While the image of glucose metabolism is acquired using the most widely used radiotracer 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), myocardial blood flow imaging with the radiotracer 13N-ammonia or rubidium-82 suffers from limited clinical availability. In addition, the imaging protoco of two separate imaging sessions is time consuming and resource intensive. As a result, myocardial viability via PET is currently under-utilized in clinic despite its high accuracy and th fast-growing installation of PET/CT scanners in the past decade. In this project, we propose to develop a novel PET method for myocardial viability assessment that only uses a single injection of FDG without the need of a flow- specific radiotracer. We hypothesize that myocardial blood flow can be derived from the quantitative kinetic parameters of dynamic FDG PET. We will develop a new multi-variable prediction model using statistical machine learning to predict myocardial blood flow from dynamic FDG PET data. We will also develop a shortened dynamic FDG PET protocol to improve practicality. This innovation will provide the flow-metabolism image pair for myocardial viability assessment in a clinically favorable time, cost and with reduced radiation dose. Success of this research will make PET assessment of myocardial viability more widely available in clinic with easier access, lower radiation dose, cheaper imaging cost and shorter clinical visit time as compared with conventional two-session protocols, thus improving our clinical practice of treating ischemic cardiomyopathy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a gold standard method for detecting viable myocardium to select which patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy to benefit most from surgical revascularization. Its use in clinic, however, is under-utilized because of the limited clinical availability of the radiotracers needed. This research aims to develop a novel PET imaging method for assessment of myocardial viability that can be easily accessed in clinic with reduced lower radiation dose and imaging cost without compromising imaging performance.              ",Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET,9020059,R21HL131385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ammonia', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cyclotrons', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Investments', 'Kinetics', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rubidium', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'United States', 'Visit', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose transport', 'heart function', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'ischemic cardiomyopathy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2016,234875,0.05079820759412826
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9176982,R01EB021396,"['Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2016,677628,0.020335446719212155
"Development of An Integrated High Throughput Imaging and Image Analysis Platform for Muscle ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is growing awareness that weakness of muscle is a significant biomedical health issue associated with many different chronic diseases and aging. There are a variety of different diseases that affect muscle, including muscular dystrophy, fibromyalgia, cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis, each of which carries its own unique set of symptoms, accompanied by a myriad of genetic and molecular abnormalities. There is agreement within the basic research and clinical communities that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber cross sectional area, fiber type, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration, and fibrosis are among many critical factors that determine the health and functionality of the muscle. Until now, the imaging equipment available is relatively low throughput and the quantification is still largely based on manual or, at best, semi-automatic methods that require extensive human intervention. In Phase I, CytoInformatics LLC has developed a software called CytoQuant, which can accurately perform automatic segmentation and provide accurate boundaries of each muscle fiber for a cropped image patch. The goal of CytoInformatics LLC in Phase II is to 1) deliver the first version of the CytoQuant software to the market, 2) develop the second version of CytoQuant by continuously improving its performance, especially in handling large scale, whole slide images, and also 3) develop an integrated multiplexing imaging hardware and analysis software framework as a seamless solution for high throughput, automated image analysis of muscle specimens. After careful investigation in Phase I (please refer to the details in business plan), we conclude that this integrated software/hardware platform with cutting-edge technologies in advanced imaging, large scale machine learning, and big data is commercially attractive to the entire muscle community including research institutes, hospitals, and pharmaceutical and athletic companies, demonstrated by strong enthusiasm among end users and many supporting letters. The specific aims are: 1) Deliver the first version of CytoQuant developed in Phase I to the market, continue to develop the second version of CytoQuant, which will focus on improving the robustness and speed in handling whole slide images; 2) Develop an integrated platform that provides unified imaging hardware and image analysis software to handle whole slide images labeled with multiple bio-relevant markers. This unified whole-slide based software and hardware solution will deliver an efficient and specialized imaging platform that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, multi-marker, and automatic image analysis software specifically designed for muscle.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In Phase II, CytoInformatics is proposing a unified whole-slide multispectral imaging (MSI) system that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, accurate, and automated software to provide fast and efficient, multiplexed imaging and quantitative muscle image analysis simultaneously.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9061011,R01HL122484,"['4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'predictive modeling', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2016,770494,0.04243770633326683
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9132242,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2016,169609,0.03016329452967968
"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,9056996,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Endoscopy', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,306421,-0.01879438011231259
"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of statistical frameworks and methods for the analysis of complex ultra-high-dimensional biomedical imaging.

"Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease by imaging the left ventricle (LV) of the heart at rest and then after either exercise or pharmacologically-induce stress to reveal ischemia. However, acquisitions are heavily operator dependent, two-dimensional (2D), and interpretation is generally based on qualitative assessment. While a variety of quantitative 2D approaches have been proposed in the research literature, none have been shown to be superior to the still highly variable qualitative visual comparison of rest/stress echocardiographic image sequences for detecting ischemic disease. Here, we propose that the way forward must focus on a new computational image analysis paradigm for quantitative 4D (three spatial dimensions plus time) stress echocardiography. Our strategy integrates information derived from both radiofrequency (RF) and B-mode echocardiographic images acquired using a matrix array probe. The integrated analysis system will yield accurate and robust measures of strain and strain rate - at rest, stress and differentially between rest and stress - that will identify myocardial tissue at-risk after dobutamine-induced stress. This work wil involve the development of novel (1) phase-sensitive, correlation-based RF ultrasound speckle tracking to estimate mid-wall displacements, (2) ma- chine learning techniques to localize the LV bounding surfaces and their displacements from B-mode data, (3) a meshless integration approach based on radial basis functions (RBFs) and Bayesian reasoning/sparse coding to estimate dense spatiotemporal parameters of strain and strain rate and (4) non-rigid registration of rest and stress image sequences to develop unique, 3D differential deformation parameters. The quantitative approach will be validated with implanted sonomicrometers and microsphere-derived flows using an acute canine model of stenosis. The ability of deformation and differential deformation derived from 4D stress echocardiography to detect new myocardial tissue at-risk in the presence of existing infarction will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic canine model of infarction with superimposed ischemia. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility of our deformation and differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Three main collaborators will team on this work. A group led by Matthew O'Donnell from the University of Washington will develop the RF-based speckle tracking methods. An image analysis group led by the PI James Duncan at Yale University will develop methods for segmentation, shape tracking, dense displacement integration and strain computation. A cardiology/physiology group under Dr. Albert Sinusas at Yale will perform the acute and chronic canine studies and the human stress echo studies. A consultant from Philips Medical Systems will work with the entire team to bridge the ultrasound image acquisition technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease are commonly performed using stress echocardiography, a test that is performed 3 million times in the United States annually. Our new methods will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation in 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) due to stress using a cost efficient and noninvasive imaging technology. The resulting methodology may lead to more sensitive and accurate detection of stress-induced ischemia that will better guide clinical decision making.",Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography,9002898,R01HL121226,"['Acute', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiology', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diastole', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dobutamine', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'elastography', 'in vivo', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'radio frequency', 'radiofrequency', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,776460,0.013641166214491558
"Analyzing Large-Scale Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease Analyzing Large-Scale Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract: Advances in imaging technology offer great opportunities to study Alzheimer's disease (AD) in many ways that are not previously possible. This leads to various large-scale imaging studies, i.e., ADNI, for discovering AD-related imaging biomarkers. In these imaging studies, image registration plays a key role in reducing the confounding inter-subject variability and also enhancing the statistical power of identifying abnormalities related to AD. However, automated processing of large-scale imaging data, i.e., involving anything from hundreds to thousands of 3D brain images, is not trivial and requires dedicated computational tools. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel deep multi-layer groupwise registration methods for effective, efficient and simultaneous registration of all brain images with possibly large anatomical and appearance differences. Also, to accommodate for new images acquired from the on-going large-scale imaging study, an efficient incremental groupwise registration method will be further developed to avoid time- and resource-consuming re-registration of all new and existing images from scratch. Our key idea is to break down the complex groupwise registration problem into hierarchical sets of small- scale registration tasks that can be solved easily, thus making the large-scale registration more manageable and fast. Specifically, 1) for fast initialization of large-scale groupwise registration of brain images, we will develop in Aim 1 a hierarchical learning-based landmark detection algorithm, based on random forest regression, to detect salient anatomical landmarks and then jointly align all images with detected landmarks. Since all images are distributed in a complex manifold and also the registration of similar images is much faster and more accurate, we propose to first build a graph to link each image only with similar images, and then formulate groupwise registration as dynamic graph shrinkage. This avoids direct registration of each image to the group-mean image as done in the conventional methods, thus improving both speed and accuracy. 2) To significantly speed up and also improve this single-layer graph-based groupwise registration, we will further develop in Aim 2 a deep multi-layer groupwise registration by simultaneous layer-by-layer graph construction and layer-wise registration. 3) Finally, to significantly increase both the speed and accuracy of registration for new images acquired from on-going large-scale imaging study, we will develop in Aim 3 a novel incremental groupwise registration method to reuse previous registration results of existing images for guiding registration of new images. Specifically, each new image can be quickly registered to the common space of existing images by finding its most similar existing image(s). Accordingly, all new and existing images will become similar in the common space and then can be quickly updated for their overall groupwise registration. All computational tools developed will be made freely available to the research community, for accelerating the imaging study of Alzheimer's disease. Narrative Description of Project Modern imaging techniques offer great opportunities to study Alzheimer's disease (AD) in many ways that are not previously possible. This leads to increasing number of large-scale imaging studies, including ADNI. However, the overwhelmingly big data poses new challenges to researchers in automated data processing. Thus, modern computational tools are expected to be able to handle the vast amount of data within a manageable time frame. In light of this, we aim to solve this large-scale spatial registration problem – a critical step directly related to accuracy and precision of imaging biomarkers to be discovered for AD. In particular, we will develop novel deep multi-layer groupwise registration methods for effective, efficient and simultaneous registration of all brain images with possibly large anatomical and appearance differences. Also, to accommodate for new images acquired from the on-going study, an efficient incremental groupwise registration will be further developed to avoid time- and resource-consuming re-registration of all new and existing images from scratch. The development of these advanced computational tools will eventually benefit for discovery of new imaging biomarkers for AD.",Analyzing Large-Scale Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease,9240850,RF1AG053867,"['Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appearance', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mainstreaming', 'Methods', 'Play', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'empowered', 'forest', 'image guided', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'rapid technique']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,RF1,2016,2485857,-0.036951773127260557
"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,9119513,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,597688,0.032633908415425725
"Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microscope techniques to image inside brain tissue are generally limited by poor depth penetration. Micro-endoscopy, wherein a probe is physically inserted into the tissue, can overcome this limitation in depth penetration, but at the expense of invasiveness and tissue damage due to the size of the probe. Our goal here is to palliate these problems by developing an ultra-miniature microendoscope probe based on a single, lensless optical fiber.  The direct transmission of an image through an optical ﬁber is diﬃcult because spatial information becomes scrambled upon propagation. We have recently demonstrated an image transmission strategy where spatial information is ﬁrst converted to spectral information. Our strategy is based on a principle of spread-spectrum encoding, borrowed from wireless communications, wherein object pixels are converted into distinct spectral codes that span the full bandwidth of the object spectrum. Image recovery is performed by numerical inversion of the detected spectrum at the ﬁber output. We have provided a simple demonstration of spread-spectrum encoding using macroscopic Fabry-Perot etalons. Our technique enables the 2D imaging of luminous (i.e. fluorescent or bioluminescent) objects with high throughput independent of pixel number. Moreover, it is insensitive to ﬁber bending, contains no moving parts, and opens the attractive possibility of extreme miniaturization down to the size of a single optical fiber.  Our goal here is to develop, characterize, and establish the versatility of a new class of ultra-miniature fiber probes that can provide functional 2D brain imaging at arbitrary depths and with minimal tissue damage. Our strategy will involve probe development, machine-learning algorithm development, and the actual demonstration of microendoscopic imaging in freely moving behaving animals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently demonstrated a strategy to image through a single, lensless optical fiber.

"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.            ",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,8953102,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2015,180330,0.048422136034468474
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale.

"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8906912,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,685014,0.021502861753754904
"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,8842707,R01HL122484,"['4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'predictive modeling', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,758935,0.04243770633326683
"Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral venous access is pivotal to a wide range of clinical interventions and is consequently the leading cause of medical injury in the U.S. Complications associated with the procedure are exacerbated in difficult settings, where the rate of success depends heavily on the patient's physiology and the practitioner's experience. My dissertation thesis pertains to the development of imaging and robotic technologies to improve the accuracy and speed of blood draws and IV's. The core technology is an image-guided robotic device that accurately and autonomously introduces a cannula for venous access. The device operates by mapping in real-time the 3D structure of peripheral veins in order to robotically direct a needle into a selected vein. A working prototype has been developed and validated in several studies, the results of which are described in two journal publications. The device combines a 3D near-infrared vein imager, a robot, and computer vision software; these three components form the basis of the three Specific Aims described in this proposal. The Aims fit into the overall dissertation by 1) incorporating the current imaging hardware into a standalone, handheld imaging device; 2) introducing software for the imaging device that assists in selecting suitable cannulation sites; and 3) integrating the imaging device and software with a miniaturized version of the current robot. The outcome of this work will be a compact and low-cost system that is suited for beta-stage development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood draws and IV therapies are one of the most commonly performed medical routines in hospitals and clinics. Injuries to doctors and patients happen frequently because of how difficult it can be to find veins and accurately insert the needle. We are developing a portable and lightweight medical robot to perform the procedure in situations where the doctor is unable to successfully access the veins. This device may greatly improve the safety and accuracy of venous access, and has wide applications in many clinical areas.","Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea",8832591,F31EB018191,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood', 'Cannulas', 'Cannulations', 'Catheters', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Emergency Care', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Motivation', 'Needles', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Sprague-Dawley Rats', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'image guided', 'imaging software', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'meetings', 'miniaturize', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'robotic device', 'skeletal', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",F31,2015,32250,-0.01705644705693375
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.                ",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,8968015,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2015,169609,0.03016329452967968
"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.            ",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,8843721,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Endoscopy', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,306421,-0.01879438011231259
"Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A patient's five-year survival rate depend on the tumor stage at the time of diagnosis, and stage of the tumor plays a substantial role in decision-making regarding treatment. Thus, precise pre-treatment diagnostic evaluation and staging of colorectal cancer are important. In addition, angiogenesis plays an important role in the process of growth and metastasis in CRC and is reported as a useful prognostic marker, similar to many other carcinomas. Thus, in vivo quantification of the tumor angiogenesis rate holds promise in improving the management of CRC. Perfusion computed tomography (PCT) acquires high temporal resolution images, thus enabling evaluation of hemodynamic changes of tissue in vivo by modeling tracer kinetics. PCT has been reported to characterize tumor angiogenesis, and to be a more sensitive imaging biomarker for predicting of overall survival (OS) of CRC patients than conventional tumor staging. In clinical practice, however, the PCT protocol is a trade-off between high-temporal resolution and the total radiation dose required. Thus, the use of dynamic CT imaging derived from four temporal phases, which include pre-contrast, arterial, portal, and delayed phases, is highly desirable, because it is more readily available and yields substantially lower radiation exposure to the patients than that of PCT. However, low temporal resolution in four-phase dynamic CT presents several barriers in modeling tracer kinetics, primarily because of the lack of temporal enhancement information, which limits the ability to obtain reliable physiological information. We will thus develop a novel continuous-time modeling of tracer kinetics without any discretization of the enhancement curves. Such an approach will enable estimation of the time lag between onset time points of input and response enhancements as well as other kinetic parameters in four-phase dynamic CT. We hypothesize that the proposed tracer kinetic model can be an effective imaging biomarker for the risk stratification of recurrence of CRC and for prediction of OS. To explore these hypotheses, the specific aims of the proposed project are (1) Develop a novel single-input continuous-time tracer kinetic model without any discretization to fit temporal enhancement curves in four-phase dynamic CT of the colon, and (2) develop kinetic-model-based imaging biomarkers from four-phase dynamic CT and evaluate their performance in predicting clinical outcome in CRC patients. Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. Using such a biomarker to optimize therapy will provide patients with more effective treatment, thus reducing side effects associated with unnecessary therapeutic regimens. In addition, use of this biomarker may result in cost savings in treatment by reducing frequency of follow-up examinations in patients with a low risk of recurrence.",Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC,8893927,R21CA187877,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cost Savings', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier Transform', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stratification', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor stage', 'United States', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal aorta', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'colon cancer patients', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'response', 'temporal measurement']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2015,189225,-0.035084092553604125
"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of statistical frameworks and methods for the analysis of complex ultra-high-dimensional biomedical imaging.

"Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease by imaging the left ventricle (LV) of the heart at rest and then after either exercise or pharmacologically-induce stress to reveal ischemia. However, acquisitions are heavily operator dependent, two-dimensional (2D), and interpretation is generally based on qualitative assessment. While a variety of quantitative 2D approaches have been proposed in the research literature, none have been shown to be superior to the still highly variable qualitative visual comparison of rest/stress echocardiographic image sequences for detecting ischemic disease. Here, we propose that the way forward must focus on a new computational image analysis paradigm for quantitative 4D (three spatial dimensions plus time) stress echocardiography. Our strategy integrates information derived from both radiofrequency (RF) and B-mode echocardiographic images acquired using a matrix array probe. The integrated analysis system will yield accurate and robust measures of strain and strain rate - at rest, stress and differentially between rest and stress - that will identify myocardial tissue at-risk after dobutamine-induced stress. This work wil involve the development of novel (1) phase-sensitive, correlation-based RF ultrasound speckle tracking to estimate mid-wall displacements, (2) ma- chine learning techniques to localize the LV bounding surfaces and their displacements from B-mode data, (3) a meshless integration approach based on radial basis functions (RBFs) and Bayesian reasoning/sparse coding to estimate dense spatiotemporal parameters of strain and strain rate and (4) non-rigid registration of rest and stress image sequences to develop unique, 3D differential deformation parameters. The quantitative approach will be validated with implanted sonomicrometers and microsphere-derived flows using an acute canine model of stenosis. The ability of deformation and differential deformation derived from 4D stress echocardiography to detect new myocardial tissue at-risk in the presence of existing infarction will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic canine model of infarction with superimposed ischemia. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility of our deformation and differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Three main collaborators will team on this work. A group led by Matthew O'Donnell from the University of Washington will develop the RF-based speckle tracking methods. An image analysis group led by the PI James Duncan at Yale University will develop methods for segmentation, shape tracking, dense displacement integration and strain computation. A cardiology/physiology group under Dr. Albert Sinusas at Yale will perform the acute and chronic canine studies and the human stress echo studies. A consultant from Philips Medical Systems will work with the entire team to bridge the ultrasound image acquisition technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease are commonly performed using stress echocardiography, a test that is performed 3 million times in the United States annually. Our new methods will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation in 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) due to stress using a cost efficient and noninvasive imaging technology. The resulting methodology may lead to more sensitive and accurate detection of stress-induced ischemia that will better guide clinical decision making.",Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography,8807942,R01HL121226,"['Acute', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiology', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diastole', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dobutamine', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'elastography', 'in vivo', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'radio frequency', 'radiofrequency', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,767996,0.013641166214491558
"Quantitative Image Analysis Techniques for Optic Nerve Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disorders of the optic nerve (ON) account for a significant percentage of the 20 most impactful ophthalmological conditions. Collectively, diseases of the ON are the number one cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and present serious public health concerns in the U.S. Consider, for example, that glaucoma impacts more than three million Americans and costs the U.S. economy almost $3 billion per year. Optic neuritis (i.e., inflammatory demyelination of the ON) is the initial symptom in ~25% of all multipl sclerosis (MS) cases (which impacts over 400 thousand Americans and introduces societal health care costs of nearly $30 billion per year). Nearly two thirds of MS patients will experience episodes of optic neuritis in their lifetimes, and 40-60% of patients have visual defects localized to the ON. These disorders irreversibly damage the ON. Even so, damage to axons in the ON is progressive, defined by a window of opportunity for treatment between loss of function and actual degeneration. The potential for recovery exists because there are treatments that can help prevent progression if administered during this window of opportunity. Yet, we do not have effective means to assess who is in the window and who will benefit from treatment. We propose to translate computational imaging methods from the neuroimaging community to provide robust, quantitative tools for assessing the optic nerve (ON) on clinical and research imaging sequences. These efforts will improve prognostic accuracy, lead to better understanding of patient responses, and enhance targeted interventions. The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse ON data from modern MRI and CT clinical sequences. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative ON phenotypes on longitudinal clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who respond to treatment versus those who do not.  The overall goal of this research is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the ON and its relationships with pathological disorders. We will build upon recent advances in robust medical image computing to segment the ON in clinical CT and MRI acquisitions, develop registration procedures to establish intra- and inter-subject correspondence, and bring together information from the multi-modal battery of imaging studies that are typically used in clinical care (aim 1). With these new methods, we will address the exploratory hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging data can increase prognostic accuracy (aim 2). We note that aim 2 is particularly exploratory and in line with the high- risk/high-reward aspect of this mechanism; many studies have shown that baseline imaging does not conclusively predict long term outcome or treatment response. We hypothesize that this may be because early findings are related to edema and inflammation rather than cellular damage per se. Once this exploratory phase is complete, we will pursue promising prognostic biomarkers using more detailed condition staging criteria and including more than two longitudinal time points in the analysis. Ultimately, these efforts will improve assessment ON disease and, in turn, patient care.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes.

"ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major problem addressed in this proposal is the development and evaluation of an automated noninvasive approach to discriminate different normal and pathological tissue types using machine learning algorithms; previous applications of machine learning have been based on features of the backscattered ultrasound that are essentially energy based. Our approach will be based on extracting features from images whose pixels are determined by the entropy contained in segments of the backscattered ultrasound. The unique attributes of entropy imaging suggest that the automated analysis we propose would be particularly robust for discrimination of deep tissues in a clinical environment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All skilled clinical practitioners and interpreters of ultrasound studies realize that much information exists in recorded US images that is processed immediately by the visual cortex and is useful for qualitatively defining pathology, yet defies ready quantification by any robust algorithm. Traditional energy-based representations display grayscale intensities and speckle patterns that have been mapped parametrically into various tissue classification schemes that have yet to demonstrate organ or tissue specificity, although progress has been reported in distinguishing pathologies over the last 30 years. However, the fact that US signal processing and representation of backscatter data in terms of energy functions has not changed over the last 50 years suggests that alternative signal processing schemes may be indicated to represent the richness of the information contained within the backscattered data. To meet this challenge, we have been involved over the past 10 years in processing backscattered RF to create ""information"" images and in designing ""information sensitive"" approaches to classifying the data sets based on statistical analysis of these images These novel and user independent metrics utilize the entropy of windowed segments of radiofrequency (RF) backscatter signal from tis- sue, which represents a radical departure from grayscale or speckle metrics. In this approach the entropy of the backscattered segment is used to produce a pixel value in the tissue image. This processing strategy has proven to be sensitive to weak, sub-resolution sized changes in tissue.

"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,8916335,R00LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Simulate', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'memory process', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R00,2014,246867,0.005656728600881183
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.            ",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8762268,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2014,653934,0.021502861753754904
"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.            ",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,8674683,R01HL122484,"['4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2014,782871,0.04243770633326683
"Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral venous access is pivotal to a wide range of clinical interventions and is consequently the leading cause of medical injury in the U.S. Complications associated with the procedure are exacerbated in difficult settings, where the rate of success depends heavily on the patient's physiology and the practitioner's experience. My dissertation thesis pertains to the development of imaging and robotic technologies to improve the accuracy and speed of blood draws and IV's. The core technology is an image-guided robotic device that accurately and autonomously introduces a cannula for venous access. The device operates by mapping in real-time the 3D structure of peripheral veins in order to robotically direct a needle into a selected vein. A working prototype has been developed and validated in several studies, the results of which are described in two journal publications. The device combines a 3D near-infrared vein imager, a robot, and computer vision software; these three components form the basis of the three Specific Aims described in this proposal. The Aims fit into the overall dissertation by 1) incorporating the current imaging hardware into a standalone, handheld imaging device; 2) introducing software for the imaging device that assists in selecting suitable cannulation sites; and 3) integrating the imaging device and software with a miniaturized version of the current robot. The outcome of this work will be a compact and low-cost system that is suited for beta-stage development.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood draws and IV therapies are one of the most commonly performed medical routines in hospitals and clinics. Injuries to doctors and patients happen frequently because of how difficult it can be to find veins and accurately insert the needle. We are developing a portable and lightweight medical robot to perform the procedure in situations where the doctor is unable to successfully access the veins. This device may greatly improve the safety and accuracy of venous access, and has wide applications in many clinical areas.            ","Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea",8718641,F31EB018191,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood', 'Cannulas', 'Cannulations', 'Catheters', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Emergency Care', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Motivation', 'Needles', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Sprague-Dawley Rats', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'meetings', 'miniaturize', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'robotic device', 'skeletal', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",F31,2014,34424,-0.01705644705693375
"In-field FAST Procedure Support and Automation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound examination performed to identify intra-peritoneal hemorrhage or pericardial tamponade. FAST involves the detection of free fluid in ultrasound images from four specific abdominal areas. Unstable patients with positive FAST results are operated on, and stable patients with negative results tend to be observed.  We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life-saving FAST procedures. The proposed system will consist of a low-cost ultrasound probe, connected to a ruggedize tablet computer, running innovative computer vision algorithms, embedded in an intuitive application. Using that system, a novice operator will be visually guided to acquire ultrasound images from the abdominal locations and quantify the free fluid in those images.  The target for our initial deployment of the system is level 3 and 4 trauma centers. These centers must often serve areas spanning hundreds and even thousands of miles; however, they are typically under-staffed and under-equipped.  The proposal is being clinically driven by Jeffrey Lowell, MD. He is a USNR Trauma Surgeon, and he was recently deployed to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the only Level I Trauma Center outside the U.S.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound-based examination for rapidly detecting blood in the abdomen, particularly after blunt abdominal trauma, which is common, for example, with car accidents.

"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.            ",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,8633431,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Endoscopy', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2014,297228,-0.01879438011231259
"Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A patient's five-year survival rate depend on the tumor stage at the time of diagnosis, and stage of the tumor plays a substantial role in decision-making regarding treatment. Thus, precise pre-treatment diagnostic evaluation and staging of colorectal cancer are important. In addition, angiogenesis plays an important role in the process of growth and metastasis in CRC and is reported as a useful prognostic marker, similar to many other carcinomas. Thus, in vivo quantification of the tumor angiogenesis rate holds promise in improving the management of CRC. Perfusion computed tomography (PCT) acquires high temporal resolution images, thus enabling evaluation of hemodynamic changes of tissue in vivo by modeling tracer kinetics. PCT has been reported to characterize tumor angiogenesis, and to be a more sensitive imaging biomarker for predicting of overall survival (OS) of CRC patients than conventional tumor staging. In clinical practice, however, the PCT protocol is a trade-off between high-temporal resolution and the total radiation dose required. Thus, the use of dynamic CT imaging derived from four temporal phases, which include pre-contrast, arterial, portal, and delayed phases, is highly desirable, because it is more readily available and yields substantially lower radiation exposure to the patients than that of PCT. However, low temporal resolution in four-phase dynamic CT presents several barriers in modeling tracer kinetics, primarily because of the lack of temporal enhancement information, which limits the ability to obtain reliable physiological information. We will thus develop a novel continuous-time modeling of tracer kinetics without any discretization of the enhancement curves. Such an approach will enable estimation of the time lag between onset time points of input and response enhancements as well as other kinetic parameters in four-phase dynamic CT. We hypothesize that the proposed tracer kinetic model can be an effective imaging biomarker for the risk stratification of recurrence of CRC and for prediction of OS. To explore these hypotheses, the specific aims of the proposed project are (1) Develop a novel single-input continuous-time tracer kinetic model without any discretization to fit  temporal enhancement curves in four-phase dynamic CT of the colon, and (2) develop kinetic-model-based imaging biomarkers from four-phase dynamic CT and evaluate their performance in predicting clinical outcome in CRC patients. Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. Using such a biomarker to optimize therapy will provide patients with more effective treatment, thus reducing side effects associated with unnecessary therapeutic regimens. In addition, use of this biomarker may result in cost savings in treatment by reducing frequency of follow-up examinations in patients with a low risk of recurrence.",Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC,8757781,R21CA187877,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cost Savings', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier Transform', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stratification', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor stage', 'United States', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal aorta', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'response']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2014,227070,-0.035084092553604125
"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional     DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of statistical frameworks and methods for the analysis of complex ultra-high-dimensional biomedical imaging.

"Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography  Project Summary/Abstract  Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease by imaging the left ventricle (LV) of the heart at rest and then after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia. However, acquisitions are heavily operator dependent, two-dimensional (2D), and interpretation is generally based on qualitative assessment. While a variety of quan- titative 2D approaches have been proposed in the research literature, none have been shown to be superior to the still highly variable qualitative visual comparison of rest/stress echocardiographic image sequences for detecting ischemic disease. Here, we propose that the way forward must focus on a new computational im- age analysis paradigm for quantitative 4D (three spatial dimensions plus time) stress echocardiography. Our strategy integrates information derived from both radiofrequency (RF) and B-mode echocardiographic images acquired using a matrix array probe. The integrated analysis system will yield accurate and robust measures of strain and strain rate - at rest, stress and differentiallly between rest and stress - that will identify my- ocardial tissue at-risk after dobutamine-induced stress. This work will involve the development of novel (1) phase-sensitive, correlation-based RF ultrasound speckle tracking to estimate mid-wall displacements, (2) ma- chine learning techniques to localize the LV bounding surfaces and their displacements from B-mode data, (3) a meshless integration approach based on radial basis functions (RBFs) and Bayesian reasoning/sparse coding to estimate dense spatiotemporal parameters of strain and strain rate and (4) non-rigid registration of rest and stress image sequences to develop unique, 3D differential deformation parameters. The quantitative approach will be validated with implanted sonomicrometers and microsphere-derived flows using an acute canine model of stenosis. The ability of deformation and differential deformation derived from 4D stress echocardiography to detect new myocardial tissue at-risk in the presence of existing infarction will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic canine model of infarction with superimposed ischemia. The technique will be translated to hu- mans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility of our deformation and differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Three main collaborators will team on this work. A group led by Matthew O'Donnell from the University of Washington will develop the RF-based speckle tracking methods. An image analysis group led by the PI James Duncan at Yale University will develop methods for segmentation, shape tracking, dense displacement integration and strain computation. A cardiology/physiology group under Dr. Albert Sinusas at Yale will perform the acute and chronic canine studies and the human stress echo studies. A consultant from Philips Medical Systems will work with the entire team to bridge the ultrasound image acquisition technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease are commonly performed using stress echocardiography, a test that is performed 3 million times in the United States annually. Our new methods will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation in 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) due to stress using a cost efficient and noninvasive imaging technology. The resulting methodology may lead to more sensitive and accurate detection of stress-induced ischemia that will better guide clinical decision making.            ",Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography,8614454,R01HL121226,"['Acute', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiology', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diastole', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dobutamine', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Frequencies', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Radio', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'elastography', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,819740,0.016329490351501795
"Quantitative Image Analysis Techniques for Optic Nerve Disease  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Disorders of the optic nerve (ON) account for a significant percentage of the 20 most impactful ophthalmological conditions. Collectively, diseases of the ON are the number one cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and present serious public health concerns in the U.S. Consider, for example, that glaucoma impacts more than three million Ameri- cans and costs the U.S. economy almost $3 billion per year. Optic neuritis (i.e., inflammatory demyelination of the ON) is the initial symptom in ~25% of all multiple sclerosis (MS) cases (which impacts over 400 thousand Americans and intro- duces societal health care costs of nearly $30 billion per year). Nearly two thirds of MS patients will experience episodes of optic neuritis in their lifetimes, and 40-60% of patients have visual defects localized to the ON. These disorders irre- versibly damage the ON. Even so, damage to axons in the ON is progressive, defined by a window of opportunity for treatment between loss of function and actual degeneration. The potential for recovery exists because there are treatments that can help prevent progression if administered during this window of opportunity. Yet, we do not have effective means to assess who is in the window and who will benefit from treatment.  We propose to translate computational imaging methods from the neuroimaging community to provide ro- bust, quantitative tools for assessing the optic nerve (ON) on clinical and research imaging sequences. These efforts will improve prognostic accuracy, lead to better understanding of patient responses, and enhance targeted interven- tions. The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse ON data from modern MRI and CT clinical sequences. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative ON phenotypes on longitudinal clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who respond to treatment versus those who do not.  The overall goal of this research is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the ON and its relationships with pathological disorders. We will build upon recent advances in robust medical image computing to segment the ON in clinical CT and MRI acquisitions, develop registration procedures to establish intra- and inter-subject correspondence, and bring together information from the multi-modal battery of imaging studies that are typically used in clinical care (aim 1). With these new methods, we will address the exploratory hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging data can increase prognostic accuracy (aim 2). We note that aim 2 is particularly exploratory and in line with the high- risk/high-reward aspect of this mechanism; many studies have shown that baseline imaging does not conclusively pre- dict long term outcome or treatment response. We hypothesize that this may be because early findings are related to edema and inflammation rather than cellular damage per se. Once this exploratory phase is complete, we will pursue promising prognostic biomarkers using more detailed condition staging criteria and including more than two longitudinal time points in the analysis. Ultimately, these efforts will improve assessment ON disease and, in turn, patient care.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.        Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project will combine attributes of advanced ultrasound and magnetic-resonance techniques and embody them in a prototype imaging system capable of generating novel tissue-type images that reliably depict PCa in real-time.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,8761531,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Build-it', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'research study', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2014,611476,0.032633908415425725
"Decision support with MRI for targeting, evaluating laser ablation for prostate c     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For a growing population of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (CaP) patients, active surveillance may be biologically or psychologically undesirable. Yet the short- and long-term complications and co-morbidities associated with radical whole-organ therapies (e.g. intensity modulated radiation therapy) are still associated with a risk of treatment-related morbidity. With radical whole gland therapies, in certain patients who are more sensitive to radiation treatment, high dosage spots in the rectum and in the bladder can lead to complications including chronic rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms such as cystitis. Laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a novel form of controlled, targeted thermal ablation that may offer measurable advantages over other ablative therapies for focal prostate therapy. Because LITT is MRI compatible, it enables an imaging advantage over other surgical or ablation techniques that utilize transrectal ultrasound to target and monitor treatment. However successful adoption of focal therapy for the treatment of CaP will hinge on several critical issues: 1) Can we accurately identify index lesions and cancers within the prostate? 2) Appropriate follow-up of patients treated with focal therapy and 3) How to detect recurrent/persistent disease? The introduction of multi-parametric (MP) MRI (T2w, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), Diffusion (DWI)) has allowed for (1) improved detection sensitivity and specificity for CaP localization, and (2) evaluating treatment response in the prostate. However there exists a need for (1) novel computational image analysis tools to quantitatively integrate MP-MRI parameters for improved CaP classification in vivo and (2) non-rigid registration tools for enabling targeted therapy and evaluation of post-treatment changes.  In this study we will employ sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic (CAD) and deformable registration tools in conjunction with MP-MRI to be used in conjunction with a small clinical trial involving 40 patients with documented CaP for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI to thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via LITT, and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation. Regions identified via CAD on pre-LITT MRI will be targeted for therapy, while on post-LITT MP-MRI, regions identified as being suspicious for CaP recurrence (on account of large changes in MR imaging markers) will be evaluated via needle core biopsy. The tools developed in this project will be integrated into a practical and feasible treatment paradigm for focal treatment of low-risk localized CaP which will allow patients to avoid the complications associated with radical whole-gland therapy. This inter-disciplinary, translational project combines engineering expertise in terms of CAD on MP-MRI, multimodal image registration and machine learning and clinical expertise in interventional radiology, prostate MRI, and MRI guided focal therapy.          In this study we will leverage sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic and deformable registration tools in conjunction with multi-parametric (MP) MRI in prostate cancer (CaP) patients for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI and thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation.

"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.

"Decision support for dose prescription in radiation treatment planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent advances in radiation therapy [1], such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT), offer the ability to maximize tumor control while reducing the risk of radiation-induced damage to adjacent normal tissue. Typically, radiation therapy involves three phases: (1) prescription - where radiation oncologists (physicians) specify the dose constraints for targets and organs at risk (OAR); (2) planning - where treatment planners (physicists, dosimetrists) determine the treatment parameters to achieve the prescribed dose constraints; and (3) treatment - where therapists carry out the plan to treat the patients. In current practice, radiation oncologists typically draw on a variety of sources for dose prescription, including the 1991 ""Emami"" paper [8] on normal tissue tolerance, updated guidance from QUANTEC, other data in journals and texts, and their personal experiences. While these provide a general understanding of the dependence of normal tissue complication on dose distribution or the upper limits of the organ tolerance in populations of patients, their application to an individual patient is less certain and precise. Application of data and guidelines that are available in the literature is further complicated by the fact that this information is available only as narrative texts, tables and charts that are difficult to quantitatively integrate into clinical practice. Furthermore, the existing guidelines do not consider patient specific information regarding the ideal dose distribution achievable at individual treatments [9]. Radiation oncologists are frequently forced to make difficult prescription decisions by synthesizing available population level guidelines, personal experience, and their understanding of the specific patient needs on an ad hoc basis. Our overarching goal is to improve outcome by providing evidence-based decision support for radiation oncologists, planners, and therapists in every phase of the treatment process. In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient- specific optimal dose constraints. The specific aims are (1) Provide radiation oncologists with reliable predictions of patient-specific dose distributions achievable for the patient's anatomy and tumor volume; and (2) Provide radiation oncologists with intuitive tools that integrate patient-specific dose predictions with population-based dose guidelines to support prescription decision making. We believe the technologies developed in this project will not only improve the quality of radiotherapy prescriptions but also reduce planning time with optimal dose constraints and improve clinical outcomes.         In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient-specific optimal dose constraints. The technologies developed in this project will not only improve the quality of radiotherapy prescriptions but also reduce planning time with optimal dose constraints and improve clinical outcomes.

"Developing a Platform for Prediction of Metastasis Using Multiplexed QD-imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexed biomarker analysis is more powerful in reflecting the biological behaviors of a tumor than single biomarker analysis, but its standardization and quantification is still a challenge. Furthermore, most computer software does not provide methods for imaging and analyzing subcellular localization of biomarkers and correlating them with biological and clinical information. The objective of this project is to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantification of multiplexed immunostaining plus bioinformatics for the prediction of lymph node metastases (LNM) from the primary tumor (PT) of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). LNM of SCCHN is a precisely defined biological phenomenon which is an ideal model to be utilized to develop this multiplexed biomarker platform (MBP). Based on our preliminary studies, we aim to test the hypothesis that that the MBP can be developed to identify the subcellular distribution and expression of multiple metastasis-related biomarkers simultaneously in PTs. Accurate quantification of these biomarkers will facilitate the prediction of metastasis from PTs. Three emerging technologies, quantum dot (QD)-based immunohistofluorescence (IHF), multispectral imaging, and machine learning will be used to test this hypothesis. Using these approaches, a platform that combines quantifying multiplexed immunostaining with biostatistics will be developed and tested for its sensitivity, specificity, and prediction power for use in the clinic. Therefore, this project fits appropriately to the scope of the NCI program announcement ""Developmental Research in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction"" (PA-09-159).  Three aims are proposed in the study. (1) To develop a multiplexed biomarker system and method based on a bulk tissue model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissues. This Aim will establish and validate an analysis methodology for multiplexed quantification of membrane and cytoplasmic staining using a new function in InForm software where subcellular localization of certain biomarkers will be specifically analyzed. Prediction of LNM based on this bulk tissue model will be achieved. (2) To develop a per-cell quantification method based on a sub-population model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissue.  The per-cell analysis results will quantified as the percentage of high risk cells from the multiplexed biomarker analyses in the same PTs. The high risk population will be correlated with LNM. The sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the sub-population model will be compared with that of the bulk tissue model. (3) To develop and validate a nomogram with software combining clinical characterizations of metastasis as a working platform for the prediction of LNM. While the primary endpoint of Aim 1 and 2 is to correlate the three biomarkers with metastasis, other clinical factors such as differentiation status, tumor stage, and site, etc. may also correlate with LNM. The most predictive biomarker set combined with relevant clinical factors will constitute a platform with computer software that will be validated in an additional 100 SCCHN samples for prediction of LNM.        Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application. This project aims to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantifying multiplexed biomarkers plus their correlation with lymph node metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. This platform can be used for an assessment of LNM which is paramount for appropriate treatment planning.

"Software to facilitate multimode, multiscale fused data for Pathology and Radiolo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical informatics from the macro- to micro-scale is increasingly available for a range of detection/diagnosis/theragnostic applications tailored to each patient's history and current condition. Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the second most common malignancy among men with an estimated 220,000 new cases in the USA in 2008. With the advent of multi-parametric high resolution (3 Tesla (T)) prostate MRI, providing anatomic, biochemical, and physiologic information, it has become increasingly important to identify the potential value of this information in pre-operative or pre-therapeutic CAP screening. However, in vivo prostate MRI lacks the resolution and ground truth diagnostic accuracy histopathological examination of biopsy cores provides. A first step toward getting prostate MRI for CAP into the clinic would be validating the information provided from MR at the cellular level. However, validating MRI against histological ground truth currently lacks the means to link the information provided by radiological imaging and pathology seamlessly. This is primarily due to a lack of interoperability between informatics representations and tools. One missing element, for instance, is robust and accurate image registration tools to align the multi-modal volumetric data sets. The overarching goal of this collaborative project between the University of Pennsylvania, Rutgers University, and Siemens Corporate Research is to develop and evaluate multi-modal image analysis and machine learning techniques within a software framework that will enable efficient analysis, correlation, and interpretation of multi-functional, multi-resolution patient data. The availability of these multi-modal, multi- scale analysis tools will enable alignment of radiology and pathological data which in turn will (a) enable building and validation of supervised computerized decision support systems for detection and grading of CAP from radiology and pathology data and (b) building meta-classifiers for CAP by integrating multi- modal, multi-scale disease signatures. Such a set of prostate-specific informatics tools promises clinical benefits including improved patient prognoses, more accurate disease diagnoses, and therapeutic recommendations. More generally, the tools developed as part of this project will also enable radiologic/pathologic studies in other disease entities. The specific goals of this project are 1) to develop cross-platform, open source, grid-enabled annotation, image analysis and image registration tools that will enable cross modality validation of radiology data (multi-functional 3 T prostate MRI) with expert histopathological annotation of prostatectomy specimens and provide independent computer-aided predictions of cancer extent and grade on radiology and histopathology, 2) curate an open source caGRID- connected database of prostate MRI and histopathological specimens that will enable development of quantitative signatures for detection and grading of CAP across multiple scales and imaging modalities.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a software tool kit (based on the XIP application from Siemens corporation) that will allow scientists to study prostate cancer by combining data from multiple imaging modalities (radiology and pathology) with molecular methodologies (including proteins, genes, epigenetic data). The results of this fused and combined data sets will allow scientists to create a more robust system based view of prostate cancer which allow prediction of diagnosis, follow outcomes of therapeutic treatment and facilitate discovery of new treatment options         ","Software to facilitate multimode, multiscale fused data for Pathology and Radiolo",8512667,R01CA136535,"['Active Learning', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Biochemical', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Premalignant', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Adenocarcinoma', 'Prostatectomy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer imaging', 'computerized', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease diagnosis', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interoperability', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'radiologist', 'repository', 'screening', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2013,569321,-0.02201784289146755
"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management.

"In-field FAST Procedure Support and Automation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is an ultrasound examination performed to identify intra-peritoneal hemorrhage or pericardial tamponade. FAST involves the detection of free fluid in ultrasound images from four specific abdominal areas. Unstable patients with positive FAST results are operated on, and stable patients with negative results tend to be observed.  We propose to develop the hardware and image analysis algorithms necessary for novice ultrasound operators to perform life-saving FAST procedures. The proposed system will consist of a low-cost ultrasound probe, connected to a ruggedize tablet computer, running innovative computer vision algorithms, embedded in an intuitive application. Using that system, a novice operator will be visually guided to acquire ultrasound images from the abdominal locations and quantify the free fluid in those images.  The target for our initial deployment of the system is level 3 and 4 trauma centers.

"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.            ",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,8439269,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Endoscopy', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2013,306421,-0.01879438011231259
"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional  Abstract Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of statistical frameworks and methods for the analysis of complex ultra-high-dimensional biomedical imaging.

"Coupled level set framework for retinal segmentation and atlasing in SD-OCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Some eye diseases exhibit abnormalities or atrophy of the retina, which can impair vision and cause blindness. Certain other diseases traditionally thought to be exclusively associated with the brain are now known to be associated with changes or differences in the retina, which can also impair vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging device that is enabling modern in-vivo high-resolution studies of the retina, is rapidly becoming a key imaging technology both in ophthalmology, where clinical diagnoses and disease monitoring are experiencing a dramatic technical revolution, and also in neurology, where noninvasive retinal markers of brain disease are beginning to emerge. A key limitation in the current technology is the lack of detailed, accurate, and fully-automated analysis of the retinal layers that are observed throughout the retina in a typical three-dimensional spectral domain (SD)-OCT exam. Although tools are beginning to appear in association with commercial devices, they are currently lacking in sophistication and are not validated or standardized across manufacturers. This deficiency is problematic for both clinical and scientific application of SD-OCT since the measurements are not of known precision and are therefore not easily compared both in the same subject longitudinally and in population cross sections. The proposed research takes advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms that are emerging in both computer vision and medical imaging and will apply, adapt, and extend them to the specific application of layer segmentation in three-dimensional retinal SD-OCT. Advanced tools for population averaging in a normalized space will also be developed specifically for retinal SD-OCT data. The methods will be validated against manual segmentation and normalization on both normal subjects and patients experiencing retinal degeneration largely associated with thinning of selective layers of the retina. Scans of patients with diseases causing significant retinopathy such as cysts, detachment, or scarring will be evaluated, but further development beyond the present research is expected to be needed to properly segment and quantify such cases. The developed software will be developed within the open-source Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) framework and released as open source software.        The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina. Segmentation and quantification of the characteristics of nerve layers within the retina is expected to be of great use on both ophthalmology and neurology, where the retina can be a sensitive indicator of both vision and neurological problems or diseases. Open source software written in a highly portable language will be made available to the research community at the conclusion of the research grant.

"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.

"ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS No abstract available PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All skilled clinical practitioners and interpreters of ultrasound studies realize that much information exists in recorded US images that is processed immediately by the visual cortex and is useful for qualitatively defining pathology, yet defies ready quantification by any robust algorithm. Traditional energy-based representations display grayscale intensities and speckle patterns that have been mapped parametrically into various tissue classification schemes that have yet to demonstrate organ or tissue specificity, although progress has been reported in distinguishing pathologies over the last 30 years. However, the fact that US signal processing and representation of backscatter data in terms of energy functions has not changed over the last 50 years suggests that alternative signal processing schemes may be indicated to represent the richness of the information contained within the backscattered data. To meet this challenge, we have been involved over the past 10 years in processing backscattered RF to create ""information"" images and in designing ""information sensitive"" approaches to classifying the data sets based on statistical analysis of these images These novel and user independent metrics utilize the entropy of windowed segments of radiofrequency (RF) backscatter signal from tis- sue, which represents a radical departure from grayscale or speckle metrics. In this approach the entropy of the backscattered segment is used to produce a pixel value in the tissue image. This processing strategy has proven to be sensitive to weak, sub-resolution sized changes in tissue.            ",ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS,8636638,R21EB018095,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Base Composition', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Expeditions', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Fractals', 'Frequencies', 'Heart', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Microscopic', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Radio', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data reduction', 'design', 'detector', 'heart motion', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'n-dimensional', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'sound', 'tissue processing', 'vector']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,228000,-0.006032647085104088
"Decision support with MRI for targeting, evaluating laser ablation for prostate c     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For a growing population of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (CaP) patients, active surveillance may be biologically or psychologically undesirable. Yet the short- and long-term complications and co-morbidities associated with radical whole-organ therapies (e.g. intensity modulated radiation therapy) are still associated with a risk of treatment-related morbidity. With radical whole gland therapies, in certain patients who are more sensitive to radiation treatment, high dosage spots in the rectum and in the bladder can lead to complications including chronic rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms such as cystitis. Laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a novel form of controlled, targeted thermal ablation that may offer measurable advantages over other ablative therapies for focal prostate therapy. Because LITT is MRI compatible, it enables an imaging advantage over other surgical or ablation techniques that utilize transrectal ultrasound to target and monitor treatment. However successful adoption of focal therapy for the treatment of CaP will hinge on several critical issues: 1) Can we accurately identify index lesions and cancers within the prostate? 2) Appropriate follow-up of patients treated with focal therapy and 3) How to detect recurrent/persistent disease? The introduction of multi-parametric (MP) MRI (T2w, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), Diffusion (DWI)) has allowed for (1) improved detection sensitivity and specificity for CaP localization, and (2) evaluating treatment response in the prostate. However there exists a need for (1) novel computational image analysis tools to quantitatively integrate MP-MRI parameters for improved CaP classification in vivo and (2) non-rigid registration tools for enabling targeted therapy and evaluation of post-treatment changes.  In this study we will employ sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic (CAD) and deformable registration tools in conjunction with MP-MRI to be used in conjunction with a small clinical trial involving 40 patients with documented CaP for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI to thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via LITT, and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation. Regions identified via CAD on pre-LITT MRI will be targeted for therapy, while on post-LITT MP-MRI, regions identified as being suspicious for CaP recurrence (on account of large changes in MR imaging markers) will be evaluated via needle core biopsy. The tools developed in this project will be integrated into a practical and feasible treatment paradigm for focal treatment of low-risk localized CaP which will allow patients to avoid the complications associated with radical whole-gland therapy. This inter-disciplinary, translational project combines engineering expertise in terms of CAD on MP-MRI, multimodal image registration and machine learning and clinical expertise in interventional radiology, prostate MRI, and MRI guided focal therapy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we will leverage sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic and deformable registration tools in conjunction with multi-parametric (MP) MRI in prostate cancer (CaP) patients for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI and thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation.

"High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Computerized planning for radiation delivery via either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from linear accelerators is a complex process involving a large amount of input data and vast numbers of decision variables. Such large-scale combinatorial optimization problems are typically intractable for conventional approaches such as the direct application of the best available commercial algorithms, and thus specialized methods that take advantage of problem structure are required. Radiation treatment planning (RTP) problems are further complicated by the fact that they are multi-objective, that is, the RTP optimization process must take into account a trade-off between the competing goals of delivering appropriate doses to the tumor and avoiding the delivery of harmful radiation to nearby healthy organs. The goal of this proposal is to harness distributive computing via the Condor system for High Throughput Computing (HTC) within an RTP environment. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) To develop a Nested Partitions (NP) framework that guides a global search process for optimal IMRT delivery parameters using HTC. 2) To develop parallel HTC-based linear programming (LP) methods to efficiently solve the dose optimization problem in IMRT for each given set of beam angles or beam apertures. (3) To exploit a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment and the developed NP/LP/segmentation framework to efficiently generate multiple plans for each given patient case. (4) To couple this multi-plan framework with a decision support system (DSS) that includes planning surface models, a graphical-user-interface (GUI) and machine learning tools to prediction OAR complication in order to aid in the ranking and selection of the generated treatment plans. This proposal requires a multi-disciplinary approach that is best conducted within the framework of the Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology program announcement. It brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in medical physics, mathematical programming, industrial engineering and clinical radiation oncology that is crucial to the development of the proposed multi- plan framework using HTC in radiation therapy.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery. It will develop novel algorithms that will enable generation of superior treatment plans with the added advantage of increasing the speed of treatment planning. Further, it will allow physicians to know beforehand the quality of the treatment plan relative to the multiple treatment objectives and be able to determine the treatment complication scenario beforehand.",High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy,8271284,R01CA130814,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Generations', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Accelerator Radiotherapy Systems', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'combinatorial', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'computing resources', 'direct application', 'graphical user interface', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2012,297329,0.00709924965676486
"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician.

"Decision support for dose prescription in radiation treatment planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent advances in radiation therapy [1], such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT), offer the ability to maximize tumor control while reducing the risk of radiation-induced damage to adjacent normal tissue. Typically, radiation therapy involves three phases: (1) prescription - where radiation oncologists (physicians) specify the dose constraints for targets and organs at risk (OAR); (2) planning - where treatment planners (physicists, dosimetrists) determine the treatment parameters to achieve the prescribed dose constraints; and (3) treatment - where therapists carry out the plan to treat the patients. In current practice, radiation oncologists typically draw on a variety of sources for dose prescription, including the 1991 ""Emami"" paper [8] on normal tissue tolerance, updated guidance from QUANTEC, other data in journals and texts, and their personal experiences. While these provide a general understanding of the dependence of normal tissue complication on dose distribution or the upper limits of the organ tolerance in populations of patients, their application to an individual patient is less certain and precise. Application of data and guidelines that are available in the literature is further complicated by the fact that this information is available only as narrative texts, tables and charts that are difficult to quantitatively integrate into clinical practice. Furthermore, the existing guidelines do not consider patient specific information regarding the ideal dose distribution achievable at individual treatments [9]. Radiation oncologists are frequently forced to make difficult prescription decisions by synthesizing available population level guidelines, personal experience, and their understanding of the specific patient needs on an ad hoc basis. Our overarching goal is to improve outcome by providing evidence-based decision support for radiation oncologists, planners, and therapists in every phase of the treatment process. In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient- specific optimal dose constraints. The specific aims are (1) Provide radiation oncologists with reliable predictions of patient-specific dose distributions achievable for the patient's anatomy and tumor volume; and (2) Provide radiation oncologists with intuitive tools that integrate patient-specific dose predictions with population-based dose guidelines to support prescription decision making. We believe the technologies developed in this project will not only improve the quality of radiotherapy prescriptions but also reduce planning time with optimal dose constraints and improve clinical outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient-specific optimal dose constraints.

"Developing a Platform for Prediction of Metastasis Using Multiplexed QD-imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexed biomarker analysis is more powerful in reflecting the biological behaviors of a tumor than single biomarker analysis, but its standardization and quantification is still a challenge. Furthermore, most computer software does not provide methods for imaging and analyzing subcellular localization of biomarkers and correlating them with biological and clinical information. The objective of this project is to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantification of multiplexed immunostaining plus bioinformatics for the prediction of lymph node metastases (LNM) from the primary tumor (PT) of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). LNM of SCCHN is a precisely defined biological phenomenon which is an ideal model to be utilized to develop this multiplexed biomarker platform (MBP). Based on our preliminary studies, we aim to test the hypothesis that that the MBP can be developed to identify the subcellular distribution and expression of multiple metastasis-related biomarkers simultaneously in PTs. Accurate quantification of these biomarkers will facilitate the prediction of metastasis from PTs. Three emerging technologies, quantum dot (QD)-based immunohistofluorescence (IHF), multispectral imaging, and machine learning will be used to test this hypothesis. Using these approaches, a platform that combines quantifying multiplexed immunostaining with biostatistics will be developed and tested for its sensitivity, specificity, and prediction power for use in the clinic. Therefore, this project fits appropriately to the scope of the NCI program announcement ""Developmental Research in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction"" (PA-09-159).  Three aims are proposed in the study. (1) To develop a multiplexed biomarker system and method based on a bulk tissue model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissues. This Aim will establish and validate an analysis methodology for multiplexed quantification of membrane and cytoplasmic staining using a new function in InForm software where subcellular localization of certain biomarkers will be specifically analyzed. Prediction of LNM based on this bulk tissue model will be achieved. (2) To develop a per-cell quantification method based on a sub-population model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissue.  The per-cell analysis results will quantified as the percentage of high risk cells from the multiplexed biomarker analyses in the same PTs. The high risk population will be correlated with LNM. The sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the sub-population model will be compared with that of the bulk tissue model. (3) To develop and validate a nomogram with software combining clinical characterizations of metastasis as a working platform for the prediction of LNM. While the primary endpoint of Aim 1 and 2 is to correlate the three biomarkers with metastasis, other clinical factors such as differentiation status, tumor stage, and site, etc. may also correlate with LNM. The most predictive biomarker set combined with relevant clinical factors will constitute a platform with computer software that will be validated in an additional 100 SCCHN samples for prediction of LNM.        Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application. This project aims to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantifying multiplexed biomarkers plus their correlation with lymph node metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. This platform can be used for an assessment of LNM which is paramount for appropriate treatment planning.

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.

"New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has become a standard component of modern cardiology. In SPECT research (as in medical imaging generally), it has become widely accepted that advances in imaging hardware and algorithms should be guided by so-called task-based evaluation criteria, i.e., measures that reflect how the imaging technique will impact clinical decision making. In general, a human observer study is the gold standard for measuring task-based criteria; however, the expense and complexity of such studies precludes their routine use. Therefore, numerical observers-algorithms that emulate human observer performance-are now widely used as surrogates for human observers. In SPECT, one particular numerical observer, known as the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), has come to dominate the field. The CHO is a detection algorithm that is used to approximate the human observer's performance in detecting lesions; in the case of cardiac SPECT, the lesions of interest are perfusion defects. An imaging system or algorithm can be judged by the ability of the CHO to accurately detect defects based on the images produced. SPECT researchers now rely heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on numerical observers such as the CHO, not only to validate their final results, but also as a figure of merit that guides optimization of hardware or algorithms. Because of the central role it has come to play, the CHO and its extensions have become a major research topic in their own right. In the proposed project, our goal will be to create a suite of numerical observers that will shed light on a much wider set of clinical tasks than the CHO, and we will pursue an approach that we hypothesize will be more accurate than the CHO. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will yield an evaluation methodology that could potentially be used very widely by the research community, underpinning the development of imaging hardware and software. We will develop a software package for image quality assessment using the proposed NO approach and distribute it freely to the research community. As a by-product of the research, the proposed project will also yield a thorough task-based evaluation of major image reconstruction algorithms, and will answer the question of which sorts of data (on the spectrum from simple phantoms to clinical data) are a sufficient foundation for numerical observers to perform as desired. The research will also yield the basis for a potential computer aided diagnostic system for cardiology. The specific aims of the research will be as follows: 1) Create a comprehensive set of imaging data and human observer scores; 2) Develop a suite of numerical observers based on our novel learning-based approach, as well as more-conventional statistical decision theory principles; 3) Compare and evaluate the numerical observers; and 4) Develop and disseminate by-products of the research program.          n/a",New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology,8234040,R01HL091017,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer program', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard measure', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2012,424407,0.007376452764015972
"Decision support with MRI for targeting, evaluating laser ablation for prostate c     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For a growing population of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (CaP) patients, active surveillance may be biologically or psychologically undesirable. Yet the short- and long-term complications and co-morbidities associated with radical whole-organ therapies (e.g. intensity modulated radiation therapy) are still associated with a risk of treatment-related morbidity. With radical whole gland therapies, in certain patients who are more sensitive to radiation treatment, high dosage spots in the rectum and in the bladder can lead to complications including chronic rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms such as cystitis. Laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a novel form of controlled, targeted thermal ablation that may offer measurable advantages over other ablative therapies for focal prostate therapy. Because LITT is MRI compatible, it enables an imaging advantage over other surgical or ablation techniques that utilize transrectal ultrasound to target and monitor treatment. However successful adoption of focal therapy for the treatment of CaP will hinge on several critical issues: 1) Can we accurately identify index lesions and cancers within the prostate? 2) Appropriate follow-up of patients treated with focal therapy and 3) How to detect recurrent/persistent disease? The introduction of multi-parametric (MP) MRI (T2w, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), Diffusion (DWI)) has allowed for (1) improved detection sensitivity and specificity for CaP localization, and (2) evaluating treatment response in the prostate. However there exists a need for (1) novel computational image analysis tools to quantitatively integrate MP-MRI parameters for improved CaP classification in vivo and (2) non-rigid registration tools for enabling targeted therapy and evaluation of post-treatment changes.  In this study we will employ sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic (CAD) and deformable registration tools in conjunction with MP-MRI to be used in conjunction with a small clinical trial involving 40 patients with documented CaP for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI to thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via LITT, and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation. Regions identified via CAD on pre-LITT MRI will be targeted for therapy, while on post-LITT MP-MRI, regions identified as being suspicious for CaP recurrence (on account of large changes in MR imaging markers) will be evaluated via needle core biopsy. The tools developed in this project will be integrated into a practical and feasible treatment paradigm for focal treatment of low-risk localized CaP which will allow patients to avoid the complications associated with radical whole-gland therapy. This inter-disciplinary, translational project combines engineering expertise in terms of CAD on MP-MRI, multimodal image registration and machine learning and clinical expertise in interventional radiology, prostate MRI, and MRI guided focal therapy.          In this study we will leverage sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic and deformable registration tools in conjunction with multi-parametric (MP) MRI in prostate cancer (CaP) patients for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI and thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation.

"Coupled level set framework for retinal segmentation and atlasing in SD-OCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Some eye diseases exhibit abnormalities or atrophy of the retina, which can impair vision and cause blindness. Certain other diseases traditionally thought to be exclusively associated with the brain are now known to be associated with changes or differences in the retina, which can also impair vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging device that is enabling modern in-vivo high-resolution studies of the retina, is rapidly becoming a key imaging technology both in ophthalmology, where clinical diagnoses and disease monitoring are experiencing a dramatic technical revolution, and also in neurology, where noninvasive retinal markers of brain disease are beginning to emerge. A key limitation in the current technology is the lack of detailed, accurate, and fully-automated analysis of the retinal layers that are observed throughout the retina in a typical three-dimensional spectral domain (SD)-OCT exam. Although tools are beginning to appear in association with commercial devices, they are currently lacking in sophistication and are not validated or standardized across manufacturers. This deficiency is problematic for both clinical and scientific application of SD-OCT since the measurements are not of known precision and are therefore not easily compared both in the same subject longitudinally and in population cross sections. The proposed research takes advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms that are emerging in both computer vision and medical imaging and will apply, adapt, and extend them to the specific application of layer segmentation in three-dimensional retinal SD-OCT. Advanced tools for population averaging in a normalized space will also be developed specifically for retinal SD-OCT data. The methods will be validated against manual segmentation and normalization on both normal subjects and patients experiencing retinal degeneration largely associated with thinning of selective layers of the retina. Scans of patients with diseases causing significant retinopathy such as cysts, detachment, or scarring will be evaluated, but further development beyond the present research is expected to be needed to properly segment and quantify such cases. The developed software will be developed within the open-source Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) framework and released as open source software.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina. Segmentation and quantification of the characteristics of nerve layers within the retina is expected to be of great use on both ophthalmology and neurology, where the retina can be a sensitive indicator of both vision and neurological problems or diseases.

"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.

"High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Computerized planning for radiation delivery via either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from linear accelerators is a complex process involving a large amount of input data and vast numbers of decision variables. Such large-scale combinatorial optimization problems are typically intractable for conventional approaches such as the direct application of the best available commercial algorithms, and thus specialized methods that take advantage of problem structure are required. Radiation treatment planning (RTP) problems are further complicated by the fact that they are multi-objective, that is, the RTP optimization process must take into account a trade-off between the competing goals of delivering appropriate doses to the tumor and avoiding the delivery of harmful radiation to nearby healthy organs. The goal of this proposal is to harness distributive computing via the Condor system for High Throughput Computing (HTC) within an RTP environment. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) To develop a Nested Partitions (NP) framework that guides a global search process for optimal IMRT delivery parameters using HTC. 2) To develop parallel HTC-based linear programming (LP) methods to efficiently solve the dose optimization problem in IMRT for each given set of beam angles or beam apertures. (3) To exploit a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment and the developed NP/LP/segmentation framework to efficiently generate multiple plans for each given patient case. (4) To couple this multi-plan framework with a decision support system (DSS) that includes planning surface models, a graphical-user-interface (GUI) and machine learning tools to prediction OAR complication in order to aid in the ranking and selection of the generated treatment plans. This proposal requires a multi-disciplinary approach that is best conducted within the framework of the Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology program announcement. It brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in medical physics, mathematical programming, industrial engineering and clinical radiation oncology that is crucial to the development of the proposed multi- plan framework using HTC in radiation therapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery. It will develop novel algorithms that will enable generation of superior treatment plans with the added advantage of increasing the speed of treatment planning. Further, it will allow physicians to know beforehand the quality of the treatment plan relative to the multiple treatment objectives and be able to determine the treatment complication scenario beforehand.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.           Project Narrative Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician.

"Developing a Platform for Prediction of Metastasis Using Multiplexed QD-imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexed biomarker analysis is more powerful in reflecting the biological behaviors of a tumor than single biomarker analysis, but its standardization and quantification is still a challenge. Furthermore, most computer software does not provide methods for imaging and analyzing subcellular localization of biomarkers and correlating them with biological and clinical information. The objective of this project is to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantification of multiplexed immunostaining plus bioinformatics for the prediction of lymph node metastases (LNM) from the primary tumor (PT) of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). LNM of SCCHN is a precisely defined biological phenomenon which is an ideal model to be utilized to develop this multiplexed biomarker platform (MBP). Based on our preliminary studies, we aim to test the hypothesis that that the MBP can be developed to identify the subcellular distribution and expression of multiple metastasis-related biomarkers simultaneously in PTs. Accurate quantification of these biomarkers will facilitate the prediction of metastasis from PTs. Three emerging technologies, quantum dot (QD)-based immunohistofluorescence (IHF), multispectral imaging, and machine learning will be used to test this hypothesis. Using these approaches, a platform that combines quantifying multiplexed immunostaining with biostatistics will be developed and tested for its sensitivity, specificity, and prediction power for use in the clinic. Therefore, this project fits appropriately to the scope of the NCI program announcement ""Developmental Research in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction"" (PA-09-159).  Three aims are proposed in the study. (1) To develop a multiplexed biomarker system and method based on a bulk tissue model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissues. This Aim will establish and validate an analysis methodology for multiplexed quantification of membrane and cytoplasmic staining using a new function in InForm software where subcellular localization of certain biomarkers will be specifically analyzed. Prediction of LNM based on this bulk tissue model will be achieved. (2) To develop a per-cell quantification method based on a sub-population model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissue.  The per-cell analysis results will quantified as the percentage of high risk cells from the multiplexed biomarker analyses in the same PTs. The high risk population will be correlated with LNM. The sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the sub-population model will be compared with that of the bulk tissue model. (3) To develop and validate a nomogram with software combining clinical characterizations of metastasis as a working platform for the prediction of LNM. While the primary endpoint of Aim 1 and 2 is to correlate the three biomarkers with metastasis, other clinical factors such as differentiation status, tumor stage, and site, etc. may also correlate with LNM. The most predictive biomarker set combined with relevant clinical factors will constitute a platform with computer software that will be validated in an additional 100 SCCHN samples for prediction of LNM.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application. This project aims to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantifying multiplexed biomarkers plus their correlation with lymph node metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management.

"New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has become a standard component of modern cardiology. In SPECT research (as in medical imaging generally), it has become widely accepted that advances in imaging hardware and algorithms should be guided by so-called task-based evaluation criteria, i.e., measures that reflect how the imaging technique will impact clinical decision making. In general, a human observer study is the gold standard for measuring task-based criteria; however, the expense and complexity of such studies precludes their routine use. Therefore, numerical observers-algorithms that emulate human observer performance-are now widely used as surrogates for human observers. In SPECT, one particular numerical observer, known as the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), has come to dominate the field. The CHO is a detection algorithm that is used to approximate the human observer's performance in detecting lesions; in the case of cardiac SPECT, the lesions of interest are perfusion defects. An imaging system or algorithm can be judged by the ability of the CHO to accurately detect defects based on the images produced. SPECT researchers now rely heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on numerical observers such as the CHO, not only to validate their final results, but also as a figure of merit that guides optimization of hardware or algorithms. Because of the central role it has come to play, the CHO and its extensions have become a major research topic in their own right. In the proposed project, our goal will be to create a suite of numerical observers that will shed light on a much wider set of clinical tasks than the CHO, and we will pursue an approach that we hypothesize will be more accurate than the CHO. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will yield an evaluation methodology that could potentially be used very widely by the research community, underpinning the development of imaging hardware and software. We will develop a software package for image quality assessment using the proposed NO approach and distribute it freely to the research community. As a by-product of the research, the proposed project will also yield a thorough task-based evaluation of major image reconstruction algorithms, and will answer the question of which sorts of data (on the spectrum from simple phantoms to clinical data) are a sufficient foundation for numerical observers to perform as desired. The research will also yield the basis for a potential computer aided diagnostic system for cardiology. The specific aims of the research will be as follows: 1) Create a comprehensive set of imaging data and human observer scores; 2) Develop a suite of numerical observers based on our novel learning-based approach, as well as more-conventional statistical decision theory principles; 3) Compare and evaluate the numerical observers; and 4) Develop and disseminate by-products of the research program.          n/a",New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology,8037095,R01HL091017,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer program', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard measure', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2011,417204,0.007376452764015972
"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.              Synopsis  Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy.

"Robust BCT for Clinical Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for over 50% of the population over age 50. Despite its importance, osteoporosis is largely under-treated, with less than 20% of those recommended for testing being screened. With substantial reimbursement cuts being introduced by Medicare for bone densitometry by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, the current clinical standard), with a sensitivity of DXA for fracture prediction of less than 50%, and with the rapidly increasing size of the aging population of the U.S., there is an urgent need for additional and more sensitive modalities than DXA for clinical assessment of fracture risk. Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) has emerged as a powerful alternative to DXA. This CT-based technology creates a structural ""finite element"" model of a patient's bone from their CT scans, and subjects that model to virtual forces in order to provide an estimate of the strength of the bone. Well validated in cadaver studies and being a better predictor of bone strength than is bone mineral density by DXA, BCT has also been shown to be highly predictive of osteoporotic fractures in clinical research studies. However, robustness remains an issue - can the technique be used easily by non-experts in research and clinical environments? Addressing this issue, the overall goal of this research is to improve the robustness of our software, such that it can automatically analyze scans from a wide range of CT scanners and using a wide variety of CT acquisition protocols, including new low-dose protocols that limit radiation exposure to the patient. Such a robust BCT diagnostic tool could then be offered as a supplementary ""add-on"" analysis to many types of CT exams taken for other purposes such as CT colonography, pelvic, abdominal, and spine exams, thus reducing hospital costs, incurring no addition radiation to the patient, requiring no change in the CT acquisition protocols, and therefore greatly increasing the number of patients that could be screened at low cost. Specifically, we propose in this Phase-I project to combine expertise in computer vision, CT scanning, and biomechanics in order to develop an automated method of ""phantomless"" cross-calibration of CT scans for robust vertebral strength assessment. Focusing on the spine, our major tasks are to perform a series of clinical studies in which patients are scanned twice using a variety of CT acquisition protocols; develop a custom external-calibration phantom and use that to determine the effects of various CT acquisition parameters on scanning standardization; and use machine learning techniques to develop a ""statistical atlas"" of the spine for automation of all image processing. We will combine these efforts to develop a phantomless BCT method that accounts for differences in image quality due to variations in CT scanners and acquisition protocols, including low-dose protocols, and that does so in a highly automated fashion requiring minimal user expertise and input. Should this project be successful, future work will further refine the techniques, extend them to the hip and quantitative analysis of muscle and other soft tissues, and address robustness of longitudinal changes for clinical monitoring.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing. Early identification of those at risk for fracture can guide prevention and treatment, and BCT will provide a means for such detection with a sensitivity and specificity lacking in DXA based bone densitometry. The greater radiation exposure from CT, however, limits the market for such a diagnostic. The proposed project will result in a robust diagnostic test that significantly lowers radiation dose to the patient, and in some implementations, completely eliminates additional radiation by using CT scans already ordered for other medical purposes. Successful development of this product will broaden the pool of individuals who will benefit from a more accurate and sensitive fracture risk prediction, expand the market for O. N. Diagnostics' business, and result in an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing.

"High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Computerized planning for radiation delivery via either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from linear accelerators is a complex process involving a large amount of input data and vast numbers of decision variables. Such large-scale combinatorial optimization problems are typically intractable for conventional approaches such as the direct application of the best available commercial algorithms, and thus specialized methods that take advantage of problem structure are required. Radiation treatment planning (RTP) problems are further complicated by the fact that they are multi-objective, that is, the RTP optimization process must take into account a trade-off between the competing goals of delivering appropriate doses to the tumor and avoiding the delivery of harmful radiation to nearby healthy organs. The goal of this proposal is to harness distributive computing via the Condor system for High Throughput Computing (HTC) within an RTP environment. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) To develop a Nested Partitions (NP) framework that guides a global search process for optimal IMRT delivery parameters using HTC. 2) To develop parallel HTC-based linear programming (LP) methods to efficiently solve the dose optimization problem in IMRT for each given set of beam angles or beam apertures. (3) To exploit a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment and the developed NP/LP/segmentation framework to efficiently generate multiple plans for each given patient case. (4) To couple this multi-plan framework with a decision support system (DSS) that includes planning surface models, a graphical-user-interface (GUI) and machine learning tools to prediction OAR complication in order to aid in the ranking and selection of the generated treatment plans. This proposal requires a multi-disciplinary approach that is best conducted within the framework of the Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology program announcement. It brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in medical physics, mathematical programming, industrial engineering and clinical radiation oncology that is crucial to the development of the proposed multi- plan framework using HTC in radiation therapy.

"A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A decade ago when microarray was first invented, it was hailed as ""an array of hope"" in Nature Genetics and has received a considerable amount of attention in biomedicine. Subsequently it has been called ""an array of problems"" in Nature Review. An inherent problem with microarray gene expression is that structural information is missing, which limits its ability in biological discovery. To overcome the poor reproducibility and accuracy of microarray imaging, there needs to be a shift in fundamental paradigms to those able to incorporate complementary and multiscale structural imaging information into microarray imaging. Fortunately, the latest progress in high resolution biomolecular imaging probe development coupled with advanced image analysis makes integrative and systematic studies of cellular systems possible. A cell can be labeled using multiscale and multimodality imaging, providing both structural and functional information. With multiscale imaging spreadsheets now available, there is an overwhelming need within the life sciences community to manage this information effectively, to analyze it comprehensively, and to apply the resulting knowledge in the understanding of the genetic system of a cell. However, the management and mining of this large-scale imaging information is limited by today's computational approaches and knowledge-sharing infrastructure. These problems represent a major impediment to progress in the emerging area of bio-molecular image informatics. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a unique genomic image management and mining system that can allow geneticists to search, correlate and integrate this multiscale and multi-modality imaging information in an easily operable fashion and further enable new biological discovery. In particular, this system will fill a void left in the current image database systems such as Open Microscope Environment (OME), e.g., the lack of analytic tools for integrative data analysis. To realize this goal, we are bringing together a strong interdisciplinary team consisting of imaging engineers, geneticists and industrial imaging scientists. Building on our diverse and complementary expertise, we are able to provide innovative and interdisciplinary approaches that combine the latest progress in image processing, imaging database design and machine learning with the development of high resolution and high throughput molecular imaging probes in genomics. More specifically, we will accomplish the following specific aims. First, we will develop a suite of algorithms for content extraction and information retrieval from high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images. This visual system will effectively manage imaging phenotype information, facilitating knowledge discovery such as identifying visually similar subtypes. Second, we will correlate quantitative traits extracted from FISH imaging with genomic structural rearrangements and gene expression patterns. Finally, we will develop a data integration approach to fuse disparate information from multi-modality imaging databases for improved characterization of biological systems.               Public Health Relevance Statement The anticipated outcome of the project will include a publicly accessible imaging database analysis system to facilitate multiscale genomic image information integration and knowledge mining. The proposed approach challenges the current paradigm by the integration of high resolution structural imaging with functional information, which promises to overcome the poor accuracy and reproducibility problems plagued with microarray imaging.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.           Project Narrative Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician.

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management. Still, early detection offers the best chances for surviving many cancers and refining the diagnostic capabilities of these modali- ties for small tumors continues to be a major research focus.

"New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has become a standard component of modern cardiology. In SPECT research (as in medical imaging generally), it has become widely accepted that advances in imaging hardware and algorithms should be guided by so-called task-based evaluation criteria, i.e., measures that reflect how the imaging technique will impact clinical decision making. In general, a human observer study is the gold standard for measuring task-based criteria; however, the expense and complexity of such studies precludes their routine use. Therefore, numerical observers-algorithms that emulate human observer performance-are now widely used as surrogates for human observers. In SPECT, one particular numerical observer, known as the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), has come to dominate the field. The CHO is a detection algorithm that is used to approximate the human observer's performance in detecting lesions; in the case of cardiac SPECT, the lesions of interest are perfusion defects. An imaging system or algorithm can be judged by the ability of the CHO to accurately detect defects based on the images produced. SPECT researchers now rely heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on numerical observers such as the CHO, not only to validate their final results, but also as a figure of merit that guides optimization of hardware or algorithms. Because of the central role it has come to play, the CHO and its extensions have become a major research topic in their own right. In the proposed project, our goal will be to create a suite of numerical observers that will shed light on a much wider set of clinical tasks than the CHO, and we will pursue an approach that we hypothesize will be more accurate than the CHO. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will yield an evaluation methodology that could potentially be used very widely by the research community, underpinning the development of imaging hardware and software. We will develop a software package for image quality assessment using the proposed NO approach and distribute it freely to the research community. As a by-product of the research, the proposed project will also yield a thorough task-based evaluation of major image reconstruction algorithms, and will answer the question of which sorts of data (on the spectrum from simple phantoms to clinical data) are a sufficient foundation for numerical observers to perform as desired. The research will also yield the basis for a potential computer aided diagnostic system for cardiology. The specific aims of the research will be as follows: 1) Create a comprehensive set of imaging data and human observer scores; 2) Develop a suite of numerical observers based on our novel learning-based approach, as well as more-conventional statistical decision theory principles; 3) Compare and evaluate the numerical observers; and 4) Develop and disseminate by-products of the research program.          n/a",New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology,7769507,R01HL091017,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer program', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard measure', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2010,420313,0.007376452764015972
"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7904306,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'premature', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,48929,0.010954455271254404
"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.              Synopsis  Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy.

"Robust BCT for Clinical Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for over 50% of the population over age 50. Despite its importance, osteoporosis is largely under-treated, with less than 20% of those recommended for testing being screened. With substantial reimbursement cuts being introduced by Medicare for bone densitometry by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, the current clinical standard), with a sensitivity of DXA for fracture prediction of less than 50%, and with the rapidly increasing size of the aging population of the U.S., there is an urgent need for additional and more sensitive modalities than DXA for clinical assessment of fracture risk. Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) has emerged as a powerful alternative to DXA. This CT-based technology creates a structural ""finite element"" model of a patient's bone from their CT scans, and subjects that model to virtual forces in order to provide an estimate of the strength of the bone. Well validated in cadaver studies and being a better predictor of bone strength than is bone mineral density by DXA, BCT has also been shown to be highly predictive of osteoporotic fractures in clinical research studies. However, robustness remains an issue - can the technique be used easily by non-experts in research and clinical environments? Addressing this issue, the overall goal of this research is to improve the robustness of our software, such that it can automatically analyze scans from a wide range of CT scanners and using a wide variety of CT acquisition protocols, including new low-dose protocols that limit radiation exposure to the patient. Such a robust BCT diagnostic tool could then be offered as a supplementary ""add-on"" analysis to many types of CT exams taken for other purposes such as CT colonography, pelvic, abdominal, and spine exams, thus reducing hospital costs, incurring no addition radiation to the patient, requiring no change in the CT acquisition protocols, and therefore greatly increasing the number of patients that could be screened at low cost. Specifically, we propose in this Phase-I project to combine expertise in computer vision, CT scanning, and biomechanics in order to develop an automated method of ""phantomless"" cross-calibration of CT scans for robust vertebral strength assessment. Focusing on the spine, our major tasks are to perform a series of clinical studies in which patients are scanned twice using a variety of CT acquisition protocols; develop a custom external-calibration phantom and use that to determine the effects of various CT acquisition parameters on scanning standardization; and use machine learning techniques to develop a ""statistical atlas"" of the spine for automation of all image processing. We will combine these efforts to develop a phantomless BCT method that accounts for differences in image quality due to variations in CT scanners and acquisition protocols, including low-dose protocols, and that does so in a highly automated fashion requiring minimal user expertise and input. Should this project be successful, future work will further refine the techniques, extend them to the hip and quantitative analysis of muscle and other soft tissues, and address robustness of longitudinal changes for clinical monitoring.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing. Early identification of those at risk for fracture can guide prevention and treatment, and BCT will provide a means for such detection with a sensitivity and specificity lacking in DXA based bone densitometry. The greater radiation exposure from CT, however, limits the market for such a diagnostic. The proposed project will result in a robust diagnostic test that significantly lowers radiation dose to the patient, and in some implementations, completely eliminates additional radiation by using CT scans already ordered for other medical purposes. Successful development of this product will broaden the pool of individuals who will benefit from a more accurate and sensitive fracture risk prediction, expand the market for O. N. Diagnostics' business, and result in an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing.

"High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Computerized planning for radiation delivery via either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from linear accelerators is a complex process involving a large amount of input data and vast numbers of decision variables. Such large-scale combinatorial optimization problems are typically intractable for conventional approaches such as the direct application of the best available commercial algorithms, and thus specialized methods that take advantage of problem structure are required. Radiation treatment planning (RTP) problems are further complicated by the fact that they are multi-objective, that is, the RTP optimization process must take into account a trade-off between the competing goals of delivering appropriate doses to the tumor and avoiding the delivery of harmful radiation to nearby healthy organs. The goal of this proposal is to harness distributive computing via the Condor system for High Throughput Computing (HTC) within an RTP environment. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) To develop a Nested Partitions (NP) framework that guides a global search process for optimal IMRT delivery parameters using HTC. 2) To develop parallel HTC-based linear programming (LP) methods to efficiently solve the dose optimization problem in IMRT for each given set of beam angles or beam apertures. (3) To exploit a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment and the developed NP/LP/segmentation framework to efficiently generate multiple plans for each given patient case. (4) To couple this multi-plan framework with a decision support system (DSS) that includes planning surface models, a graphical-user-interface (GUI) and machine learning tools to prediction OAR complication in order to aid in the ranking and selection of the generated treatment plans. This proposal requires a multi-disciplinary approach that is best conducted within the framework of the Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology program announcement. It brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in medical physics, mathematical programming, industrial engineering and clinical radiation oncology that is crucial to the development of the proposed multi- plan framework using HTC in radiation therapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-dimensional platform for sophisticated treatment planning of radiation delivery. It will develop novel algorithms that will enable generation of superior treatment plans with the added advantage of increasing the speed of treatment planning.

"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time. Such software could be immediately made available worldwide to standard imaging workstations. For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack. It will allow doctors to identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed to avoid a heart attack, or more extensive testing, could be recommended, to confirm or rule out heart disease.          n/a",AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR,7588839,R21EB006829,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Blood specimen', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'indexing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'waist circumference']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2009,196375,0.024557734315687724
"A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A decade ago when microarray was first invented, it was hailed as ""an array of hope"" in Nature Genetics and has received a considerable amount of attention in biomedicine. Subsequently it has been called ""an array of problems"" in Nature Review. An inherent problem with microarray gene expression is that structural information is missing, which limits its ability in biological discovery. To overcome the poor reproducibility and accuracy of microarray imaging, there needs to be a shift in fundamental paradigms to those able to incorporate complementary and multiscale structural imaging information into microarray imaging. Fortunately, the latest progress in high resolution biomolecular imaging probe development coupled with advanced image analysis makes integrative and systematic studies of cellular systems possible. A cell can be labeled using multiscale and multimodality imaging, providing both structural and functional information. With multiscale imaging spreadsheets now available, there is an overwhelming need within the life sciences community to manage this information effectively, to analyze it comprehensively, and to apply the resulting knowledge in the understanding of the genetic system of a cell. However, the management and mining of this large-scale imaging information is limited by today's computational approaches and knowledge-sharing infrastructure. These problems represent a major impediment to progress in the emerging area of bio-molecular image informatics. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a unique genomic image management and mining system that can allow geneticists to search, correlate and integrate this multiscale and multi-modality imaging information in an easily operable fashion and further enable new biological discovery. In particular, this system will fill a void left in the current image database systems such as Open Microscope Environment (OME), e.g., the lack of analytic tools for integrative data analysis. To realize this goal, we are bringing together a strong interdisciplinary team consisting of imaging engineers, geneticists and industrial imaging scientists. Building on our diverse and complementary expertise, we are able to provide innovative and interdisciplinary approaches that combine the latest progress in image processing, imaging database design and machine learning with the development of high resolution and high throughput molecular imaging probes in genomics. More specifically, we will accomplish the following specific aims. First, we will develop a suite of algorithms for content extraction and information retrieval from high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images. This visual system will effectively manage imaging phenotype information, facilitating knowledge discovery such as identifying visually similar subtypes. Second, we will correlate quantitative traits extracted from FISH imaging with genomic structural rearrangements and gene expression patterns. Finally, we will develop a data integration approach to fuse disparate information from multi-modality imaging databases for improved characterization of biological systems.               Public Health Relevance Statement The anticipated outcome of the project will include a publicly accessible imaging database analysis system to facilitate multiscale genomic image information integration and knowledge mining. The proposed approach challenges the current paradigm by the integration of high resolution structural imaging with functional information, which promises to overcome the poor accuracy and reproducibility problems plagued with microarray imaging. Given the ubiquitous use of microarray imaging in biomedicine, the project is thus expected to be of great impact on the biomedical community.",A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets,7641582,R21LM010042,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Blast Cell', 'Cells', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Comb animal structure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Coupled', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Hybridization Array', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Karyotype', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Microscope', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Prevention', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'complex biological systems', 'data integration', 'database design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder prevention', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'image processing', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge of results', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'mutant', 'public health relevance', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'trait', 'visual map']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI KANSAS CITY,R21,2009,219972,0.03266611928417998
"Accurate detection of chromosomal abnormalities with multi-color image processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The combination of high resolution assays in genomics with microscopic imaging has been used for the detection of complex chromosomal rearrangements, a significant but difficult problem in prenatal and postnatal diagnosis, birth defect detection and cancer research. As a recently developed molecular cytogenetic technique, multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) imaging has provided rapid and high resolution detection of chromosomal abnormalities associated with cancer and genetic disorders. However, the technique is currently limited to research use and only serves as an adjunct tool to the G-banding based monochromatic chromosomal karyotyping in a clinical laboratory. A primary barrier of the technique is the lower classification accuracy when classifying chromosomes from multi-color microscopic imaging data. Therefore, the goal of this R15 project is to develop innovative multi-spectral image processing and machine learning techniques for M-FISH image analysis so that chromosomal rearrangement detection can be made more reproducible, robust, and faster, thereby significantly increasing the ability and efficacy of this newly developed cellular imaging technique. Our proposed approaches such as multiscale feature extraction, nonlinear manifold analysis and adaptive fuzzy clustering are able to target specific features of multi-spectral imaging data, promising a significant improvement over the current techniques. In order to validate the technique and bring it into clinical use, we will partner with a clinical geneticist, Dr. Merlin Butler, and a cytogeneticist, Dr. Diane Persons both at Kansas University Medical Center. In addition, we will collaborate with an industrial scientist, Dr. Kenneth Castleman, who is the pioneer in developing and commercializing cytogenetic imaging products. Through our interdisciplinary research and collaboration, we will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) develop image normalization approaches to improve the acquisition of multi-color FISH images; 2) develop multiscale dimension analysis to extract features from multi-color images; 3) design adaptive fuzzy clustering and incorporate contextual information to improve the pixel-wise classification of chromosomes; and 4) validate computational approaches with clinical testing in collaboration with medical and industrial partners. This research project will also enhance our research infrastructure in biomedical image informatics and provide undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to touch the frontier of molecular and cellular imaging by participating in the proposed research activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unraveling complex rearrangements using cytogenetic approaches such as M-FISH imaging has been extremely useful in prenatal, postnatal and cancer diagnoses. Our proposed approaches have the potential to significantly improve the reliability of the newly developed M-FISH imaging technique, making it feasible for clinical use. This will in turn benefit the health of human beings. Furthermore, the developed computational techniques can be applicable to a wide range of multi-color bio-imaging problems, thereby having a broad impact on the biomedical community.           Project Narrative Unraveling complex rearrangements using cytogenetic approaches such as M-FISH imaging has been extremely useful in prenatal, postnatal and cancer diagnoses.

"New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has become a standard component of modern cardiology. In SPECT research (as in medical imaging generally), it has become widely accepted that advances in imaging hardware and algorithms should be guided by so-called task-based evaluation criteria, i.e., measures that reflect how the imaging technique will impact clinical decision making. In general, a human observer study is the gold standard for measuring task-based criteria; however, the expense and complexity of such studies precludes their routine use. Therefore, numerical observers-algorithms that emulate human observer performance-are now widely used as surrogates for human observers. In SPECT, one particular numerical observer, known as the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), has come to dominate the field. The CHO is a detection algorithm that is used to approximate the human observer's performance in detecting lesions; in the case of cardiac SPECT, the lesions of interest are perfusion defects. An imaging system or algorithm can be judged by the ability of the CHO to accurately detect defects based on the images produced. SPECT researchers now rely heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on numerical observers such as the CHO, not only to validate their final results, but also as a figure of merit that guides optimization of hardware or algorithms. Because of the central role it has come to play, the CHO and its extensions have become a major research topic in their own right. In the proposed project, our goal will be to create a suite of numerical observers that will shed light on a much wider set of clinical tasks than the CHO, and we will pursue an approach that we hypothesize will be more accurate than the CHO. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will yield an evaluation methodology that could potentially be used very widely by the research community, underpinning the development of imaging hardware and software. We will develop a software package for image quality assessment using the proposed NO approach and distribute it freely to the research community. As a by-product of the research, the proposed project will also yield a thorough task-based evaluation of major image reconstruction algorithms, and will answer the question of which sorts of data (on the spectrum from simple phantoms to clinical data) are a sufficient foundation for numerical observers to perform as desired. The research will also yield the basis for a potential computer aided diagnostic system for cardiology. The specific aims of the research will be as follows: 1) Create a comprehensive set of imaging data and human observer scores; 2) Develop a suite of numerical observers based on our novel learning-based approach, as well as more-conventional statistical decision theory principles; 3) Compare and evaluate the numerical observers; and 4) Develop and disseminate by-products of the research program.          n/a",New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology,7837005,R01HL091017,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'computer program', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard measure', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2009,229517,0.007376452764015972

This world-class  software and development environment serves as a foundation for accelerating the development and  deployment of computational tools that are readily accessible to the medical research community. The team  combines cutting-edge computer vision research (to create medical imaging analysis algorithms) with state  of the art software engineering techniques (based on ""extreme"" programming techniques in a distributed,  open-source environment) to enable computational examination of both basic neurosience and neurologicat  disorders. In developing this infrastructure resource, the team will significantly expand upon proven open  systems technology and platforms. The driving biological projects will come initially from the study of  schizophrenia, but the methods will be applicable to many other diseases. The computational tools and open  systems technologies and platforms developed by NAMIC will initially be used to study anatomical structures  and connectivity patterns in the brain, derangements of which have long been thought to play a role in the  etiology of schizophrenia.

"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7668441,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'premature', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,275279,0.010954455271254404
"Detection of Drug Effects in Small Groups Using PET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop optimized image analysis pipelines for pharmaceutical evaluation based on functional neuroimaging, in particular based on positron emission tomography (PET). Strength of drug effect will be assessed using statistical measures of detection power, reproducibility of spatial activation patterns, and regional power estimates. Spatial parametric images will be computed for each of the prediction models investigated. A wide range of predictive models, including many that are new to the functional neuroimaging field, will be implemented and evaluated within a sophisticated statistical resampling framework. A grid-aware software package will be developed based on the results obtained.

"Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging tool but many important clinical applications are limited by long scan times and/or poor SNR. This proposal aims to improve the speed of MRI without losing SNR, through a Bayesian inference approach. Improvement in scan speed can enable new time-critical clinical and diagnostic MR applications, like cardiac imaging, time-resolved 4D coronary angiography, high-resolution volumetric brain imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced imaging, etc. A Bayesian framework for the reconstruction of raw MR data from multiple coils in parallel will be developed. This framework makes it possible to reduce the time taken during scanning multiple times by reducing the sampling rate of raw MR data. Our method will be generally applicable to most MR imaging modalities, targets and sampling schemes. Our method will then be validated and tested on the specific clinical application of volumetric structural brain imaging, which is an important procedure for the detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, tumors, white matter lesions, measuring brain atrophy and hippocampal subfields, etc. The main goal of this project is to create a set of computational tools to perform the reconstruction of accelerated MRI data on arbitrary imaging targets, modalities and acquisition schemes, including random sampling schemes. Design of models to capture prior spatial information about images will be undertaken. Finally, the method will be validated on structural brain data in terms of metrics like SNR, partial voluming, test- retest repeatability, and the performance of subsequent processing steps like image segmentation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to make clinical MR imaging much faster than currently possible. This will make many time-critical clinical applications of MRI more feasible, for instance real-time MRI of the heart. The resolving power of MRI to image finer, clinically interesting anatomical features will also increase, making more reliable diagnosis possible.          n/a",Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S,7688029,R21EB008138,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'expectation', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'model design', 'nervous system disorder', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tumor', 'white matter']",NIBIB,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2009,211250,0.033425935049675136
"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time. Such software could be immediately made available worldwide to standard imaging workstations. For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack. It will allow doctors to identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed to avoid a heart attack, or more extensive testing, could be recommended, to confirm or rule out heart disease.          n/a",AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR,7470355,R21EB006829,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Blood specimen', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Invasive', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cysteine rich protein', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'human FAT protein', 'indexing', 'novel', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'waist circumference']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2008,245025,0.024557734315687724
"Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Conventional ROC analysis has been widely accepted as a standard in the assessment of diagnostic techniques for binary diagnoses. Many medical diagnoses, however, involve multiple diagnostic alternatives. Examples are breast cancer diagnosis using mammography, where the diagnostic classes are normal, benign, or malignant tumor, and cardiac disease diagnosis using myocardial perfusion SPECT (MRS), where the classes are normal, reversible or fixed defect. To assess multi-class diagnostic techniques, multi-class ROC is required, but has remained an unsolved problem ever since the introduction of binary ROC analysis in the 1950s. Sparked by a practical challenge raised by MPS optimization, the candidate proposed a three- class ROC analysis method that extends and unifies the decision theoretic, linear discriminant analysis and probabilistic foundations of binary ROC in a three-class paradigm. She has conducted five preliminary studies on three-class ROC analysis: (1) deriving its decision model [He, Metz, et.al IEEE Trans Med Imag (TMI) vol. 25(5), 2006]; (2) investigating its decision theoretic foundation [He and Frey, TMI, vol. 25(8), 2006]; (3) exploring its linear discriminant analysis (LDA) foundation [He and Frey, TMI, in press, 2006]; (4) establishing its probabilistic foundation; and (5) comparing it with conventional three-class LDA and revealing the limitations of conventional three-class LDA. The candidate obtained a PhD in Biomedical Engineering in December 2005 and had intensive training on medical imaging. She increased her interest in medical image quality assessment during the development of three-class ROC analysis; her knowledge of the statistics and decision theory principals used in this research is self-taught. Further exploring new areas opened by three- class ROC analysis requires systematic understanding of the statistical principles in decision theory, statistical learning, and Bayesian modeling, etc. Thus, she requests a two-year mentored phase focusing on formal biostatistics training. The training phase will substantially enhance the candidate's career development as an interdisciplinary investigator and contribute to her independent research to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) to establish the theoretical foundations of three-class ROC analysis; (2) to develop general statistical methods for three-class ROC analysis; (3) to apply the three-class methodologies to task-based medical image quality assessment. The significance of the proposed work is two-fold. First, it provides a rigorous solution to an open theoretical problem and will open new areas of theoretical research in ROC analysis and medical decision making. Second, it enables applications of task-based assessment techniques for multi-class diagnosis. These techniques have the potential to fundamentally improve current imaging techniques for disease detection and characterization, and thus to enhance doctors' performance in disease diagnosis, which will broadly benefit public health.          n/a",Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment,7480255,K99EB007620,"['Area', 'Benign', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical assessment', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'statistics']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2008,89733,-0.012859303810671298
"New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging has become a standard component of modern cardiology. In SPECT research (as in medical imaging generally), it has become widely accepted that advances in imaging hardware and algorithms should be guided by so-called task-based evaluation criteria, i.e., measures that reflect how the imaging technique will impact clinical decision making. In general, a human observer study is the gold standard for measuring task-based criteria; however, the expense and complexity of such studies precludes their routine use. Therefore, numerical observers-algorithms that emulate human observer performance-are now widely used as surrogates for human observers. In SPECT, one particular numerical observer, known as the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), has come to dominate the field. The CHO is a detection algorithm that is used to approximate the human observer's performance in detecting lesions; in the case of cardiac SPECT, the lesions of interest are perfusion defects. An imaging system or algorithm can be judged by the ability of the CHO to accurately detect defects based on the images produced. SPECT researchers now rely heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on numerical observers such as the CHO, not only to validate their final results, but also as a figure of merit that guides optimization of hardware or algorithms. Because of the central role it has come to play, the CHO and its extensions have become a major research topic in their own right. In the proposed project, our goal will be to create a suite of numerical observers that will shed light on a much wider set of clinical tasks than the CHO, and we will pursue an approach that we hypothesize will be more accurate than the CHO. Therefore, the proposed research is significant because it will yield an evaluation methodology that could potentially be used very widely by the research community, underpinning the development of imaging hardware and software. We will develop a software package for image quality assessment using the proposed NO approach and distribute it freely to the research community. As a by-product of the research, the proposed project will also yield a thorough task-based evaluation of major image reconstruction algorithms, and will answer the question of which sorts of data (on the spectrum from simple phantoms to clinical data) are a sufficient foundation for numerical observers to perform as desired. The research will also yield the basis for a potential computer aided diagnostic system for cardiology. The specific aims of the research will be as follows: 1) Create a comprehensive set of imaging data and human observer scores; 2) Develop a suite of numerical observers based on our novel learning-based approach, as well as more-conventional statistical decision theory principles; 3) Compare and evaluate the numerical observers; and 4) Develop and disseminate by-products of the research program.          n/a",New Class of Numerical Observers for Nuclear Cardiology,7355521,R01HL091017,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Play', 'Pliability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Score', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'base', 'computer program', 'desire', 'experience', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2008,431744,0.007376452764015972

"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7469332,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,275279,0.010954455271254404
"In-vivo optical molecular imaging with Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DyCE)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescence-based molecular Imaging in small animals is having a major impact on drug development and disease research. However, a significant challenge to imaging targeted fluorescent markers in vivo remains: unless the labeled regions are located superficially; localization, quantitation and host organ identification are impeded by the effects of light scattering and absorption. Orthotopic tumor and disease models are increasingly preferred over less biologically relevant subcutaneous xenografts. In such studies, substantial difficulties are encountered in longitudinal studies where animals are growing and are positioned differently for each measurement. We believe that a single imaging advance could address many of these issues, and advance the utility of in-vivo molecular imaging: an exact anatomical co-registration technique that does not rely on multimodal techniques. This proposal describes dynamic molecular imaging (DMI), an approach that can provide co-registered anatomical information by exploiting in-vivo pharmacokinetics of dyes in small animals in a simple and inexpensive way. We demonstrate that by acquiring a time-series of optical images during injection of an inert dye, we can repeatably and accurately delineate the major internal organs of mice using optical imaging alone. This is possible because each major organ is ""illuminated"" by the kinetics of dye passing through it in such a manner as to make it distinguishable from other structures. Spatiotemporal analysis can exploit these characteristic time courses to allow the body-surface representation of each organ to be visualized. These in- vivo anatomical maps can be overlaid onto simultaneously acquired images of a targeted molecular probe (detected and distinguished from the mapping dye via multispectral imaging techniques, if necessary) to significantly aid in identification of the probe's anatomical and physical location. Using CRi's existing and prototype 2D, ""2.5D"" and true 3D multispectral mouse imaging systems, we propose to test and refine a DMI approach. Based on our findings to date, we will examine and exploit in-vivo pharmacokinetics of the near-infrared dye, indocyanine green, to generate delineated surface projections of individual organs. Co-registering this surface map with surface projections of detected targeted labels will allow the targeted probe's 3D spatial location to be inferred.

Strength of drug effect will be assessed using statistical measures of detection power, reproducibility of spatial activation patterns, and regional power estimates. Spatial parametric images will be computed for each of the prediction models investigated. A wide range of predictive models, including many that are new to the functional neuroimaging field, will be implemented and evaluated within a sophisticated statistical resampling framework. A grid-aware software package will be developed based on the results obtained. This software is intended to be run in-house in a distributed computing environment at Predictek to provide state-of-the-art optimized image analysis services to its customers. A scaled-down user-friendly Java implementation of some of the best- performing methods (based on evaluations performed in the project) will also be developed for distribution to end users wishing to perform advanced analyses themselves.

"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,7467385,U24RR021382,[' '],NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U24,2008,5140823,0.013334730890348466
"Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging tool but many important clinical applications are limited by long scan times and/or poor SNR. This proposal aims to improve the speed of MRI without losing SNR, through a Bayesian inference approach. Improvement in scan speed can enable new time-critical clinical and diagnostic MR applications, like cardiac imaging, time-resolved 4D coronary angiography, high-resolution volumetric brain imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced imaging, etc. A Bayesian framework for the reconstruction of raw MR data from multiple coils in parallel will be developed. This framework makes it possible to reduce the time taken during scanning multiple times by reducing the sampling rate of raw MR data. Our method will be generally applicable to most MR imaging modalities, targets and sampling schemes. Our method will then be validated and tested on the specific clinical application of volumetric structural brain imaging, which is an important procedure for the detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, tumors, white matter lesions, measuring brain atrophy and hippocampal subfields, etc. The main goal of this project is to create a set of computational tools to perform the reconstruction of accelerated MRI data on arbitrary imaging targets, modalities and acquisition schemes, including random sampling schemes. Design of models to capture prior spatial information about images will be undertaken. Finally, the method will be validated on structural brain data in terms of metrics like SNR, partial voluming, test- retest repeatability, and the performance of subsequent processing steps like image segmentation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to make clinical MR imaging much faster than currently possible. This will make many time-critical clinical applications of MRI more feasible, for instance real-time MRI of the heart. The resolving power of MRI to image finer, clinically interesting anatomical features will also increase, making more reliable diagnosis possible.          n/a",Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S,7528771,R21EB008138,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blur', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pulse taking', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'expectation', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'model design', 'nervous system disorder', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tumor', 'white matter']",NIBIB,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2008,252375,0.033425935049675136
"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: This application responds to RFA: PAR-07-249, ""Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing"". The goal of this project is to develop and widely distribute a software package for robust measurement of brain structure in MR images by using computational neuroanatomy methods. The project will collaborate with the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) to develop the software using the NA-MIC Software Engineering Process, leverage the NA-MIC engineering infrastructure, and integrate this software into the 3D Slicer, a well-architected application environment being developed in NA-MIC. The particular software package will include both a brain image registration and warping algorithm, called HAMMER, and an algorithm for the segmentation of white matter lesions (WMLs), which can arise from a variety of pathologies including vascular pathology and multiple sclerosis. HAMMER received 2006 Best Paper Award from IEEE Signal Processing Society. HAMMER has been successfully applied to many large clinical research studies and clinical trials involving over 5,000 MR brain images and has been downloaded by 318 users from 102 institutions in over 20 countries. The WML segmentation algorithm has been successfully applied to ""Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Memory in Diabetes"" (ACCORD-MIND) sub- study, with data acquired from 4 centers on 650 patients over a period of 8 years. Designing an easy-to-use, robust software package for these two algorithms and incorporating it into the 3D Slicer will benefit a large community of end-users that need access to advanced image analysis methods in various neuroimaging studies. To increase the robustness of the algorithms to the highly variable quality and characteristics of clinical image data, further algorithm development is necessary. To increase ease of use by non-experts in computer analysis methods and integrate this software into the Slicer platform, significant software engineering efforts are planned. Three aims will be investigated. The first aim is to further develop and extend novel image analysis methods aiming at improving the robustness and performance of HAMMER registration and WML segmentation algorithms, so that they can be easily applied to various clinical research studies. The second and third aims are to design separate software modules for these two algorithms, and to incorporate them into the 3D Slicer. These two modules will be designed (1) with consistent cross-platform interactive and scripted interfaces, (2) allowing end-users to interactively explore the suitable parameters for their data, (3) enabling developers to add new functions. The robustness of these two modules will be extensively tested and improved by both software engineering tools and various clinical research data (acquired from different centers). The final software will be freely available in both source code and pre-compiled programs.

"Spectral imaging for automated malignant blast counting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We propose to extend our successful development of an agile spectral light source for light microscopy, funded through the NCI-IMAT initiative, into FDA trials. The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to ""gate"" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.      Time-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation).

"Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Conventional ROC analysis has been widely accepted as a standard in the assessment of diagnostic techniques for binary diagnoses. Many medical diagnoses, however, involve multiple diagnostic alternatives. Examples are breast cancer diagnosis using mammography, where the diagnostic classes are normal, benign, or malignant tumor, and cardiac disease diagnosis using myocardial perfusion SPECT (MRS), where the classes are normal, reversible or fixed defect. To assess multi-class diagnostic techniques, multi-class ROC is required, but has remained an unsolved problem ever since the introduction of binary ROC analysis in the 1950s. Sparked by a practical challenge raised by MPS optimization, the candidate proposed a three- class ROC analysis method that extends and unifies the decision theoretic, linear discriminant analysis and probabilistic foundations of binary ROC in a three-class paradigm. She has conducted five preliminary studies on three-class ROC analysis: (1) deriving its decision model [He, Metz, et.al IEEE Trans Med Imag (TMI) vol. 25(5), 2006]; (2) investigating its decision theoretic foundation [He and Frey, TMI, vol. 25(8), 2006]; (3) exploring its linear discriminant analysis (LDA) foundation [He and Frey, TMI, in press, 2006]; (4) establishing its probabilistic foundation; and (5) comparing it with conventional three-class LDA and revealing the limitations of conventional three-class LDA. The candidate obtained a PhD in Biomedical Engineering in December 2005 and had intensive training on medical imaging. She increased her interest in medical image quality assessment during the development of three-class ROC analysis; her knowledge of the statistics and decision theory principals used in this research is self-taught. Further exploring new areas opened by three- class ROC analysis requires systematic understanding of the statistical principles in decision theory, statistical learning, and Bayesian modeling, etc. Thus, she requests a two-year mentored phase focusing on formal biostatistics training. The training phase will substantially enhance the candidate's career development as an interdisciplinary investigator and contribute to her independent research to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) to establish the theoretical foundations of three-class ROC analysis; (2) to develop general statistical methods for three-class ROC analysis; (3) to apply the three-class methodologies to task-based medical image quality assessment. The significance of the proposed work is two-fold. First, it provides a rigorous solution to an open theoretical problem and will open new areas of theoretical research in ROC analysis and medical decision making. Second, it enables applications of task-based assessment techniques for multi-class diagnosis. These techniques have the potential to fundamentally improve current imaging techniques for disease detection and characterization, and thus to enhance doctors' performance in disease diagnosis, which will broadly benefit public health.          n/a",Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment,7298516,K99EB007620,"['Area', 'Benign', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Theory', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical assessment', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'statistics']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2007,88539,-0.012859303810671298
"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7241562,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2007,275279,0.010954455271254404

"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,7253351,U24RR021382,[' '],NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSP,U24,2007,5123449,0.013334730890348466
"Spectral imaging for automated malignant blast counting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We propose to extend our successful development of an agile spectral light source for light microscopy, funded through the NCI-IMAT initiative, into FDA trials. The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to ""gate"" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.      Time-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation).

"Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cochlea is a remarkable sensor: a living cochlea can reliably detect sounds that cause motions of the stapes on the order of picometers, is capable of high-quality frequency analysis (Q10dB > 600), and compresses the large dynamic range (120 dB) of hearing into the considerably smaller dynamic range (20- 50 dB) of neurons. It is now widely accepted that an active mechanical amplification process underlies these remarkable properties. However, there is considerable debate about the nature of the amplifier. While information on the cellular and molecular basis of hearing is increasing rapidly, there is still little understanding of how the components interoperate to generate the remarkable properties of hearing.       To date, the most successful experimental studies of cellular motions in living cochleae have used optical methods. However, current methods, such as laser Doppler vibrometry and video microscopy are limited by the low reflectivities of cochlear structures and the limited optical access provided by the intact cochea. The objective of this grant is to develop and apply a new tomographic imaging and motion measurement technique capable of determining the three-dimensional motions of all structures in a living, intact cochlea. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be used to obtain high-resolution images of the cochlea. Images will be acquired through a narrow opening similar to that used in laser Doppler vibrometry methods, or possibly directly through bone. Sequences of stroboscopic images will be generated with synchronous demodulation of the OCT detector signal during acoustic stimulation. Computer vision algorithms (similar to those used in video microscopy methods) will be used to determine motions with nanometer resolution. This technique will be applied to image and measure three-dimensional motions of the internal microstructure of an intact cochlea, including the basilar membrane, reticular lamina, tectorial membrane, and outer hair cells. n/a",Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions,6985366,R21DC007111,"['animal tissue', 'auditory stimulus', 'biomechanics', 'cochlea', 'computer program /software', 'ear hair cell', 'guinea pigs', 'image processing', 'measurement', 'neuroimaging', 'optical tomography', 'organ of Corti', 'retina', 'technology /technique development', 'three dimensional imaging /topography', 'vibration', 'video microscopy']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2006,183324,0.015969455998957126

"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7148587,R01NS055064,"['brain', 'clinical research', 'embryo /fetus']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2006,274794,0.010954455271254404

This workshop brings together 60-80           members of academia, industry, and other federal agencies, with a particular         history of involvement with the broader intelligence community in image              processing and analysis.  The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.  Among the        specific topics to be covered at this meeting are: Real-time event                   understanding,  Extraction of information from video, video compression and          decompression, and hand and body gesture recognition.

"Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Acute thrombus formation on disrupted/eroded human atherosclerotic lesions plays a critical role on the onset of acute coronary syndromes and progression of atherosclerosis. Pathological evidence has clearly established that it is plaque composition rather than stenotic severity that modulates plaque vulnerability and thrombogenicity. Therefore, the possibility of detecting and characterizing atherosclerotic lesions would have significant clinical implications. Among the different imaging modalities, MRI seems to be the most promising in terms of discrimination and due to its non-invasive nature. We propose to develop an automated MRI image analysis system for detecting, measuring, and classifying atherosclerotic plaques. The proposed project will be conducted by a highly experienced team of experts in signal processing, pattern recognition, statistics, and product development in close collaboration with key cardiovascular researchers, with specific expertise in MRI imaging and atherosclerosis. Automation would establish a fast, objective (observer-independent), and standard diagnostic measure of plaque burden, allowing for comparison of results between laboratories, throughout longitudinal studies, and across different imaging equipment. In a clinical setting, this system would greatly reduce the diagnostic costs involved in measuring the degree of stenosis and detecting thrombosis-prone plaques. n/a",Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI,6951380,R44HL071470,"['artificial intelligence', 'atherosclerotic plaque', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical automation', 'cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human data', 'image processing', 'informatics', 'magnetic resonance imaging']",NHLBI,ISCHEM CORPORATION,R44,2005,374972,0.01366592127579057
"Reconstruction Hardware for Real-Time Moving Tabel MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this project is to design and integrate instrumentation allowing the next generation of real-time image formation in MRI. The motivation comes from an existing project for forming MR images during continuous motion of the patient table. When applied to peripheral MR angiography the target is the formation of a moving table angiogram in which the table motion is precisely matched to the transit of the contrast bolus through the patient. However, implementation of this requires that a number of mathematical processes be done at high speed, including: (i) time-resolved 3D MRI of an extended field of view (FOV); (ii) determination of localized time-dependent parameters such as bolus arrival time and bolus velocity; (iii) variable ordering of phase encodings over the course of an MRI scan, allowing optimized local resolution; (iv) gradient warping correction for MR acquisition done using a moving patient table; (v) multi-coil reconstruction using the SENSE technique, allowing improved lateral resolution for a given acquisition time; (vi) MR acquisition done using a variable table velocity When implemented, these methods will allow the formation of peripheral MR angiograms with optimized, patient-specific table motion, maximum efficiency, and high spatial resolution. Specific aims are: 1. Construction of the Next Generation Real-Time Image MR Reconstruction System. The funding will allow the construction of a system enabling the real-time performance of the mathematical algorithms which perform the above processes. System design will allow the data acquisition and reconstruction to be modified in real time. 2. Incorporation of the New System into the Project of Moving Table MRA.

"Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Microscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will further develop and refine an innovative digital auto-focus technology for automated microscopy. Auto-focusing is essential to automated microscope imaging. Currently available techniques rely on various algorithms of focus computation at a single image resolution and suffer from inherent performance limitations, which affect their success and utilization in clinical and research applications. Auto-focusing for fluorescence microscopy, for example, represents a serious challenge to existing methods for desired accuracy, reliability and speed since in this case the images have very low signal-to-noise ratio and narrow depth-of-fields while specimen exposure to fluorescent excitation must be minimized to avoid photo-bleaching and formation of undesirable substances such as free radicals and singlet oxygen. We propose a novel multi-resolution image analysis approach to microscope auto-focusing, based on the recently developed mathematical theory of wavelet transform. The new approach overcomes a number of inherent limitations of currently available techniques, and holds the promise to make the measurement of the microscope focus function and the detection of best-focus imaging position considerably more accurate, reliable, and fast. This innovative technology will significantly increase the ability and efficacy of automated microscope instruments for a wide range of clinical and research applications where a large number of specimens need to be imaged and quantitatively analyzed on a routine basis. During the Phase 1 project we investigated the feasibility of the proposed technology for fluorescence microscopy. We developed software to implement the algorithms for multi-resolution focus function measurements and for in-focus imaging position search. We evaluated the new approach in software simulation on a variety of sample image stacks of cytogenetic FISH specimens, and compared it with all current best-performing methods for microscope auto-focusing using the criteria of (1) accuracy, (2) range, (3) robustness, and (4) speed. The Phase 1 results suggest that, by using a proper wavelet-based auto-focus function, the new multi-resolution method significantly outperforms all competing methods in each of the aforementioned performance categories, and clearly exceeds the Phase 1 feasibility criteria. In the Phase 2 project, we will further develop, refine, integrate, and validate the new technology in real-time operation environment. We plan to build a prototype system with multi-resolution auto-focusing capabilities for both fluorescence and bright-field microscope imaging. We will evaluate the system extensively for a variety of applications including genetics, pathology, and cytology. We will beta test the new system and technology in routine clinical laboratory environment and optimize the technology as end user input and feedbacks are gathered. Once fully developed and qualified, this new technology will be patented and incorporated into future IRIS automated imaging cytometry instruments. It will also be made commercially available to Applied Imaging Corporation and other manufacturers of automated microscope instruments through licensing agreements and partnerships.           n/a",Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Microscopy,6951446,R44RR016817,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'flow cytometry', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'fluorescent in situ hybridization', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'mathematical model']",NCRR,"ADVANCED DIGITAL IMAGING RESEARCH, LLC",R44,2005,318350,0.014009976890463117
"Computer Imaging to Diminish Alopecia Distress    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The goal of the research proposed herein is to develop a low-cost, user-friendly, computer-based imaging system for use by women to reduce anxiety and distress relating to alopecia (hair loss) prior to or following chemotherapy. It has been reported that 47 percent to 58 percent of women with cancer cite the likelihood of alopecia as the most disturbing anticipated aspect of receiving chemotherapy; 8 percent stated that they seriously considered refusing treatment due to this possibility. Utilizing advanced graphical processing techniques, the proposed ""Help for Alopecia through Image Representations"" (HAIR) system will permit cancer patients of all races and ethnicities to interactively visualize, using their own image, the process of hair loss, accessorization options (e.g., wigs, head scarves, hats, etc.), and the corresponding stages of hair regrowth. ""Scripting"" (i.e., rehearsing) the side effects of chemotherapy and potential patient responses will significantly reduce the anxiety caused by the prospect of alopecia.

Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to ""gate"" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.      Time-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation). FDA-sanctioned clinical trials will be conducted in the third year, leading to submission of an application for a 510(k) clearance.         n/a",Spectral imaging for automated malignant blast counting,6938339,R44CA088684,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biopsy', 'blood cell count', 'bone marrow', 'bone marrow exam', 'cell morphology', 'cell population study', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'flow cytometry', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'high throughput technology', 'histopathology', 'human tissue', 'image enhancement', 'immunocytochemistry', 'leukemia', 'light emission', 'light microscopy', 'lighting', 'molecular /cellular imaging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'spectrometry']",NCI,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R44,2005,1000582,0.012659906918568458

"Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cochlea is a remarkable sensor: a living cochlea can reliably detect sounds that cause motions of the stapes on the order of picometers, is capable of high-quality frequency analysis (Q10dB > 600), and compresses the large dynamic range (120 dB) of hearing into the considerably smaller dynamic range (20- 50 dB) of neurons. It is now widely accepted that an active mechanical amplification process underlies these remarkable properties. However, there is considerable debate about the nature of the amplifier. While information on the cellular and molecular basis of hearing is increasing rapidly, there is still little understanding of how the components interoperate to generate the remarkable properties of hearing.       To date, the most successful experimental studies of cellular motions in living cochleae have used optical methods. However, current methods, such as laser Doppler vibrometry and video microscopy are limited by the low reflectivities of cochlear structures and the limited optical access provided by the intact cochea. The objective of this grant is to develop and apply a new tomographic imaging and motion measurement technique capable of determining the three-dimensional motions of all structures in a living, intact cochlea. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be used to obtain high-resolution images of the cochlea. Images will be acquired through a narrow opening similar to that used in laser Doppler vibrometry methods, or possibly directly through bone. Sequences of stroboscopic images will be generated with synchronous demodulation of the OCT detector signal during acoustic stimulation. Computer vision algorithms (similar to those used in video microscopy methods) will be used to determine motions with nanometer resolution. This technique will be applied to image and measure three-dimensional motions of the internal microstructure of an intact cochlea, including the basilar membrane, reticular lamina, tectorial membrane, and outer hair cells. n/a",Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions,6850297,R21DC007111,"['animal tissue', 'auditory stimulus', 'biomechanics', 'cochlea', 'computer program /software', 'ear hair cell', 'guinea pigs', 'image processing', 'measurement', 'neuroimaging', 'optical tomography', 'organ of Corti', 'retina', 'technology /technique development', 'three dimensional imaging /topography', 'vibration', 'video microscopy']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2005,172385,0.015969455998957126
"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates.

The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.  Among the        specific topics to be covered at this meeting are: Real-time event                   understanding,  Extraction of information from video, video compression and          decompression, and hand and body gesture recognition.

"Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Acute thrombus formation on disrupted/eroded human atherosclerotic lesions plays a critical role on the onset of acute coronary syndromes and progression of atherosclerosis. Pathological evidence has clearly established that it is plaque composition rather than stenotic severity that modulates plaque vulnerability and thrombogenicity. Therefore, the possibility of detecting and characterizing atherosclerotic lesions would have significant clinical implications. Among the different imaging modalities, MRI seems to be the most promising in terms of discrimination and due to its non-invasive nature. We propose to develop an automated MRI image analysis system for detecting, measuring, and classifying atherosclerotic plaques. The proposed project will be conducted by a highly experienced team of experts in signal processing, pattern recognition, statistics, and product development in close collaboration with key cardiovascular researchers, with specific expertise in MRI imaging and atherosclerosis. Automation would establish a fast, objective (observer-independent), and standard diagnostic measure of plaque burden, allowing for comparison of results between laboratories, throughout longitudinal studies, and across different imaging equipment. In a clinical setting, this system would greatly reduce the diagnostic costs involved in measuring the degree of stenosis and detecting thrombosis-prone plaques. n/a",Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI,6833334,R44HL071470,"['artificial intelligence', 'atherosclerotic plaque', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical automation', 'cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human data', 'image processing', 'informatics', 'magnetic resonance imaging']",NHLBI,ISCHEM CORPORATION,R44,2004,374972,0.01366592127579057
"Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We are proposing to develop a single, bench-top animal scanner that will acquire both functional SPECT images and anatomical CT images with sub-millimeter spatial resolution for both imaging modalities. The sub-mm SPECT-CT will provide a technique for noninvasive functional imaging in mice for a wide range of applications, including the development of new radio-pharmaceuticals, assessment of new therapeutic approaches, and investigation of fundamental biological processes in transgenic and knockout mice. This would allow investigators to perform serial imaging studies in the same animal at multiple time points to investigate tumor growth, tissue pathology, the effects of therapy, and the mechanism of action of new diagnostic agents. The system will have wide applicability and significant impact in research that uses small animals to advance our understanding of human disease processes. During phase I we successfully completed all proposed feasibility studies to demonstrate SPECT/CT with gamma performance of 1.3mm intrinsic spatial resolution, E range from 30keV to 350keV, and,deltaE/E=12% at 140keV and - 100mu m CT capability from a 50xS0mm CMOS based digital x-ray detector. In addition, we acquired outstanding dual SPECT-CT images of euthanized mice. During the phase II project we will complete the integration of the high-resolution SPECT and transmission CT subsystems and develop all necessary hardware and software.

"Reconstruction Hardware for Real-Time Moving Table MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this project is to design and integrate instrumentation allowing the next generation of real-time image formation in MRI. The motivation comes from an existing project for forming MR images during continuous motion of the patient table. When applied to peripheral MR angiography the target is the formation of a moving table angiogram in which the table motion is precisely matched to the transit of the contrast bolus through the patient. However, implementation of this requires that a number of mathematical processes be done at high speed, including: (i) time-resolved 3D MRI of an extended field of view (FOV); (ii) determination of localized time-dependent parameters such as bolus arrival time and bolus velocity; (iii) variable ordering of phase encodings over the course of an MRI scan, allowing optimized local resolution; (iv) gradient warping correction for MR acquisition done using a moving patient table; (v) multi-coil reconstruction using the SENSE technique, allowing improved lateral resolution for a given acquisition time; (vi) MR acquisition done using a variable table velocity When implemented, these methods will allow the formation of peripheral MR angiograms with optimized, patient-specific table motion, maximum efficiency, and high spatial resolution. Specific aims are: 1. Construction of the Next Generation Real-Time Image MR Reconstruction System. The funding will allow the construction of a system enabling the real-time performance of the mathematical algorithms which perform the above processes. System design will allow the data acquisition and reconstruction to be modified in real time. 2. Incorporation of the New System into the Project of Moving Table MRA. Once the hardware is integrated into a useable system it will be interfaced to a clinical MRI scanner at Mayo and used in the formation of peripheral contrast-enhanced MR angiograms using continuous motion of the patient table through the scanner gantry.         n/a",Reconstruction Hardware for Real-Time Moving Table MRI,6783945,R33EB004281,"['angiography', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'mathematics', 'physics', 'technology /technique development', 'time resolved data']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC,R33,2004,361371,0.0382477152643131
"Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Microscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will further develop and refine an innovative digital auto-focus technology for automated microscopy. Auto-focusing is essential to automated microscope imaging. Currently available techniques rely on various algorithms of focus computation at a single image resolution and suffer from inherent performance limitations, which affect their success and utilization in clinical and research applications. Auto-focusing for fluorescence microscopy, for example, represents a serious challenge to existing methods for desired accuracy, reliability and speed since in this case the images have very low signal-to-noise ratio and narrow depth-of-fields while specimen exposure to fluorescent excitation must be minimized to avoid photo-bleaching and formation of undesirable substances such as free radicals and singlet oxygen. We propose a novel multi-resolution image analysis approach to microscope auto-focusing, based on the recently developed mathematical theory of wavelet transform. The new approach overcomes a number of inherent limitations of currently available techniques, and holds the promise to make the measurement of the microscope focus function and the detection of best-focus imaging position considerably more accurate, reliable, and fast. This innovative technology will significantly increase the ability and efficacy of automated microscope instruments for a wide range of clinical and research applications where a large number of specimens need to be imaged and quantitatively analyzed on a routine basis. During the Phase 1 project we investigated the feasibility of the proposed technology for fluorescence microscopy. We developed software to implement the algorithms for multi-resolution focus function measurements and for in-focus imaging position search. We evaluated the new approach in software simulation on a variety of sample image stacks of cytogenetic FISH specimens, and compared it with all current best-performing methods for microscope auto-focusing using the criteria of (1) accuracy, (2) range, (3) robustness, and (4) speed. The Phase 1 results suggest that, by using a proper wavelet-based auto-focus function, the new multi-resolution method significantly outperforms all competing methods in each of the aforementioned performance categories, and clearly exceeds the Phase 1 feasibility criteria. In the Phase 2 project, we will further develop, refine, integrate, and validate the new technology in real-time operation environment. We plan to build a prototype system with multi-resolution auto-focusing capabilities for both fluorescence and bright-field microscope imaging. We will evaluate the system extensively for a variety of applications including genetics, pathology, and cytology. We will beta test the new system and technology in routine clinical laboratory environment and optimize the technology as end user input and feedbacks are gathered. Once fully developed and qualified, this new technology will be patented and incorporated into future IRIS automated imaging cytometry instruments. It will also be made commercially available to Applied Imaging Corporation and other manufacturers of automated microscope instruments through licensing agreements and partnerships.           n/a",Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Microscopy,6833120,R44RR016817,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'flow cytometry', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'fluorescent in situ hybridization', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'mathematical model']",NCRR,"ADVANCED DIGITAL IMAGING RESEARCH, LLC",R44,2004,427818,0.014009976890463117
"Accelerated x-ray therapy planning system PEREGRINE DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computerized radiation therapy planning systems (RTP) are essential in Radiation Oncology for quantitative evaluation of radiation doses prior to patient treatment. Among currently available computational methods, the Monte Carlo method of calculating dose distributionsis most universal and accurate. It is believed that Monte Carlo software packages will become a central part of future RTP systems. The limiting problem with current Monte Carlo codes is the length of time (CPU time) required for calculations even when using state-of-the-art hardware. An increase in efficiency of Monte Carlo codes has been demonstrated using algorithms known as variance-reduction techniques (VR techniques), but the calculation times are still too long for routine  clinical use. While there is no single VR technique that would make Monte Carlo code clinically viable, a combination of such techniques usually results in improved performance. At present, the only commercial RTP system using Monte Carlo code for photon dose calculations is PEREGRINE from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NOMOS Corporation. PEREGRINE uses several VR techniques. However, it is estimated that a further reduction in CPU time by a factor of 10 would be required to have a clinically efficient system.  Our theoretical study and subsequent Monte Carlo results support a new variance-reduction technique (NVR) for photon-beam dose calculations. It is shown that NVR yields up to a 5-fold reduction in CPU time. The long-term objective of the project is to reduce PEREGRIN's CPU time from currently several hours to several; minutes. This will require a combination of NVR with other VR techniques. Within this scope, the specific aims of Phase I are:  1. Development, implementation and validation of a PEREGRINE-specific NVR algorithm.  2. Benchmarking of NVR over the range of clinically useful energies in homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms.  3. Validation of NVR in the case of patient-specific Monte Carlo calculations using CT based patient anatomy. n/a",Accelerated x-ray therapy planning system PEREGRINE,6787955,R41CA108088,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'computed axial tomography', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'electromagnetic radiation', 'mathematics', 'patient care planning', 'radiation dosage', 'radiation therapy', 'technology /technique development']",NCI,NOMOS CORPORATION,R41,2004,100000,0.017758741918644284
"Computer Imaging to Diminish Alopecia Distress    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The goal of the research proposed herein is to develop a low-cost, user-friendly, computer-based imaging system for use by women to reduce anxiety and distress relating to alopecia (hair loss) prior to or following chemotherapy. It has been reported that 47 percent to 58 percent of women with cancer cite the likelihood of alopecia as the most disturbing anticipated aspect of receiving chemotherapy; 8 percent stated that they seriously considered refusing treatment due to this possibility. Utilizing advanced graphical processing techniques, the proposed ""Help for Alopecia through Image Representations"" (HAIR) system will permit cancer patients of all races and ethnicities to interactively visualize, using their own image, the process of hair loss, accessorization options (e.g., wigs, head scarves, hats, etc.), and the corresponding stages of hair regrowth. ""Scripting"" (i.e., rehearsing) the side effects of chemotherapy and potential patient responses will significantly reduce the anxiety caused by the prospect of alopecia.

The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.  Among the        specific topics to be covered at this meeting are: Real-time event                   understanding,  Extraction of information from video, video compression and          decompression, and hand and body gesture recognition.  A five-year period of         support is requested, to enable the meeting to grow in participation and             breadth of disciplines attracted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              n/a",Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop,6644867,R13CA093819,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer human interaction', ' videotape /videodisc', ' workshop']",NCI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R13,2003,5000,0.01387184018775932
"Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Acute thrombus formation on disrupted/eroded human atherosclerotic lesions plays a critical role on the onset of acute coronary syndromes and progression of atherosclerosis. Pathological evidence has clearly established that it is plaque composition rather than stenotic severity that modulates plaque vulnerability and thrombogenicity. Therefore, the possibility of detecting and characterizing atherosclerotic lesions would have significant clinical implications. Among the different imaging modalities, MRI seems to be the most promising in terms of discrimination and due to its non-invasive nature. We propose to develop an automated MRI image analysis system for detecting, measuring, and classifying atherosclerotic plaques. The proposed project will be conducted by a highly experienced team of experts in signal processing, pattern recognition, statistics, and product development in close collaboration with key cardiovascular researchers, with specific expertise in MRI imaging and atherosclerosis. Automation would establish a fast, objective (observer-independent), and standard diagnostic measure of plaque burden, allowing for comparison of results between laboratories, throughout longitudinal studies, and across different imaging equipment. In a clinical setting, this system would greatly reduce the diagnostic costs involved in measuring the degree of stenosis and detecting thrombosis-prone plaques. n/a",Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI,6643700,R43HL071470,"['artificial intelligence', ' atherosclerotic plaque', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical automation', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human data', ' image processing', ' magnetic resonance imaging']",NHLBI,ISCHEM CORPORATION,R43,2003,99850,0.01366592127579057
"Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We are proposing to develop a single, bench-top animal scanner that will acquire both functional SPECT images and anatomical CT images with sub-millimeter spatial resolution for both imaging modalities. The sub-mm SPECT-CT will provide a technique for noninvasive functional imaging in mice for a wide range of applications, including the development of new radio-pharmaceuticals, assessment of new therapeutic approaches, and investigation of fundamental biological processes in transgenic and knockout mice. This would allow investigators to perform serial imaging studies in the same animal at multiple time points to investigate tumor growth, tissue pathology, the effects of therapy, and the mechanism of action of new diagnostic agents. The system will have wide applicability and significant impact in research that uses small animals to advance our understanding of human disease processes. During phase I we successfully completed all proposed feasibility studies to demonstrate SPECT/CT with gamma performance of 1.3mm intrinsic spatial resolution, E range from 30keV to 350keV, and,deltaE/E=12% at 140keV and - 100mu m CT capability from a 50xS0mm CMOS based digital x-ray detector. In addition, we acquired outstanding dual SPECT-CT images of euthanized mice. During the phase II project we will complete the integration of the high-resolution SPECT and transmission CT subsystems and develop all necessary hardware and software. The result will be a fully functional dual-modality prototype scanner for anatomical and quantitative metabolic imaging of small animals.         n/a",Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging,6693866,R44RR016393,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computed axial tomography', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' image processing', ' laboratory mouse', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' single photon emission computed tomography', ' technology /technique development', ' whole body imaging /scanning']",NCRR,"PHOTON IMAGING, INC.",R44,2003,379863,0.017416534537615377
"Vessel Segmentation/Registration from Ultrasound Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Ultrasound is widely used for imaging of blood vessels as it is non-invasive, real-time, and relatively inexpensive. This proposal focuses on segmentation of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) from ultrasound images with extension to other vascular imaging applications in the long term. Reliable quantitative evaluation of AAAs plays a pivotal role in diagnoses and frequent follow-up studies needed to avoid life-threatening rupture. These studies require vessel segmentation (for size analysis) and registration between serial studies (for monitoring the progression of the disease before and/or after vascular repair). AAA evaluation is routinely carried out for both high-risk patient populations and those treated with endovascular repair. Currently, AAA management is primarily based on measurements from two-dimensional (2-D) slices in CT scans. AAA monitoring and follow-up could be improved by 1) measurement from 3-D reconstructions, and 2) use of ultrasound imaging to minimize radiation exposure and reduce costs. 3-D ultrasound reconstructions provide accuracy comparable to that of CT. However, large inter-observer variability and long processing times preclude routine clinical use of 3-D image information. This research aims to develop software solutions for improved ultrasound-based AAA monitoring and other vascular diseases (in the long term). The tools used will be based on advanced image segmentation and registration algorithms involving curvature-driven image processing techniques and deformable models. The goal of the Phase I study is to establish feasibility of the proposed methods by demonstrating an improvement in the repeatability and accuracy of measurements and reduction in delineation time.         n/a",Vessel Segmentation/Registration from Ultrasound Images,6641019,R43HL069540,"['abdomen', ' aorta aneurysm', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' gastrointestinal circulation disorder', ' gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', ' human data', ' mathematics', ' three dimensional imaging /topography']",NHLBI,INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION,R43,2003,99621,0.021003685881830658
"Automated Quantitation of 3D Echocardiograms In Phase I we developed a method for automated border detection (ABD) of echocardiographic scans that is feasible for clinical application. The accuracy of our processes provides exceeds Phase I goals and is comparable to interobserver variability in measuring volume and ejection fraction, and in border location. For a diverse set of patients, we have achieved an accuracy of 10 ml for endocardial volume, 4% for ejection fraction, and ,2.0 mm for border position. Our processes operates in 4 min. In Phase II we propose to continue research and development to move our ABD technology closer to clinical user. Our first specific aim is to reduce the amount of manual input required even further. Our second aim is to develop a prototype system suitable for clinical evaluation. Our third aim is to perform a pilot trial to evaluate the performance of our ABD process, as a preparation for a more formal, multi-center clinical trial planned for Phase III. The proposed research is important because quantitative 3D echo provides greater accuracy and reproducibility and more comprehensive information on cardiac status than currently available imaging techniques. The significant advantages of 3D echo are not currently available for clinical practice because it is impractical without automation.

"Computer Imaging to Diminish Alopecia Distress    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):  The goal of the research proposed herein is to develop a low-cost, user-friendly, computer-based imaging system for use by women to reduce anxiety and distress relating to alopecia (hair loss) prior to or following chemotherapy. It has been reported that 47% to 58% of women with cancer cite the likelihood of alopecia as the most disturbing anticipated aspect of receiving chemotherapy, with 8% stating that they seriously considered refusing treatment due to this possibility. Utilizing advanced graphical processing techniques, the proposed ""Help for Alopecia through Image Representations"" (HAIR) system will permit cancer patients of all races and ethnicities to interactively visualize, using their own image, the process of hair loss, accessorization options (e.g., wigs, head scarves, hats, etc.), and the corresponding stages of hair regrowth. ""Scripting"" (i.e., rehearsing) the side-effects of chemotherapy and potential patient responses will significantly reduce the anxiety caused by the prospect of alopecia. This will serve to desensitize women to alopecia, allow them to make better-informed treatment decisions, and facilitate coping when it occurs.         n/a",Computer Imaging to Diminish Alopecia Distress,6586963,R43CA099873,"['alopecia', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' coping', ' desensitization psychotherapy', ' drug adverse effect', ' female', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' psychological aspect of cancer', ' quality of life', "" women's health""]",NCI,"BARRON ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2003,99973,-0.020084161894835906
"Novel Methods for Automated Key Image Selection    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Significant new knowledge about human behavior and the brain has come to light in recent years, due in part to rapid technical developments in imaging. As the role of imaging becomes increasingly important in neurosciences, effective methods for managing and retrieving images will become even more critical; without such advances, further progress will be hindered. The goal of this proposal is the automated summarization of large imaging sets. Image summarization proffers a method to compress imaging studies by selecting only pertinent image slices that objectively document a patient's condition; as such, its applications include multimedia electronic medical records, telemedicine, and teaching files. In Phase I, development is focused on a customizable brain atlas used for registering patient imaging studies in order to select key images. This phase addresses selection of images from ""normal"" studies and studies with only subtle morphological changes, as typical of most patients with psychiatric disorders. Automatic techniques for customizing the atlas to imaging study acquisition parameters are developed, in addition to registration methods for mapping the atlas to the patient's original study. Building from this initial work, Phase II expands to encompass selection of images from ""abnormal"" studies that exhibit gross morphological changes through principle component analysis, further customization of the atlas for different age groups (e.g., pediatric), and incorporation of structured data entry (SDE) and natural language processing (NLP) of medical reports to help guide automatic selection of key images. The resultant product will be a fully automated software system that can select relevant images from any imaging study. Initial evaluation in Phase I will examine the performance of the contrast customizable atlas and summarization/relevant slice selection, as compared to human experts.         n/a",Novel Methods for Automated Key Image Selection,6583176,R43MH065764,"['archives', ' biomedical automation', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' human data', ' image processing', ' method development']",NIMH,MEDAXIS CORPORATION,R43,2003,93365,0.004817703237377752
"SEED LOCALIZER FOR IMAGE GUIDED PROSTATE BRACHYTHERAPY Permanent implantation of radioactive seeds is a viable and effective therapeutic option widely used today for early-stage prostate cancer. Compared to external radiation therapy in which radiation must penetrate healthy tissues in order to reach cancer cells, implantation of low-energy radionuclides permits highly localized delivery of radiation.  Although the implant procedure has improved in recent years with the help of computerized treatment planning and image guidance techniques, significant enhancement of clinical outcome is expected from implementation of real-time intraoperative dosimetry and optimization. Intraoperative evaluation of dose delivery would permit identification of underdosed regions and remedial seed placement, thus ensuring that the entire prostate volume receive the prescribed dose.  However, before the concept can be realized, the problem of real-time seed localization must be solved.  This is the focus of this investigation.  The specific aims of the project include development of (1) a fully automated method to segment seed images from the fluoroscopic data and (2) a fully automated method to identify individual seed positions including those that are superposed.

"Ultrasonic Registration of Knee Anatomy to MRI Images  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will investigate the feasibility of using intra-operative ultrasound (US) images to noninvasively register the bone surfaces of the knee to preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images. A surgical navigation system, KneeNav, is being developed by CASurgica for intraoperatively planning the proper location of ligament attachment sites and drill tunnel locations and then guiding the surgeon to execute the plan. Despite agreement on the correct points of insertion, great variability exists in tunnel placement among surgeons and the rate of misplaced tunnels in ACL reconstruction surgery has been reported to be between 10-40 percent. Malpositioning of the bone tunnels is the main reason for revision surgery. The proposed research would increase the accuracy of the procedure versus current videoscopic techniques or versus competitive image guidance systems. The research plan is to establish a ""gold standard"" for registration accuracy using reconstructed CT scans, point-based surface matching algorithms, and optical tracking. Reconstructed MR models will be substituted for CT models and the accuracy reassessed. The US probe will then be calibrated and US surface collection will then be substituted for point based collection and the accuracy reassessed. Finally, registration of US directly to MR without reconstruction will be assessed.

"Reliable and Robust ECG Gating Signal for MR Imaging The focus of this project is to develop and evaluate a noel and reliable system for ECG triggering during cardiac MR imaging. Understanding the mechanism of heart failure and cardiomyopathy using MRI requires reliable and robust ECG gating (or triggering). To provide effective ECG gating, the first specific aim of this Phase I project is to design and develop an ECG lead system and concomitant signal processing methodology to allow for improved ECG detection with the magnetic. Our preliminary data describing our optimal vector signal set approach , coupled with a dual derivative ECG detections scheme, appear to be effective in reliably detecting the ECG during MR imaging. An improved ECG trigger will provide cardiac MRI imaging without the artifacts of cardiac and respiratory motion. Our second specific aim is to design and develop a wireless (telemetry) infrared (IR) system for ECG trigger transmission to eliminate the need for either wiring or a fiber optic cable during MRI examinations. Additionally preliminary data demonstrates the capability of our IR telemetry system to transmit the ECG in laboratory tests. Our optimal telemetry system will also mitigate against many of the artifacts involved in the development of an effective MRI ECG trigger. During Phase I we will demonstrate the feasibility of our system by evaluating system performance in 20 human subjects undergoing cardiac MR imaging. We believe our approach should provide a reliable and robust ECG gated trigger with minimal delay from the onset of the R-wave. Such a trigger would minimize blurring artifacts from cardiac and respiratory motion and improve MR tagging studies. Should our phase I project be successful, we would develop a real-time implementation of the entire system in an expanded Phase II biomedical engineering and extended clinical study. A successful Phase I and II project would likely receive commercial backing from a major MRI instrument manufacturer.

"Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Cytogenetics The goal of this project is to develop innovative digital microscope autofocusing techniques for automated cytogenetics applications.  We propose a novel multi-resolution image analysis approach to focus measurement and detection, based on the recently developed mathematical theory of wavelet transform.  In comparison to currently available single-resolution techniques, the proposed method overcomes their fundamental limitations and promises considerably more accurate, reliable and faster means to compute and determine in-focus image position for image acquisition.  This will significantly increase the ability and efficacy of automated scanning microscope instruments for clinical and cancer cytogenetics applications. In Phase 1 we will investigate the feasibility of the proposed method based on its utilization in fluorescence microscopy.  We will develop and implement the algorithm and software for multi-resolution focus function computation and in-focus position determination.  We will test and evaluate the new method against the current best-performing algorithms by comparing (1) Accuracy; (2)  Range; (3)  Insensitivity to other parameters; and (4)  Speed.

"Deployment Framework for Medical Imaging Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are many reasons for the relatively slow proliferation of advanced medical image processing methods but a significant reason is the present paradigm for providing access: most applications are still tied to proprietary software and hardware environments that carry significant up-front costs. The ultimate intent of this work is leverage commodity computing technologies to develop an open, extensible framework for deploying medical image processing applications in the heterogeneous, networked computing environment of today. The framework will provide clinicians and researchers access to state-of-the-art image processing applications regardless of their particular computing platform or locally available computing resources connecting them with federated database resources, with high-end computing resources, or even with their colleagues in a peer-to-peer computing environment. The aims for Phase I of this project are: (1) Demonstrate that the framework provides access to image processing applications to an extent that is largely independent of local computing resources. (2) Demonstrate that the framework is general in that the same components can be reused for deploying a wide variety of medical imaging applications. (3) Demonstrate that the framework is customizable both by third-party developers and by end-users allowing power-users to both create and deploy new applications. Work in Phase II will extend the framework and develop two-demonstration applications--computer aided diagnosis (CAD) for mammography and multimodality image fusion.

This workshop brings together 60-80           members of academia, industry, and other federal agencies, with a particular         history of involvement with the broader intelligence community in image              processing and analysis.  The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.  Among the        specific topics to be covered at this meeting are: Real-time event                   understanding,  Extraction of information from video, video compression and          decompression, and hand and body gesture recognition.  A five-year period of         support is requested, to enable the meeting to grow in participation and             breadth of disciplines attracted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              n/a",Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop,6421360,R13CA093819,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer human interaction', ' videotape /videodisc', ' workshop']",NCI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R13,2001,5000,0.01387184018775932
"ENERGY RESOLVED DIGITAL HPGE X OR Y-RAY IMAGING DETECTOR Imaging detectors for 10 to 150 keV photons have many uses in medical technology, including tumor imaging, SPECT, and radiography. Digital output is particularly useful since it allows image enhancement, analysis, transmission and storage. In Phase I we proposed a new technology that could capture images with 100 microm spatial resolution and 1 keV energy resolution or better. This capability would facilitate entirely new classes of medical diagnostic procedures, particularly for transgenic small animal imaging. Our Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In this Phase II effort, collaborating with Paul Luke at LBNL, we will construct 1 cm thick crossed-strip HPGe detectors having 10 x 10 strips, each 2 mm x 20 mm. We will develop cooled FET preamplifiers having low noise and large bandwidth properties specifically required by this approach. We will also develop analog filtering electronics to condition the detector's novel signals and employ digital pulse processing electronics to acquire these signals at rates up to 10/6 cps. Finally, we will devise procedures to test the detector's linearity and develop processing algorithms to perfect this quality. Phase II will conclude with a working and tested prototype. Phase III will entail primarily production engineering efforts. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: As an energy resolved digital detector with 100 microm spatial resolution, the proposed detector technology could find many medical applications, including SPECT, energy resolved angiography for small mammals, bone densitometry on rodent bones, and small, hand-held gamma cameras. Non-medical applications would include non-destructive testing, astrophysical gamma imaging, nuclear cleanup uses, and x-ray diffraction detectors.  n/a",ENERGY RESOLVED DIGITAL HPGE X OR Y-RAY IMAGING DETECTOR,6376544,R44CA075844,"['X ray', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' cadmium', ' clinical biomedical equipment', ' digital imaging', ' gamma radiation', ' tellurium', ' zinc']",NCI,X-RAY INSTRUMENTATION ASSOCIATES,R44,2001,373949,0.016082322183346393
"Shearography for Non-Invasive Dental Health Evaluation   DESCRIPTION: Optical holography has been applied to non-invasive clinical            diagnosis and monitoring of Dental and oral/facial pathology, but has been           sharply limited in its usefulness by its requirements of high laser coherence.       absolute stability of setup. and wet processing of holograms. Physical Optics        Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a shearographic micro-optic camera as a        novel means of non-invasive Dental evaluation and characterization based on          shearing speckle interferometry, miniature camera imaging, and proprietary           neural network image processing. The innovation in this concept is the use of        shearography to avoid the need for high stability, high temporal coherence, and      wet processing. Nearfield shearography will have high spatial resolution, and        the neural network will perform real-time data processing and display.                                                                                                    The unique high resolution. real-time operation. low cost. and miniaturization       will make this device attractive to a large commercial market in Dental and          clinical applications.                                                                                                                                                    In Phase 1. POC will develop a miniature shearographic micro-optic camera            (SMOC) with fiber light delivery. a micro-CCD imaging component. and neural          network. It will be capable of distinguishing among tooth enamel, cementum,           dentine, pulp, and soft tissue.                                                      PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  This compact, low-cost, high resolution non-invasive shearography device will represent a  technological breakthrough not only for oral diagnostics but also for biomedical imaging in  general.  Because of its high resolution, real-time operation, and immunity to vibration, it will  also have wide applications beyond the medical field, particularly for industrial diagnostics.  High-strength aerospace composite material evaluation and testing as well as weld and pipe  defect inspection are areas where it will be particularly welcome.                                                                                     n/a",Shearography for Non-Invasive Dental Health Evaluation,6404393,R43DE014307,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' dental disorder diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fiber optics', ' image processing', ' interferometry', ' lasers', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' oral health', ' video recording system']",NIDCR,PHYSICAL OPTICS CORPORATION,R43,2001,100000,0.018704667129631015
"Radionuclide imaging and therapy dosimetry system   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): The objective of this Phase I proposal is       to determine the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of      an integrated commercial treatment planning and dosimetry system (RTDS) for          radionuclide therapy and radionuclide imaging, especially for                        radioimmunotherapy (AlT). In clinical and experimental RIT, knowledge of the         absorbed dose in normal organs and tumors is essential in gaining an                 understanding of normal tissue toxicity and tumor dose response. This project        will lead to a user-friendly software program allowing physicist/physicians to       perform dosimetry analysis during AlT treatment. The software package will be        integrated into the CMS FOCUS 3D radiation treatment planning system, allowing       the delineation of organs and tumors, the co-registration of CT and nuclear          medicine image sets, and the estimation and visualization of absorbed dose in        critical tissues. User will have the option to purchase the RTDS module to           perform treatment planning and dosimetry calculation for patients receiving          radionuclide imaging and/or therapy. It will be the first commercially               available treatment planning system of this kind and will be fully supported by      CMS, inc. More importantly, this project will provide a general framework to         perform AlT dosimetry and the opportunity to standardize the dosimetry               technique and methodology used in RIT.   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This project will lead to a user-friendly software program allowing physicist/physicians to perform dosimetry analysis during radionuclide therapy and radionuclide imaging procedures. It will be the first commercially available and fully supported system.

"INFORMATION PROCESSING IN MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE This application is a request for support of the July 2001 meeting on Information Processing in Medical Imaging (IPMI'01) to be held on the campus of the University of California, Davis. During 16 previous meetings, this biennial workshop-style conference has traditionally concentrated on the latest advancements in the acquisition, processing, analysis, display, and perception of medical images. At the 2001 meeting, we intend to continue this tradition while encouraging contributions from young investigators, specifically advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty. The emphasis is on applied mathematical techniques in computer vision, microimaging techniques, and information technology. Advances reported at this meeting are especially important in the study of neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease and cancer, although applications in the area of functional genomics, orthopedics and soft tissue biomechanics are also represented. The conference attracts researchers from a broad range of disciplines, particularly computer scientists, neuroscientists, electrical engineers, cardiologists, mathematicians, oncologists, and physicists. All share an interest in improving the quality of health care through the extraction and presentation of diagnostic information from medical image data. Approximately 130 individuals will be invited to attend; there will be approximately 25-30 speakers and 25-30 poster presentations. Papers are accepted based on peer review by a 25 member scientific committee of 15-20 page manuscripts. Selected papers will be published in proceedings that will be available at the conference.  n/a",INFORMATION PROCESSING IN MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE,6231502,R13RR015416,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomechanics', ' cardiovascular disorder', ' computer data analysis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' functional /structural genomics', ' image processing', ' informatics', ' mathematics', ' meeting /conference /symposium', ' neoplasm /cancer', ' nervous system disorder', ' orthopedics']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS,R13,2001,5000,0.0048912654322715516
"METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF TAGGED MR CARDIAC IMAGES DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract):  The aim of this proposal       is to further develop and validate algorithms for analysis of SPAMM MR           cardiac images based on novel spline methods.  MRI is unique in its ability      to non-invasively and selectively alter tissue magnetization, and create         tagged patterns within the deforming tissue such as the heart muscle.  The       resulting pattern defines a time-varying curvilinear coordinate system on        the underlying tissue, allowing for precise and quantitative measurement of      tissue motion and deformation.  The investigators are developing two             frameworks for analysis of SPAMM tagged images, both of these aimed at           providing a more automated and reproducible approach to analysis of SPAMM        data, as well as providing dense 3-D displacement information at all points      within the LV myocardium.  The investigators propose to (a) further develop      and extend our analyses techniques.  The extensions considered will all be       related and based on currently developed computer vision-based techniques        for regional LV wall motion analysis, that operates either on a sequence of      SA slice stacks or on a time sequence of single slice.  (b) The                  investigators will validate the motion tracking methods by comparing ""true""      and algorithm-estimated motion trajectories:  1) on dense field of points        derived from 3-D tagged computer models of objects that simulate the moving      LV, 2) on dense field of points derived from Finite Element Model                simulations of the constitutive equations of LV deformations (once again tag     planes will be superimposed on the time course of simulated geometries), 3)      on selected points in the LV myocardium of the in vivo heart using a porcine     model.  Here, ""true"" motion will be determined by tracking implanted image       distinguishable markers.  (c) The investigators will test whether regions of     postmortem myocardial injury imply similar-sized and locate regions of           altered deformations (as measured by parameters developed in (a)).  The          algorithm-derived LV function assessment based on the analysis of in vivo        tagged MRI sequences will be compared with postmortem myocardial injury          assessment determined by myocardial staining techniques.  The validated          parameters will also be use to examine the time-course of change in the          ischemic areas of the chronic animal models.                                      n/a",METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF TAGGED MR CARDIAC IMAGES,6389619,R01HL057628,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cardiography', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer simulation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' heart motion', ' histopathology', ' human subject', ' image processing', ' magnetic resonance imaging', ' myocardial ischemia /hypoxia', ' swine']",NHLBI,BARNES-JEWISH HOSPITAL,R01,2001,122402,0.02154193176838281

"IMAGE PATTERN BASED WAVELET COMPRESSION FOR RADIOLOGY DESCRIPTION:  The research and development of teleradiology and telemedicine     systems has progressed through many technical and clinical endeavors.  When      dealing with large volume image transmission and storage, image data             compression is an outstanding issue in medical applications to which current     techniques were not designed to address.  The technical objectives of this       project are to develop optimized error-free as well as error-controllable        methods for medical image compression based on wavelet transform and             associated methods.  In this project, we employ both advanced artificial         intelligent and compression techniques to achieve these goals.                                                                                                    Our recent research outcomes include:  (a) development of a mathematics          approach to unify prediction, subband, and wavelet transforms, (b)               development of convolution neural network training methods to obtain             optimized wavelet kernel, (c) development of a data splitting technique to       improve edge accuracy and to provide error-control methods, and (d)              development of an integer implementation method for all wavelet transforms,      etc.  Based on the above technical advances, we propose to use integer form      of an adaptive (optimized) wavelets in conjunction with newly developed          coding methods such as ""partitioning in hierarchical trees"" (PHT) for            lossless compression.  For error-controllable approaches, we propose to use      adaptive wavelets coupled with optimized neural network prediction methods       in this study.  Since lossless compression is a part of the error -              controllable method, both systems can be implemented in the same scheme          which is a breakthrough approach in the field.  We will compare the              compression results (i.e., compression ratio and speed) of the proposed          compression methods with those of the current wavelet techniques using the       embedded zero-tree coding method.  At the end of the project, we will            deliver a software package for the radiological society.  Hence, the             evaluation for various clinical applications using the proposed methods can      be performed by the investigators.                                                                                                                                As the field of telemedicine is rapidly growing, we believe that development     of a dedicated compression module for economical storage and fast                communication of patient data (particularly for patient images) is               necessary.  This project is designed to address the related technical issues     with a strong clinical consideration.                                             n/a",IMAGE PATTERN BASED WAVELET COMPRESSION FOR RADIOLOGY,6173899,R01CA079139,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' charge coupled device camera', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' digital imaging', ' human data', ' image processing', ' radiology', ' telemedicine']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,176034,-0.003914930328885432
"DEVELOPMENT OF A KNOWLEDGE-BASED IMAGE REPORTING SYSTEM We have constructed a prototype structured reporting system that replaces conventional dictation and transcription for medical image reporting. Key design features include reporting speed, generation of graphical reports, structured storage of imaging findings, and the use of existing lexicons. Pilot timing data suggest that a radiologist using our system can generate a report more rapidly than with conventional reporting methods or speech recognition systems. Support is sought to refine the prototype, and to conduct feasibility testing. The specific aims are (1) to augment and refine a hierarchical test lexicon of imaging terms (2) to develop methods for the representation and reporting of imaging findings and their logical relationships, (3) to evaluate the system's performance on clinical imaging reports, and (4) to assess the completeness of existing lexicons for imaging. The project is supported by a Technical Advisory Committee comprised of experts in key methodological areas. A successful Phase I will lead (in Phase II) to testing of the approach for cross-sectional imaging, to adoption, augmentation, and use of an existing lexicon, to construction of real-time decision support techniques based on the knowledge base of imaging findings generated by the system, and to system evaluation in a clinical setting. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Our structured reporting system is appealing to radiologists because it speeds up the reporting process compared to conventional dictation/transcription or speech recognition. In addition, the system eliminates the costs, delays, inaccuracies, and other organizational problems associated with transcription services, thereby improving patient care. Therefore, time-efficient, speech-augmented structured reporting systems will likely capture a significant segment of the $1.2 billion annual market for radiology transcription services.  n/a",DEVELOPMENT OF A KNOWLEDGE-BASED IMAGE REPORTING SYSTEM,6073984,R43LM006837,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' information systems', ' vocabulary', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,"EDICT SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2000,98563,-0.009988207570143274
"WAVELET ENHANCEMENT OF CHROMOSOME BANDING PATTERNS This project aims to develop and commercialize significantly improved software for digital enhancement of the detail of chromosome banding patterns in microscopic images. These investigators have developed an innovative technique for this application, based upon wavelet transforms and multiresolution image analysis. Used with modern computerized chromosome analysis the proposed technique promises significantly improved enhancement of chromosome banding patterns and more effective visual detection of subtle rearrangements. This will help clinicians and researchers detect previously invisible or sub-visible band pattern alterations in conventional and high resolution banding. It will significantly increase the ability of automated instruments to assist the evaluation of chromosome alterations in clinical samples and in normal and neoplastic mammalian cells. During Phase I we implemented and tested three wavelet transforms with desirable mathematical properties. We developed a prototype multiresolution image processing system for chromosome enhancement. We obtained extremely encouraging results, strongly suggesting that these techniques offer considerably improved enhancement capability over conventional methods. and clearly demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. In Phase II we will complete the implementation and refinement of the software. We will implement several wavelet design approaches and evaluate many wavelet transform basis function sets that potentially can bring out relevant detail in chromosome banding patterns.

COMPUTER AIDED CARDIAC MEASUREMENT The objective of the proposed research is to develop a method for providing fast and accurate measurements of volume and ejection fraction from 3D echo images. Our Computer Aided Measurement System will reconstruct the LV endocardium using a few user selected points on oriented echocardiographic images together with prior shape and size knowledge. The Specific Aims for Phase I are: 1. To improve the accuracy of quantitative echo while minimizing manual labor. 2. To improve the ease of use of the prototype system for application in a clinical setting. 3. To expand the catalog representing our knowledge base by acquiring additional large volume and abnormally shaped LV's in order to enhance fitting accuracy for atypical shapes. Previously described methods of analyzing echocardiograms in 3D require so much manual labor that this modality has been limited to research applications. The advantages of our proposed approach are that it makes the superior accuracy and reproducibility of 3D echo available for clinical practice. Furthermore this process will be applicable to other imaging modalities. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This research will lead to products which can be sold to echocardiography system manufacturers and end users.

(b) The                  investigators will validate the motion tracking methods by comparing ""true""      and algorithm-estimated motion trajectories:  1) on dense field of points        derived from 3-D tagged computer models of objects that simulate the moving      LV, 2) on dense field of points derived from Finite Element Model                simulations of the constitutive equations of LV deformations (once again tag     planes will be superimposed on the time course of simulated geometries), 3)      on selected points in the LV myocardium of the in vivo heart using a porcine     model.  Here, ""true"" motion will be determined by tracking implanted image       distinguishable markers.  (c) The investigators will test whether regions of     postmortem myocardial injury imply similar-sized and locate regions of           altered deformations (as measured by parameters developed in (a)).  The          algorithm-derived LV function assessment based on the analysis of in vivo        tagged MRI sequences will be compared with postmortem myocardial injury          assessment determined by myocardial staining techniques.

"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features. The training and pilot data will be necessary for Dr. Dreizin’s long- term goal of research independence and R01 support to develop automated segmentation algorithms for the spectrum of clinically important imaging features after pelvic trauma, as well as fully automated multivariable clinical prediction tools with potential for translation to industry and as an FDA-cleared product. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement. We propose to develop automated software for hemorrhage-detection, and real-time risk prediction software for major arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures.",Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures,9955253,K08EB027141,"['Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arterial Injury', 'Award', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Caliber', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Crush Injury', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Extravasation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maryland', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability Theory', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shorthand', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Vehicle crash', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'artificial neural network', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer infrastructure', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'fall injury', 'hemodynamics', 'heuristics', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle form', 'neural network architecture', 'outcome prediction', 'pelvis fracture', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'radiologist', 'random forest', 'real time model', 'secondary outcome', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'support vector machine', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K08,2020,186183,0.011130654121666365
"Can machines be trusted? Robustification of deep learning for medical imaging Machine learning algorithms have become increasing popular in medical imaging, where highly functional algorithms have been trained to recognize patterns or features within image data sets and perform clinically relevant tasks such as tumor segmentation and disease diagnosis. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, by leveraging massive datasets and immense computing power to extract features from data. Deep learning is ideally suited for problems in medical imaging, and has enjoyed success in diverse tasks such as segmenting cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues. However, research in machine learning has also shown that deep learning is fragile in the sense that carefully designed perturbations to an image can cause the algorithm to fail. These perturbations can be designed to be imperceptible by humans, so that a trained radiologist would not make the same mistakes. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation, it is therefore crucial to develop a better understanding of the performance of neural networks. Specifically, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data. The goal of this project is to explore these questions in the context of medical imaging—to better identify strengths, weaknesses, and failure points of deep learning algorithms. We posit that malicious perturbations, of the type studied in theoretical machine learning, may not be representative of the sort of noise encountered in medical images. Although noise is inevitable in a physical system, the noise arising from sources such as subject motion, operator error, or instrument malfunction may have less deleterious effects on a deep learning algorithm. We propose to characterize the effect of these perturbations on the performance of deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we will study the effect of random labeling error introduced into the data set, as might arise due to honest human error. We will also develop new methods for making deep learning algorithms more robust to the types of clinically relevant perturbations described above. In summary, although the susceptibility of neural networks to small errors in the inputs is widely recognized in the deep learning community, our work will investigate these general phenomena in the specific case of medical imaging tasks, and also conduct the first study of average-case errors that could realistically arise in clinical studies. Furthermore, we will produce novel recommendations for how to quantify and improve the resiliency of deep learning approaches in medical imaging. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning by achieving superhuman performance on many tasks. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation in assisting radiologists for tasks such as segmentation of cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data.

"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,9913520,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biopsy', 'Breast biopsy', 'Bypass', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interventional Ultrasonography', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver diseases', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Needles', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'North America', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readability', 'Resolution', 'Retroperitoneal Space', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgical Instruments', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fetal', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,235027,0.013606083772774813
"Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence Summary / Abstract Objective — The goal of this proposal is to develop and optimize novel deep learning (DL) assisted approaches to improve diagnosis and clinical decision-making for congenital heart disease (CHD). This will be achieved by using DL, machine learning (ML), and related methods to extract diagnosis, biometric characterizations, and other information from fetal ultrasound imaging. Notably, this work includes a clinical translational evaluation of these methods in a population-wide imaging collection spanning two decades, tens of thousands of patients, and several clinical centers. Background — Despite clear and numerous benefits to prenatal detection of CHD and an ability for fetal ultrasound to detect over 90% of CHD lesions in theory, in practice the fetal CHD detection rate is closer to 50%. Prior literature suggests a key cause of this startling diagnosis gap is suboptimal acquisition and interpretation of fetal heart images. DL is a novel data science technique that is proving excellent at pattern recognition in images. DL models are a function of the design and tuning of a neural network architecture, and the curation and processing of the image data used to train the network. Preliminary Studies — We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts in echocardiography and CHD (Drs. Grady, Levine, and Arnaout), DL and data science (Drs. Keiser, Butte and Arnaout), and statistics and clinical research (Drs. Arnaout and Grady) and secured access to tens of thousands of multicenter (UCSF and six other centers), multimodal fetal imaging studies. We have created a scalable image processing pipeline to transform clinical studies into image data ready for computing. We have designed and trained DL models to find key cardiac views in fetal ultrasound, calculate standard and advanced fetal cardiac biometrics from those views, and distinguish between normal hearts and certain CHD lesions. Hypothesis — While DL is powerful, much work is still needed to adapt it for clinical imaging and to translate it toward clinically relevant performance in patient populations. We hypothesize that an integrated ensemble DL/ML approach can lead to vast improvements in fetal CHD diagnosis. Aims — To this end, the main Aims of this proposal are (1) to develop and optimize neural network architectures and efficient data inputs to relieve key performance bottlenecks for DL in fetal CHD; and (2) to deploy DL models population-wide to evaluate their ability to improve diagnosis, biometric characterization, and precision phenotyping over the current standard of care. Our methods include DL/ML algorithms and retrospective imaging analysis. Environment and Impact — This work will be supported in an outstanding environment for research at the crossroads of data science, cardiovascular and fetal imaging, and translational informatics. The work proposed will provide valuable tools and insight into designing and evaluating both the data and the algorithms for DL on imaging for clinically relevant goals, and will lay important groundwork for DL-assisted phenotyping for both clinical use and precision medicine research. Project Narrative Medical imaging is critical to almost every type of diagnostic and management decision, but human interpretation of medical images can lack accuracy and reproducibility. By developing machine learning methods for analyzing medical images, the work in our proposal can improve diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging, for both clinical and research uses.",Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence,9867431,R01HL150394,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Apical', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Heart', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computerized data processing', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'data curation', 'data harmonization', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease diagnosis', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'heart imaging', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning network', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repaired', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,806128,0.012742023174177162
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility.

As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR.

"TOPIC 389 - INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING Besides surgery, radiotherapy is the most effective treatment modality for localized prostate cancer. The success of radiotherapy stems from the exploit of a therapeutic window in tumor response and normal tissue tolerance which maximizes the chance of sterilizing the tumor while sparing the surrounding normal tissue from severe damage. This requires an accurate and individualized radiation dose distribution generated from the examination of the patient’s medical images. Radiation therapy is technically complex and labor intensive. Intensive human supervision and intervention are needed throughout the path of patient care.   Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are adept at automating workflows and tasks—in this case the development of cancer treatment plans. We believe that this machine learning has incredible potential to address inherent problems in the existing treatment planning workflow. Our approach will mitigate the current issues with treatment planning, integrate seamlessly with day-to-day operations, and will serve as a treatment solution that benefits patients in a way that limits their risk and extends their lives.   The goal of this project is to develop a start-to-end prostate cancer treatment planning system. We will work with three expert radiation oncology teams to archive existing patient data for use in training of artificial intelligence algorithms. These algorithms will enable high quality plans to be generated with ease. At the completion of Phase I, we will have a prototype interface that will allow users to create treatment plans and segmentation using artificial intelligence algorithms. Additionally, users will be able to evaluate these plans against other expert plans and against the training data. n/a",TOPIC 389 - INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING,10196876,5N91019C00053,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Patient', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Pythons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'data reduction', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'intelligent algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'web interface']",NCI,"RADIASOFT, LLC",N43,2020,55000,-0.02057146205024231
"Artificial Intelligence for Assessment of Stargardt Macular Atrophy Project Abstract Stargardt disease is the most frequent form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a widely available imaging technique which may aid in the diagnosis of Stargardt disease and is commonly used to monitor its progression. FAF imaging provides an in vivo assay of the retinal layers, but is only an indirect measure. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), in contrast, provides three-dimensional visualization of the retinal microstructure, thereby allowing it to be assessed directly and individually in eyes with Stargardt disease. At a retinal disease endpoints meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November of 2016, a reliable measure of the anatomic status of the integrity of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the retina, was proposed to be a potential suitable regulatory endpoint for therapeutic intervention clinical trials. Manual segmentation/identification of the EZ band, particularly in 3-D OCT images, has proven to be extremely tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. Automated objective segmentation techniques, such as an approach using a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct, would be of significant value. Moreover, Stargardt disease may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials. Thus, this proposal develops an AI-based approach for automated Stargardt atrophy segmentation and the prediction of atrophy progression in FAF and OCT images. More specifically, we first register the longitudinal FAF and OCT enface images respectively, and register the cross-sectional FAF to OCT image. We then develop a 2-D approach for Stargardt atrophy segmentation from FAF images using an AI approach and a 3-D approach for EZ band segmentation from OCT images using a 3-D graph-based approach. Finally, an AI-based approach is developed to predict subsequent development of new Stargardt atrophy or progression of existing atrophy from the OCT EZ band thickness and intensity features of the current patient visit. Project Narrative Stargardt disease is an inherited juvenile-onset macular dystrophy that may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults, thereby causing enormous morbidity with economic, psychological, emotional, and social implications. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials.

"Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning Project Summary Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in approximately a third of all MRI scans. The unique relaxation parameters of GBCAs create indispensable image contrast for a wide range of clinical applications, such as angiography and tumor detection. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF can be painful, cause severe disability, and even death. The risk of developing NSF prevents millions of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams. The recent identification of gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised additional safety concerns about the usage of GBCAs. Studies have demonstrated increased signal intensity on the unenhanced T1-weighted MR images that is correlated with previous GBCA exposure, and this gadolinium retention is independent of renal function. While initial reports focused on linear GBCAs, more recent reports show that gadolinium deposition occurs with macrocyclic GBCAs as well, albeit at lower levels. FDA has recently issued warnings about gadolinium retention following contrast-enhanced MRI, and required GBCA manufacturers to conduct human and animal studies to further assess the safety of these contrast agents. This project addresses these concerns by developing low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL). Approach: This fast-track project has two phases and three aims. Aim 1 (Phase I) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using pre-contrast images and contrast-enhanced images acquired with only 10% of standard GBCA dose. A software infrastructure will be constructed to seamlessly integrate the DL software between MR scanners and PACS. Aim 2 (Phase II) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using GBCA-free acquisitions with different image contrast. In Aim 3 (Phase II), we will clinically validate and evaluate both low-dose and zero-dose DL methods, including on patients with mild- to-moderate CKD. Non-inferiority tests and diagnostic performance of the synthesized full-dose images compared to the true full-dose images will be performed. Significance: This work will lead to safer contrast-enhanced MRI. The low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI method will benefit not only millions of patients with advanced CKD, who cannot currently undergo contrast-enhanced MRI, but many more patients with normal kidney function, who are at the risk of gadolinium retention after contrast-enhanced MRI. Project Narrative Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in MRI exams to create indispensable image contrast for monitoring treatment and investigating pathology and function. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, preventing patients with advanced chronic kidney disease from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams, as well as potential gadolinium deposition in the body and brain for patients with normal kidney function.

"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9997914,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,498014,0.04103053945066021
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,9853761,R01CA218187,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'PSA level', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,671823,-0.011500104716954888
"Automatic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers ABSTRACT As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention, which is critical in reducing long term toxicity of cancers. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to organs-at-risk (OARs), OARs need to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans during radiation treatment planning to get an accurate dose distribution. Despite tremendous effort in developing semi- or fully-automatic segmentation solutions, current automated segmentation software, mostly using the atlas-based methods, has not yet reached the level of accuracy and robustness required for clinical usage. Therefore, in current practice, significant manual efforts are still required in the OAR segmentation process. Manual contouring suffers from inter- and intra-observer variability, as well as institutional variability where different sites adopt distinct contouring atlases and labeling criteria, thus leading to inaccuracy and variability in OAR segmentation. When OARs are very close to the treatment target, segmentation errors as small as a few millimeters can have a statistically significant impact on dosimetry distribution and outcome. In addition, it is also costly and time consuming as it can take 1-2 hours of a clinicians’ time to segment major thoracic organs due to the large number of axial slices required. In summary, an accurate and fast process for segmenting OARs in treatment planning using CT scans is needed for improving patient outcomes and reducing the cost of radiation therapy of cancers. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning methods has revolutionized many computer-vision areas and the adoption of deep learning in medical applications has shown great success. Based on a deep-learning-based algorithm we developed that achieved better-than-human performance and ranked 1st in 2017 American Association of Physicist in Medicine Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge, an automatic OAR segmentation product will be developed in this project with the three aims: 1) further improve the performance and robustness of OAR segmentation algorithms, focusing on addressing the heterogeneity issue of different clinical environments; 2) further enrich the functionalities and enhance usability of the cloud- based software product; and 3) perform clinical validation study on the algorithm performance and software usability at collaborating sites. With this product, the segmentation accuracy can be improved, leading to more robust treatment plans in protecting normal organs and improved long term patient outcome. The time and cost of radiation treatment planning can be greatly reduced, contributing to a more affordable cancer treatment and reduced healthcare burden. NARRATIVE As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to such organs-at-risk (OARs), they are required to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans. A deep-learning-based automatic OAR segmentation product developed in this project can improve the segmentation accuracy and reduce the time and cost of radiation treatment planning as compared with the current manual process, leading to improved long term patient outcome and reduced cancer treatment cost.",Automatic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers,10081752,R44CA254844,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Body Regions', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Cost', 'Update', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dosimetry', 'healthcare community', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'life-long learning', 'millimeter', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prototype', 'satisfaction', 'segmentation algorithm', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NCI,"CARINA MEDICAL, LLC",R44,2020,1000000,0.005642677986299057
"Cardiac CT Deblooming PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 Americans annu- ally2. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive method widely employed for diagnosis of CAD and planning therapeutic interventions. With the current CT technology, calcium blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment. Similarly, stent blooming artifacts lead to overestimation of in-stent restenosis. As a result, many coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scans are non-diagnostic and result in patients receiving costly and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) procedures.  Based on extensive feasibility results, the goal of this project is to use deep learning innovations to fundamen- tally eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware. A consortium between GE Re- search, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Weill Cornell Medicine will develop dedicated imaging protocols and machine learning methods to avoid or minimize blooming artifacts and evaluate the clinical impact of the proposed solutions. In Aim 1, the CT scan protocol will be optimized and paired with deep learning reconstruc- tion and post-processing algorithms to generate high-resolution CT images and prevent blooming artifacts. In Aim 2, image-domain and raw-data-domain deep learning processing algorithms will be developed to correct for residual blooming. After successful demonstration of the proposed methods on phantom scans and emulated clinical datasets, in Aim 3 the proposed CT methods will be clinically demonstrated and optimized based on 100 patients with coronary artery disease, using intravascular ultrasound as the ground-truth reference.  At the end of the project, we will have demonstrated and publicly disseminated a systematic methodology to essentially remove blooming artifacts in cardiac CT without a costly hardware upgrade. This will be another suc- cess of deep learning, enabling accurate coronary stenosis assessment and eliminating many unnecessary diag- nostic catheterizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment with cardiac CT, leading to un- necessary invasive coronary angiography procedures. The goal of this project is to eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware, but based on optimized scan protocols and deep-learning-based image reconstruction and post-processing techniques.

"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,10003010,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'prostate radiotherapy', 'random forest', 'segmentation algorithm', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,315338,0.0070953223505830785
"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,10193990,R33AR073552,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Models', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'automated segmentation', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R33,2020,403748,0.033304320246295406
"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET in PET/MR and target delineation in radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from MR-only data.

"Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy Project Summary/Abstract Diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) currently relies on a qualitative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and lacks standardization. This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9928429,R21EB026665,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Central cord canal structure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intelligence', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiculopathy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'segmentation algorithm', 'software infrastructure', 'theories', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment optimization', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2020,195000,0.02117424751134527
"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging.

"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current clinical image modalities can be utilized to develop patient-specific computational models to pre-operatively plan transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. However, the computational modeling and simulation processes are time-consuming, which limits clinical translatability. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop algorithms using machine learning techniques to rapidly process and predict TAVR computational simulation outcomes directly from clinical image data.",A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes,9973167,R01HL142036,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Extravasation', 'Feedback', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Valves', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Postoperative Period', 'Problem Sets', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Response Elements', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stents', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm training', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'calcification', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'population based', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'speech recognition', 'time resolved data', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual clinical trial']",NHLBI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,383601,0.009618845759383687
"Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images ABSTRACT The goal of this R03 Small Grant Program for NIDDK is to provide additional funding for Dr. Kline to expand upon his work on his K award and apply his expertise to new image acquisitions and problems related to renal imaging. Dr. Kline’s work has piqued the interest of many internal and external investigators and has led to recent collaborations with Drs. Rule, Denic, and Kim. Together with Dr. Erickson, this new research team has prepared this R03 proposal which takes advantage of the unique expertise of each team member. The focus of this proposal is to bridge the gap between microscopic observations and those assessable non-invasively by radiological imaging. To do this, we have established a unique dataset of renal CT imaging data and corresponding biopsy measured nephron densities. We have also generated a large database of gold-standard segmentation data of kidneys, cortical regions, and medullary pyramids. Using this existing data, we propose to: (i) develop tools for segmentation of kidneys, segmentation of individual medullary pyramids, and imputing missing parts of the kidneys outside of the imaged field-of-view in the CT image, and (ii) to establish imaging biomarkers of early CKD, and correlate macroscopic imaging findings to underlying microscopic structure. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic’s outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Aging Kidney Anatomy Study (PI: Rule), which led to the generation of this unique and well characterized dataset. Dr. Kline’s background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly well suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, near the end of this research project Dr. Kline will submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of renal imaging biomarkers. Obtaining this R03 Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline’s transition into a prosperous independent researcher focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. Narrative Non-invasive methods for characterizing micro-structural changes of the kidney during aging as well as in health and disease are currently not possible. This research program proposes to use our existing database of renal imaging and renal biopsy data to bridge the gap between macroscopic radiological findings on computed tomography images to those assessable in microscopic images of renal biopsies. This program will develop new automated methods for performing measurements on the images, as well as use machine/deep learning methods to search for new imaging biomarkers that relate to nephron density and size, as well as establish their usefulness for early chronic kidney disease detection and transplant planning.",Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images,10040835,R03DK125632,"['Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Albuminuria', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Award', 'Biopsy', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrons', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Stenosis', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Tubular formation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'density', 'early detection biomarkers', 'graft failure', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'learning strategy', 'living kidney donor', 'member', 'microscopic imaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technology', 'personalized decision', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'research clinical testing', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R03,2020,113350,0.016633667018179435

"Content-based MR-TRUS Fusion without Tracking There are about 3 million American men living with prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States. If the prostate cancer is caught early before it spreads to other parts of the body, by active monitoring or treatment, most men will not die from it. Nevertheless, 22% to 47% of the patients with negative biopsies but elevated prostate-specific antigen levels may still harbor malignant tumors, which can be life threatening and could have been missed by the commonly used ultrasound guided random biopsy. By contrast, fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted biopsies has shown to significantly improve the cancer detection rate. However, MR-TRUS fusion itself is very challenging due to the difficulties in directly registering images of these two very different modalities in different dimensions. To bypass the difficult registration problems, the existing fusion techniques require the use of specialized expensive and cumbersome hardware tracking devices, which increases cost and elongates procedures. More importantly, due to a number of factors such as patient movement, respiratory motion and ultrasound transducer pressure change, prostate motion can happen during a procedure and cause the images to be misaligned. Timely noticing and correcting such motion require great skill and knowledge of radiological imaging, where studies show a steep learning curve for mastering fusion systems. Failing in image registration and motion compensation renders the fusion guided biopsy performing no differently than random biopsy. To address the fundamental cause of the problems, the goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR- TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices. The proposed research is foundational for developing next generation of MR-TRUS fusion guidance systems for prostate biopsy to achieve robust performance with lower costs.

This project aims for directly fusing 2D TRUS frames with 3D MR volume by developing novel deep learning methods for image reconstruction and registration. The proposed methods are designed to exploit both population and patient specific imaging information to accurately align images.

"Content-based MR-TRUS Fusion without Tracking There are about 3 million American men living with prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States. If the prostate cancer is caught early before it spreads to other parts of the body, by active monitoring or treatment, most men will not die from it. Nevertheless, 22% to 47% of the patients with negative biopsies but elevated prostate-specific antigen levels may still harbor malignant tumors, which can be life threatening and could have been missed by the commonly used ultrasound guided random biopsy. By contrast, fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted biopsies has shown to significantly improve the cancer detection rate. However, MR-TRUS fusion itself is very challenging due to the difficulties in directly registering images of these two very different modalities in different dimensions. To bypass the difficult registration problems, the existing fusion techniques require the use of specialized expensive and cumbersome hardware tracking devices, which increases cost and elongates procedures. More importantly, due to a number of factors such as patient movement, respiratory motion and ultrasound transducer pressure change, prostate motion can happen during a procedure and cause the images to be misaligned. Timely noticing and correcting such motion require great skill and knowledge of radiological imaging, where studies show a steep learning curve for mastering fusion systems. Failing in image registration and motion compensation renders the fusion guided biopsy performing no differently than random biopsy. To address the fundamental cause of the problems, the goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR- TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices.

"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9886248,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,628575,0.03669852542048854
"Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT In the U.S., more than 600,000 knee osteoarthritis (OA)-related total knee joint replacement (TKR) cases are reported every year, exceeding $17 billion estimated direct costs annually. There is a growing need for disease- modifying therapies that prevent or delay the need for TKR. However, development of such therapies remains challenging due to the lack of objective and measurable OA biomarkers for disease progression. The course of the OA is highly variable between individuals and the OA progresses too slowly, making it difficult to identify sensitive OA biomarkers capable of capturing minor changes on the knee joint. This has slowed development of effective therapies and prevents physicians from providing the most effective advice about minimizing the need for TKR. In this project, our goal is to develop imaging biomarkers to monitor minor OA-related changes in knee joint health that lead to TKR. To achieve this goal, we will combine novel deep learning algorithms with clinical and imaging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The OAI dataset includes clinical data, biospecimens, radiographs, and magnetic resonance (MR) images collected over 8 years. The proposed project has three Specific Aims: (i) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from the bilateral posteroanterior fixed-flexion knee radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); (ii) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from structural and compositional MR images using 3D CNNs with RNNs combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); and (iii) to determine whether deep learning–based imaging biomarkers can act as surrogates to predict the OA progression using a subject cohort (n = 296) independent of the cohort used to identify imaging biomarkers. The proposed project will couple deep learning with diagnostic radiology to unveil key combinations of OA-relevant features directly from images with minimal user interaction. This will facilitate fast individualized assessment of OA progression using whole knee joint images directly. If successful, this study will bring new insights into the development of imaging biomarkers for OA progression and more broadly into our understanding and treatment of OA. The knowledge gained in this project will help to advance close monitoring of OA progression by opening new perspectives on the regions and parameters for potential inclusion in both intervention studies and clinical practice. NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disorder of joints and is the most common reason leading to total knee joint replacement. Our proposed study aims to develop a novel automated OA-relevant imaging biomarker identification system based on radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and deep learning methods to study knee OA progression. We will address whether combining deep learning algorithms with medical images will determine the key combinations of features relevant to knee OA that are required to accurately predict the OA progression outcome.",Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis,9970413,R01AR074453,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'tool']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,497020,0.019590816537610408
"Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI Summary/Abstract In the presence of diseases such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. However, while imaging methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can provide high quality images of the moving heart, conventional clinical quantitative analysis of cardiac function is largely limited to global function analysis of the left ventricle (LV), with only qualitative and subjective characterization of regional function. An obstacle to better quantification of regional function is the complex 3D structure and motion of the heart wall, which has typically necessitated time-consuming user-guided processing of the images to carry out the associated 3D-motion analysis.  Recent advances in machine-learning (ML) approaches for image analysis are promising as new means to speed up the processing of cardiac images, as well as to analyze the underlying regional motion patterns. However, current Deep ML (DML) approaches to image analysis largely function as “black boxes”, without clear indications of which features contribute most to the analysis results, thus limiting their clinical utility. In the initial funded period of this research project, we have been developing integrated approaches to the segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and analysis of CMR data, with application to the evaluation of cardiac dyssynchrony. Today, treatment of dyssynchrony in HF with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) leads to improvement in only ~2/3 patients selected with conventional criteria (usually by electrocardiogram [ECG]). Our initial results show encouraging results of correlation between MRI evaluation of dyssynchrony and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) outcomes. In the new proposed research, we will further develop these methods, with the goal of automating the cardiac analysis methods. This will include the introduction of new ML-based methods, which will incorporate information on the specific cardiac motion factors that lead to classification of different disease states in dyssynchrony. Our Hypothesis is that by using these new ML-based methods for cardiac motion analysis, we will discover and evaluate significant quantitative correlations between different cardiac dyssynchrony motion patterns and CRT outcomes. Also, late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) provides images for infarction visualization. Incorporation of tissue characterization into the motion-pattern analysis could lead to increased understanding of how infarcted areas affect regional motion in concert with dyssynchrony. The unearthing of these findings will allow us to validate them in future clinical studies. The project will also disseminate our novel, coupled DML and model-based methodology for quantifying and classifying cardiac motion in diseases affecting regional wall motion. Other research groups can then apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases affecting LV motion. Project Narrative A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), as the current clinical selection criteria do not take into account regional cardiac function. We will develop improved methods for 4D-analysis and -visualization of both global and regional cardiac function from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data, including novel deep learning methods that will provide additional information on the salient features that contribute most to characterization of cardiac dyssynchrony. These new methods will be applied to the analysis of CMR data from both a stratified sample of normal subjects and patients with cardiac dyssynchrony (with and without infarction), with correlation with therapeutic results following CRT, potentially leading to improved clinical guidelines and clinical outcomes, as well as increased understanding of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.",Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI,10052934,R01HL127661,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pump', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Selection Criteria', 'Speed', 'Sweden', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'Width', 'base', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2020,763531,0.021045645647916274
"Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning Project Summary Positron-emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality that allows clinicians and researchers to study the physiological or pathological processes of the human body, and in particular the brain via the use of specific tracers. For brain PET imaging, patient head movement during scanning presents a challenge for accurate PET image reconstruction and subsequent quantitative analysis. Problems due to head motion are exacerbated by the long duration of the scans, with scan times commonly over one hour. Furthermore, some PET studies specifically involve subjects that either have trouble staying still due to psychological variations, e.g. patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, or psychological variations, e.g. subjects with anxiety disorders, or are required to participate in tasks that involve movement, e.g. smoking cigarettes while scanning. In brain scans, the average head motion can vary from 7 mm in clinical scans to triple this amount for longer research scans. Quantitatively, a 5 mm head motion can produce biases of up to ~35% in regional intensities and ∼15% in volume of distribution estimates, which could much larger than the difference observed in regional intensities or binding potential that distinguish different demographic groups being studied. The ability to track and correct head motion, therefore, would be of high utility in both clinical and research PET studies. In the past, many motion correction methods have been proposed. However, except for hardware-based approaches, there has been no method that can track frequent head motion on-the-fly during the PET acquisition. Hardware-based approaches are not readily available for clinical translation or used by other research facilities due to highly-customized software/hardware setup. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a data-driven methodology using deep learning to track and estimate rigid head motion using PET raw data, and incorporate both tracer type and time as conditional variables into this deep neural network design in order to handle diverse PET tracer types and their dynamic behavior. Overall, these solutions will provide for a data-driven motion estimation methodology to improve the quality of PET imaging. Specifically, we will start with the development and testing of our methodology for rigid head motion estimation using single-tracer PET raw data. Then we will perform evaluation of our multi-tracer motion estimation methodology applied to real PET data with a diverse range of tracers. Finally, in the exploratory phase, we will integrate time-of-flight information into deep learning-based motion prediction. The significance of this proposal is that it will allow for improved quality of PET imaging in real time and potentially allow for its use in clinical PET systems that do not have special motion tracking hardware. This work will serve as a first step towards developing data-driven motion estimation algorithms for full body PET imaging. The innovation lies in the development of what is a data-driven solution to the problem of real time motion estimation. Project Narrative Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain is a highly useful tool for biomedical research and clinical practice. Head motion during scanning degrades PET image quality and introduces image artifacts. We propose to develop new data-driven methods, based on PET raw data, to estimate head motion using deep learning, which can be used for real time motion estimation in PET imaging.",Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning,9877261,R21EB028954,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological Processes', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Smoking', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neural network', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'research facility', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,243150,0.039891173195836606
"Task-aware and Autonomous Robotic C-arm Servoing for Flouroscopy-guided Interventions Project Summary Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is used in more than 17 million procedures across the US and constitutes the state-of-care for various percutaneous procedures, including internal ﬁxation of pelvic ring injuries. To infer procedural progress from 2D radiographs, well-deﬁned views onto anatomy must be achieved and restored multiple times during surgery. This process, known as ”ﬂuoro hunting”, is associated with 4.7 s of excessive ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm position (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), yielding radiographs that are never interpreted clinically, but drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical staff.  Our long-term project goal is to use concepts from machine learning and active vision to develop task-aware algorithms for autonomous robotic C-arm servoing that interpret intra-operative radiographs and autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to acquire ﬂuoroscopic images that are optimal for inference. We have three speciﬁc aims: 1) Detecting unfavorable K-wire trajectories from monoplane ﬂuoroscopy images: We will extend a physics-based sim- ulation framework for ﬂuoroscopy from CT that enables fast generation of structured and realistic radiographs documenting procedural progress. Based on this data, we will train a state-of-the-art convolutional neural net- work that interprets ﬂuoroscopic images to infer procedural progress. 2) Developing and validating a task-aware imaging system in silico: Using the autonomous interpretation tools and simulation pipeline available through Aim 1, we will train an artiﬁcial agent based on reinforcement learning and active vision. This agent will be capable of analyzing intra-operative ﬂuoroscopic images to autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to yield task- optimal views onto anatomy. 3) Demonstrating feasibility of our task-aware imaging concept ex vivo: Our third aim will establish task-aware C-arm imaging in controlled clinical environments. We will attempt internal ﬁxation of anterior pelvic ring fractures and our task-aware artiﬁcial agent will interpret intra-operatively acquired ra- diographs to infer procedural progress and suggest optimal C-arm poses that will be realized manually with an optically-tracked mobile C-arm system.  This work combines the expertise of a computer scientist, a surgical robotics expert, and an orthopedic trauma surgeon to explore the untapped, understudied area of autonomous imaging enabled by advances in machine learning in ﬂuoroscopy-guided procedures. This development has only recently been made feasible by innovations in fast ﬂuoroscopy simulation from CT to provide structured data for training that is sufﬁciently realistic to warrant generalization to clinical data. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to investigate autonomous and task-aware C-arm imaging systems, paving the way for a new paradigm in medical image acquisition, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients by task-oriented image acquisition on a patient-speciﬁc basis. Subsequent R01 funding will customize this concept to other high-volume procedures, such as vertebroplasty. Project Narrative Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is the state-of-care for percutaneous fracture ﬁxation, and requires surgeons to achieve and reproduce well deﬁned views onto anatomy to infer procedural progress. This requirement alone is estimated to contribute 4.7 s of ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm repositioning (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical team.

"Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before heart attacks occur and is currently used to predict risk in millions of patients annually. Under the current grant, we have established a unique collaborative multicenter registry including over 23,000 imaging datasets (REFINE SPECT) with both prognostic (major adverse cardiovascular events) and diagnostic (invasive catheterization) outcomes. Using this registry, we have demonstrated that a combination of MPS image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools achieved superior predictive performance compared to visual assessment by experienced readers or current state-of-the-art quantitative techniques. In the renewal, we plan to expand REFINE SPECT with now-available enhanced datasets (adding CT and myocardial blood flow information) and leverage latest AI advances to provide a personalized decision support tool for patient-specific cardiovascular risk assessment and estimation of benefit from revascularization following MPS. The overall aim is to optimize the clinical capabilities of MPS in risk prediction and treatment guidance by integrating all available imaging and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI methods. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To expand and enhance our REFINE SPECT registry including CT and MPS flow data, (2) To develop fully automated techniques for all MPS and CT image analysis, (3) To apply explainable deep learning time-to-event AI models for optimal prediction of MACE and benefit from revascularization from all image and clinical data. This work will result in an immediately deployable clinical tool, which will optimally predict risk of adverse events and establish the relative benefits from specific therapies, beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of all imaging (MPS, CT, flow), and clinical data by physicians. Such quantitative integrative methods are not yet available, leaving the current practice for assessing risk and recommending therapy highly subjective. The precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians in easy to understand terms (e.g., % risk per year, or relative risk of one therapy vs. the alternative) for a specific patient. Additionally, our methods to make AI conclusions more tangible will improve adoption of this technology. All results will be derived fully automatically thus eliminating any variability. Our approach will fit into current MPS practice and will be immediately translatable to clinics worldwide. Most importantly, this research will allow patients to benefit from increased precision and accuracy in risk assessment, thereby optimizing the use of imaging in guiding patient management decisions and ultimately improving outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT is often used to predict who is at risk of heart attack and should undergo treatment such as coronary bypass or stenting; however, physicians read images visually and report results with wide variability. With the latest artificial intelligence tools and new types of imaging (including CT and fast SPECT scans), the investigators propose to develop and validate an automated clinical tool to optimize risk prediction and objectively establish the relative benefit of a specific therapy. This new tool will consider all available patient images and other relevant information to provide a personalized explanation and precise calculation of risk and potential benefits from therapy for each patient.",Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT,9888240,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Country', 'Cox Models', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'International', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stents', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse event risk', 'attenuation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic', 'radiotracer', 'relating to nervous system', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,808131,0.010559844109142819
"Machine learning for fast motion compensated quantitative abdominal DCE-MRI Project Summary: Functional imaging with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) provides important physiological markers of permeability, perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a measure of kidney function, without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. DCE-MR images are at the same time used for evaluation of anatomy. Functional markers from DCE-MRI, if computed accurately, would play a critical role in diagnosing and assessing the progression of a number of pediatric diseases including those compromising kidney function, liver diseases, tumors, and Crohn's disease. One of the most important applications of DCE-MRI is assessing kidney function (GFR) in hydronephrosis patients with obstruction. In the absence of GFR information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgical reconstruction might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment, and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., “watchful waiting”) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information, it is slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. There is a clinical need for accurate computation of quantitative functional markers. Unfortunately, current methods of DCE-MRI in neonates and children are less than optimal, and therefore, DCE-MRI is underutilized in clinical practice. The technical challenges include insufficient temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function (AIF) dynamics (which are required for accurate computation of quantitative markers), unavoidable respiratory motion and bulk motion (which reduce image quality and significantly lower the accuracy of parameter estimates), and a lack of robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate computation of markers. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI method addressing these challenges. The primary objective of this exploratory, three-year study, is three-fold: first, to develop and evaluate a new bulk and respiratory motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI technique for accurate estimation of functional markers; second, to further improve the robustness and speed of DCE-MRI using a fast, deep learning (DL) technique with integrated temporal prior for the reconstruction of motion-compensated, higher quality, high temporal resolution images; and third, to develop an automatic quantitative analysis pipeline including segmentation and tracer kinetic model-fitting using DL techniques for fast, robust and accurate quantification of functional markers. The successful completion of these aims will provide new, clinically important abdominal imaging capabilities, with real-time, motion-compensated image reconstruction and reliable real-time parameter estimation from high temporal and spatial resolution DCE-MRI. This work will extend the usefulness of DCE-MRI to pediatric patients who are unable to remain still in the scanner, and eliminate the need for repeated scans and sedation in infants. ! ! Project Narrative: This project addresses the need to develop advanced methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide new, clinically important abdominal imaging capabilities, with real-time, motion-compensated image reconstruction and reliable real-time estimation of clinically important quantitative imaging markers from high temporal and spatial resolution DCE-MRI.

"Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials Project Summary / Abstract In patients with lymphomas and other cancers, quantitative evaluation of the extent of tumor burden is im- portant for staging, restaging, and assessment of therapeutic response or relapse; yet measurement of overall tumor burden is challenging with current tools, particularly when lymph nodes are confluent or difficult to fully differentiate from surrounding structures. Precision medicine and novel therapeutics are emphasizing the need to introduce a risk-adapted approach to tailor appropriate treatment strategies for cancer patients. The ability to quantitatively assess cancer phenotypes with functional and anatomical imaging that could efficiently and ac- curately map patients to gene expression profiling, clinical information, matching cohorts, and novel treatment regimens could potentially result in more optimal management of patients with cancer.  This Academic-Industry Partnership aims to translate recently developed technologies for semi- automated image segmentation and quantification of lymph nodes into robust tools and integrate them into an existing cloud-based system for management of multicenter oncology clinical trials. The ability to semi- automatically segment lymph node pathology with computed tomography (CT), as well as quantify nodal me- tabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) will enable comprehensive tracking of morphological and functional changes related to disease progression and treatment response.  Since 2004, the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center's (DF/HCC) Tumor Imaging Metrics Core (TIMC) has developed the Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC (PIM) platform to manage clinical trial image assessment workflows. Currently, there are nearly 50,000 consistently measured lymph node measurements in the TIMC database. The PIM system is used to make over 20,000 time point imaging assessments per year at eight NCI- designated Cancer Centers and aims to grow quickly by transitioning to a fully cloud-hosted system.  Given sufficient training data, state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technolo- gies can meet or even exceed human performance on specific imaging analysis tasks. Recent studies have indicated that AI-based lymph node segmentation from CT scans is nearing human performance levels, and we will extend and translate this work into a commercial tool. Specifically, our aim is to translate recent ad- vancements in AI-based segmentation into deployable services, and integrate these services into the clinical trial workflow. The proposed system will be designed to incorporate expert feedback provided by image ana- lysts and radiologists back into the ground truth dataset, allowing for continuous improvement in accuracy and clinical acceptance. We will extend our semi-automatic CT segmentation technologies to quantify lymph node metabolism in PET/CT, using lymphoma as the model disease. Integration of these technologies with PIM will provide an ongoing source of consistently measured quantitative data across a network of cancer centers. Project Narrative Advanced quantitative imaging is underutilized in oncologic clinical practice and research because the time investment entailed in manual lesion segmentation remains prohibitive. This partnership proposes to integrate machine learning based quantitative imaging tools into the existing Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC clinical trial image management system. We will use data from the centralized Tumor Imaging Metrics Core at the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center to produce ground truth training data and develop semi-automated multimodali- ty lesion analysis for patients with cancer.",Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials,10003193,R01CA235589,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Goals', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'NCI-Designated Cancer Center', 'Nodal', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Services', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Burden', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'glucose metabolism', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'lymph nodes', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'success', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,607952,-0.03556445386695065
"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives. Project Narrative Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides which currently available solutions do not overcome.

"Computer Vision-Based Navigation System for High-Precision Orthopedic Trauma Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Closed or open fracture reduction and internal fixation is the standard surgical approach in treating pelvic fractures, with current clinical practice using fluoroscopic guidance, guidewire insertion, and cannulated screw placement. The challenge in reckoning complex 3D morphology in 2D fluoroscopy presents a major source of uncertainty, trial-and- error, and poor outcomes, with 20-30% rate of suboptimal screw placement and long fluoroscopic runtime (mean fluoro time > 123 s) exposing operating personnel to high levels of radiation exposure. Despite these challenges, mainstream surgical approach has remained largely unchanged for 35 years, and surgical navigation systems (though increasingly common in neurosurgery) present cost and workflow barriers that limit their broad applicability in trauma surgery. We propose a computer vision-based navigation approach that is compatible with routine trauma surgery workflow, offers real-time guidance with accuracy comparable to stereotactic navigation, gives ten-fold reduction in radiation exposure, and works with tools already common in the trauma surgery arsenal. The proposed system uses a miniature stereoscopic camera mounted onboard the surgical drill in combination with 3D-2D registration of fluoroscopic views for direct, real-time registration of the instrument trajectory relative to patient anatomy. Real-time overlay of instrument trajectory in fluoroscopic views and/or CT permits accurate identification of guidewire entry point, orientation, and conformance within bone corridors and will reduce reliance on “fluoro hunting” and trial-and-error guidewire placement. The following aims develop and evaluate the system for application in pelvic trauma surgery, including quantitative assessment of accuracy, workflow, and radiation dose in pre-clinical studies. Aim 1. System for computer vision-based guidance in trauma surgery. The hardware and software components required for vision-based tracking onboard a standard surgical drill will be developed, providing real-time trajectory overlay in fluoroscopy and/or preoperative CT. A fast calibration method will be developed for automatic drill axis calibration. Automatic feature-based registration of the video and fluoroscopic frames enables real-time overlay of instrument trajectory in fluoroscopic views (Fluoro Navigation), and 3D-2D registration between CT and fluoroscopy will enable real-time overlay of the instrument trajectory in CT (CT Navigation). Aim 2: Evaluation in preclinical studies. The vision-based navigation system will be implemented in pre-clinical (cadaver) experiments to evaluate accuracy and workflow. These studies will evaluate the geometric accuracy and workflow factors relating to the number of repeated insertion attempts, procedure time, and radiation dose, evaluating vision-based Fluoro Navigation and CT Navigation in comparison to conventional freehand fluoroscopy guidance. Successful completion of the aims will establish a system suitable for computer vision-based navigation to be translated to clinical studies in future work. Such a system offers a potentially major advance in routine trauma surgery, bringing capabilities comparable to state-of-the-art stereotactic navigation without the cost, complexity, and additional workflow of conventional navigation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even experienced trauma surgeons are challenged in resolving the complex 3D morphology of the pelvis in 2D x-ray fluoroscopy, presenting a major source of uncertainty, a high rate of malpositioned screws, and high levels of radiation exposure to the patient and operating staff. To facilitate high-precision pelvic trauma surgery and reduce intraoperative radiation dose, we propose a computer vision-based navigation approach providing real-time overlay of surgical instrument trajectories in fluoroscopic views and CT, facilitating accurate identification of guidewire entry point, orientation, and conformance within safe bone corridors. The approach offers a major advance compared to conventional navigation by not requiring intraoperative 3D imaging, avoiding time-consuming calibration, and eliminating externally-positioned hardware in the operating room, and the proposed research translates the system from basic development and quantitative testing to preclinical studies evaluating geometric accuracy, workflow, and radiation dose.",Computer Vision-Based Navigation System for High-Precision Orthopedic Trauma Surgery,10005337,R21EB028330,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Calibration', 'Clinical Research', 'Closed Fractures', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Mainstreaming', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Navigation System', 'Needles', 'Open Fractures', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Instruments', 'System', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Uncertainty', 'Visceral', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mortality', 'neurosurgery', 'neurovascular', 'pelvis fracture', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'sample fixation', 'socioeconomics', 'stereoscopic', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,204688,0.018048485323555213
"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",9936447,R01EB028591,"['Affect', 'Alkalies', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Uric Acid', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcium phosphate', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'prevent', 'risk minimization', 'statistical learning', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,357486,0.01883942481457002
"Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is widely used to detect and evaluate coronary artery disease. The goal of this project is to reduce the radiation dose and/or scan time of SPECT MPI by a combined factor of 16x, while maintaining or increasing diagnostic accuracy. This would enable SPECT MPI to be performed, e.g., with 4x reduced radiation dose and 4x shorter scan time (~2.5 minutes) than typical protocols. Radiation dose in SPECT MPI has been recognized as an important issue, accounting for ~25% of all radiation exposure to patients in medical imaging. Dose reduction particularly addresses the increased prevalence of obese patients (who receive higher dose) and younger cardiac patients (whose radiation risk is higher due to longer life expectancy). Reduction in scan time would improve comfort for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating body-motion image artifacts and reducing healthcare costs by increasing clinical throughput. We will reduce dose and scan time through innovative image reconstruction methods that involve little or no cost and require no additional patient setup steps. We will employ new respiratory and cardiac motion compensation to reduce image artifacts, as well as new deep learning techniques, which will be used for both respiratory-signal estimation and high-performance denoising. We will methodically optimize these techniques and then validate our algorithms in multicenter clinical reader studies. SA1: Develop clinically practical respiratory motion surrogates for low-count studies. T1: Perfect data- driven respiratory surrogate estimation; T2: Optimize data-driven surrogate estimation at reduced counts; T3: Develop and clinically validate depth-sensing cameras for respiratory and body-motion surrogate estimation; T4: Generalization of data-driven surrogate estimation to SPECT systems not having a CT. SA2: Develop deep-learning reconstruction methods and optimize for diagnostic accuracy and dose/scan time. T1: Post-reconstruction DL denoising algorithms for 3D perfusion images for reduced-count and standard- count studies; T2: DL denoising algorithms for 4D cardiac-gated studies; T3: 4D reconstruction with embedded DL denoising, cardiac motion estimation and correction; and T4: DL reconstruction methods with both RMC and CMC, with projection data binned using respiratory surrogate signals derived in SA1. SA3: Perform multicenter clinical reader studies (6 clinicians, 3 institutions) to validate the new algorithms and compare to current clinically-available methods based on diagnostic performance and repeatability in assessing both perfusion and wall motion defects. T1: In comparison to baseline clinical reconstruction, evaluate added benefit of: a) including attenuation and scatter correction, and b) additionally including RMC; T2: Validate DL for improvement of perfusion and function (wall motion) task performance at full-count levels; and T3: Validate DL for improvement of task performance at reduced counts. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will employ new methods of image reconstruction and processing to reduce radiation dose and scan time in cardiac SPECT imaging, which is used 15-20 million times per year to evaluate coronary artery disease. Dose reduction is important because cardiac SPECT accounts for ~25% of all radiation exposure to the public due to medical imaging; reducing scan time would make SPECT more comfortable for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating image artifacts, as well as and reducing healthcare costs by allowing more patients to be scanned per day. Our goal will be to achieve a combined 16x reduction in dose and scan time while maintaining or improving diagnostic accuracy, thereby permitting a 4x reduction in dose while reducing scan time from ~10 minutes to ~2.5 minutes.","Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning",10072432,R01HL154687,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Exposure to', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institution', 'Left Ventricular Function', 'Life Expectancy', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'heart motion', 'hemodynamics', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'prognostic', 'quantum', 'radiation risk', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,786840,0.03537915953409874
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9989025,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,612684,-0.013932404141745075
"Machine learning accelerated on-line adaptive replanning Abstract. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and test a novel machine learning (ML) accelerated On-Line Adaptive Replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided radiation therapy (RT) (MRgRT). During the multi-fraction RT process, the location, shape and size of tumors and normal organs vary significantly between the fractions. These interfraction variations are among the major factors that can limit the accuracy of RT targeting. The current standard practice of image-guided RT (IGRT), developed to address the interfraction variations based on cone-beam CT (CBCT), can only correct for translational errors, and thus does not fully account for interfraction changes. To address this issue, researchers recently introduced online adaptive replanning (OLAR) that generates a new plan based on the anatomy of the day and delivers the plan for the fraction. Currently, two main obstacles affect the success of OLAR: (1) the anatomy of the day cannot be delineated accurately based on CBCT, and (2) the time required to perform OLAR is long enough to render it impractical. One way to improve the delineation accuracy is to use MRI versus CT. MRI-guided OLAR is currently being introduced into the clinics to substantially improve RT targeting. However, the bottleneck is still the impractical length of time required to segment the anatomy of the day, which can exceed 30 minutes. Furthermore, available synthetic CT (sCT) generation methods are slow or inaccurate for MRI-guided OLAR. There is no method available to quickly and objective determine when OLAR is necessary. To address these issues, we plan to develop novel techniques in the MOLAR solution. We hypothesize that the MRI-based MOLAR solution will fully account for interfraction changes, thereby substantially improving tumor targeting during RT delivery and the effectiveness of RT. Specifically, we aim to (1) develop practical ML-based solutions to quickly determine the necessity of OLAR and to rapidly generate accurate synthetic CTs; (2) develop ML-based techniques to substantially accelerate segmentation for OLAR using a progressive three-step process; and (3) verify clinical practicality and effectiveness of MOLAR by retrospectively and prospectively applying the MOLAR on MRI sets to test its speed and effectiveness in accounting for interfraction variations. We will develop this novel MOLAR solution by forging unique collaborations between clinical physicists, radiation oncologists and industry developers via an established academic-industry partnership. The successful completion of this project will enable clinicians to routinely practice “image-plan-treat”, which is the optimal solution for MRgRT. This new paradigm will fully account for interfraction variations, improve tumor targeting, reduce normal tissue toxicity, and ultimately encourage clinicians to revise the current doses and/or dose fractionations to increase therapeutic gain, enhance patient quality of life, and/or substantially save on healthcare costs. Our proposed strategy represents a drastic departure from current practice. We firmly believe that this strategy is the future of RT delivery. Project Narrative: This R01 application proposes to develop and test a novel machine learning accelerated online adaptive replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided adaptive radiation therapy through a unique academic and industry partnership. The MOLAR solution aims to fully account for interfraction variations, thereby substantially improving the accuracy and effectiveness of radiation therapy (RT) for cancer. This solution will enable clinicians to routinely practice “image-plan-treat”, a drastic departure from current practice and representing the future of RT delivery.",Machine learning accelerated on-line adaptive replanning,9941621,R01CA247960,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Anatomy', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electron Transport', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Variant', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'convolutional neural network', 'electron density', 'forging', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'pancreatic cancer patients', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'quantitative imaging', 'routine practice', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R01,2020,517299,-0.010939454926338256
"2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging SUMMARY This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging, a three- day meeting to be held from February 25-27, 2021, which will be the seventh of its kind hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. The requested funds will primarily be used to cover travel and lodging for junior researchers who will be presenting at the workshop: undergraduate, graduate and junior faculty. Some funds may also be allocated to help pay for live webcasting and publication costs related to workshop materials. As with previous meetings, we intend to stream each session of the meeting in real-time, allowing those who are interested in the proceedings but unable to attend in person to access them online for free. As mortalities associated with pulmonary disease continue to rise worldwide, innovative imaging techniques capable of both diagnosing and helping to treat these pathologies are becoming an increasingly important. As a field, pulmonary imaging currently encompasses a wider range of techniques for the structural, functional and molecular assessment of lung disorders than at any time in its history. What is more, these techniques are being developed and optimized by researchers across an increasingly diverse set of fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, computer science and medicine. Given the field's rapidly-evolving nature, the existence of a regular forum in which scientists and clinicians can communicate their ideas with each other is of the utmost importance. Given the absence of other scientific meetings with a similarly focused agenda, our previous workshops have succeeded in providing just such a forum—allowing a diverse group of pulmonary imaging researchers to come together for the kind of rigorous, collaborative exchange that can continue to advance the field. The specific aims of the proposed workshop are as follows: (1) host a one-day workshop on pulmonary inflammation; (2) inform the pulmonary imaging community of the latest advances in structural, functional and molecular lung imaging; (3) explore the use of pulmonary imaging to evaluate therapeutic response, the inherent obstacles to doing so, and strategies to overcome them; (4) investigate new approaches for integrating deep learning and pulmonary imaging techniques to more accurately diagnose and phenotype disease and predict injury progression; (5) broadcast the entire workshop live online, thereby enabling interested parties not in attendance to access the proceedings in real-time, free of charge. Based on the uniformly positive feedback in response to our one-day boot camp on pulmonary physiology prior to the 2019 workshop, we intend to hold another boot camp before the 2021 meeting, this time focused on pulmonary inflammation. This boot camp will consist of ~5 longer presentations (approximately 1 hour each) on topics related to this central theme, with significant time devoted to question and answer after each, and a final discussion panel aimed at synthesizing the most important issues covered over the course of the day. In addition to this exciting addition to the format, the 2021 workshop will again seek a more equitable balance between functional, structural and molecular imaging approaches to pulmonary disease across the invited talks, while also continuing to expand our recent focus on the topics of imaging assessments of treatment response and the integration of imaging techniques with machine learning. Finally, the 2021 workshop add a session on bridging the gap between current clinical practice and innovative imaging technologies. NARRATIVE This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging at the University of Pennsylvania. This recurring workshop provides a necessary and valuable opportunity for researchers working in the fields of functional, structural, and molecular imaging technique development for assessing lung diseases such as lung cancer, COPD, IPF and ARDS to come together in order to discuss and share their work.

"An Integrated Software Platform for Accelerating Image-Driven Ophthalmic Research and Driving New Insights and Endpoints to the Clinic ABSTRACT More than 20 million patients suffer from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma. These degenerative eye diseases develop over decades, and their prevalence is increasing. Retinal imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography and adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy are essential tools in the investigation and management of eye disease. New quantitative biomarkers derived from these and other imaging modalities are critical to the clinical translation of emerging ophthalmic innovations. However, biomarker development in the era of artificial intelligence requires large volumes of annotated images and transparent, reproducible processes, which places new demands on the management of living subjects research, data sharing, and algorithm development. Unfortunately, current software platforms are not effective in integrating these data in a manner that meets specific requirements in ophthalmology, Our goal in this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR, consistent with objectives of the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science, is to create an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, analysis, and sharing of ocular images and data. We will extend the capabilities of systems developed by the Advanced Ocular Imaging Program (AOIP), Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), which include: (a) LATTICE - a software solution that reduces costs, reduces errors, and improves communications in the management of living-subjects research; (b) MOSAIC - an image processing platform and algorithm library with traditional and AI-trained algorithms; and (c) The AOIP Image Bank - a Repository that houses images and data on 1578 fully-consent human research subjects. To create the integrative platform, we will address four aims: (a) Extend LATTICE to meet the workflow requirements of academic and sponsored research in local and multisite environments, including the extensible direct integration of data relevant to ocular studies; (b) Design and implement a hybrid (local + cloud) REPOSITORY architecture, data schema, knowledge ontology, and query architecture for Owners and Readers of data.; (c) Integrate and demonstrate LATTICE, REPOSITORY and MOSAIC into a continuous ocular science workflow and (d) integrate and demonstrate Lattice, Repository and Mosaic into a continuous ocular science workflow. Our Integrated Translational Imaging platform will enable ophthalmic innovators to translate sight-saving insights and interventions to the clinic faster, with less frustration, and greater confidence. Our proposal fills an important technology gap in the field of ophthalmic data science and biomarker development. While the number and type of imaging devices continues to grow, the tools to develop and deploy new biomarkers and clinical endpoints using these exquisite imaging devices has not kept pace. With this program we will enable a new generation of image-driven innovation to find its way to the clinic. Project Narrative With more than 20 million patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma, it is crucial to develop non-invasive biomarkers as early predictors of eye disease and reliable tests of the safety and efficacy of new preventative and restorative therapies. To meet the unmet need for rapid access and analysis of ophthalmic research data for the discovery of these biomarkers, we will create an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, sharing, and analysis of ocular images and data. If we meet our objectives, our platform will reduce the cost of clinical research and increase the speed of translating critical research insights to saving the sight of millions of patients.",An Integrated Software Platform for Accelerating Image-Driven Ophthalmic Research and Driving New Insights and Endpoints to the Clinic,9908389,R44EY031198,"['Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Docking', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundations', 'Frustration', 'Funding', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Human Subject Research', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Mosaicism', 'Ontology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Wisconsin', 'adaptive optics', 'algorithm development', 'algorithm training', 'application programming interface', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fighting', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging program', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'microsystems', 'ocular imaging', 'process repeatability', 'programs', 'repository', 'retinal imaging', 'safety testing', 'software systems', 'structured data', 'tool', 'verification and validation', 'vision science']",NEI,"TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING INNOVATIONS, INC.",R44,2020,743347,0.000931013441723809
"Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment Abstract Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with preferential delivery of 90Y microspheres to target lesions has shown promising response rates with limited toxicity in the treatment of hepatocellular (HCC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the world. However, to achieve more durable responses, there is much room to improve/adapt the treatment to ensure that all lesions and lesion sub-regions receive adequate radiation delivery. While externally delivered stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well suited for smaller solitary HCC, its application for larger or multifocal disease is challenged by the radiation tolerance of the normal liver parenchyma. A dosimetry guided combined approach that exploits complementary advantages of internal and external radiation delivery can be expected to improve treatment of HCC. To make this transition, however, prospective clinical trials establishing safety are needed. Furthermore, for routine clinic use, accurate and fast voxel-level dose estimation in internal radionuclide therapy, that lags behind external beam therapy dosimetry, is still needed. Our long-term goal is to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy with personalized dosimetry guided treatment. Our objective in this application is to demonstrate that it is possible to use 90Y imaging based absorbed dose estimates after SIRT to safely deliver external radiation to target regions (voxels) that are predicted to be underdosed and to develop deep learning based tools to make voxel-level internal dose estimation practical for routine clinic use. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will perform a Phase 1 clinical trial in HCC patients where we will take the novel approach of using the 90Y PET/CT derived absorbed dose map after SIRT to deliver SBRT to tumor regions predicted to be underdosed based on previously established dose-response models. The primary objective of the trial is to obtain estimates of safety of combined SIRT+SBRT for future Phase II trial design. In parallel, in Aim 2, building on promising initial results we will develop novel deep learning based tools for 90Y PET/CT and SPECT/CT reconstruction, joint reconstruction-segmentation and scatter estimation under the low count-rate setting, typical for 90Y. These methods have a physics/mathematics foundation, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are included within the iterative reconstruction process, instead of post-reconstruction denoising. In Aim 3, we will develop a CNN for fast voxel-level dosimetry and combine with the CNNs of Aim 2 to develop an innovative end-to-end framework with unified dosimetry-task based training. At the end of this study, we will be ready to use the new deep learning tools in a Phase II trial to demonstrate enhanced efficacy with SIRT+SBRT compared with SIRT alone and advance towards our long- term goal. This will accelerate adoption of these next-generation tools in clinical practice and will have a significant positive impact because treatment based on patient specific dosimetry will substantially improve efficacy, compared with current standard practice in SIRT. Although we focus on 90Y SIRT, our tools will be applicable in radionuclide therapy in general, a rapidly advancing treatment option. Narrative We will perform a Phase I clinical trial where standard-of-care Y-90 microsphere radioembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma will be followed by external radiation to target regions that are predicted to be underdosed by Y-90, based on patient specific dosimetry. In parallel, we will develop and test voxel-level internal dosimetry tools using convolution neural networks to make such dosimetry-based planning accurate and fast for routine clinic use. This study is relevant to public health because a dosimetry-guided combination radiation treatment approach is likely to substantially improve patient outcome compared to current standard practice of internal or external radiation only.",Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment,10052989,R01EB022075,"['90Y', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Evaluable Disease', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver parenchyma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radioembolization', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'dosimetry', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'internal radiation', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'phase II trial', 'prospective', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,670584,-0.006085897710920473
"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource.

"IEEE Medical Imaging Conference Abstract  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) is the leading international scientific meeting bringing together a broad community interested in the physics, engineering and mathematical aspects of medical imaging, with special emphasis on nuclear medicine and multi-modal systems. The MIC runs in conjunction with the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) and the Workshop on Room Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors (RTSD).  The purpose of the MIC is to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. While the traditional topics of primary interest are related to nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), increasing space will be also given to recently evolving imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, optical, MR, with special emphasis on their multi-modal combination with nuclear medical imaging. Recently there has also been additional interest in employing deep learning and AI to enhance the field medical imaging. The conference provides a well-established forum of scientific exchange and dialogue between researchers in academia, industry, and government as well as education of the public, with special emphasis on young generations. This is reflected by the large spectrum of educational refresher sessions and short courses. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks $10,000 in funding for each of the next three years to provide 20 trainee grants of $500 each to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration, housing and/or short course fees for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions.  We anticipate that the main impact of this grant program will be to increase attendance of students and postdocs at the 2020 meeting, especially those typically underrepresented, as well as to support their participation in educational activities. It is important to bring young generations, especially women, minorities, and those with disabilities, into the medical imaging field, where they could become main actors in the coming years. They will attend plenary and oral presentations given by many of the world leaders in the nuclear medical imaging instrumentation, image processing, and quantitative analysis fields. Moreover, they will be given the unique opportunity of direct personal interaction through the short courses and dedicated poster presentations. In turn their work will be exposed to the other participants for critical evaluation, constructive suggestions and dissemination. Furthermore, many of these trainees will likely continue in this field, thereby contributing to advancing technology with high societal relevance as being increasingly used in the clinical management of disease and therapeutic interventions. Narrative  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) has the purpose to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. The conference covers a variety of medical imaging topics including quantitative imaging, PET/SPECT techniques, image reconstruction, imaging in radiation therapy, portable imaging, multi-modality systems, new medical imaging technologies, CT/MR/optical/ultrasound, parametric/kinetic image modeling, and signal/image processing and modeling.

"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,10016296,R21EB027241,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tissue biomarkers', 'white matter']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2020,252175,0.010786270583011006
"Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods Project Summary / Abstract  Hybrid PET/MRI systems are very advantageous for a variety of clinical applications by combining the soft tissue contrast of MRI with the functional and metabolic information of PET. These systems have found success for oncology studies, particularly in head and abdomen/pelvis, as well as for epilepsy, neurological diseases, heart disease, and pediatrics for dose reduction. However, the PET resolution and SNR is typically worse than MRI, and suffers from the loss of feature and data due to motion as well. PET/MRI systems offer the potential to create more accurate, higher resolution PET reconstructions, including correction of artifacts, motion, and im- proved localization, by performing synergistic reconstructions that leverage the simultaneous data acquisition. In particular, this fellowship proposes to develop novel physics-constrained machine learning models for informa- tion sharing between PET and MRI for enhanced spatial localization, estimation of attenuation and activity, and motion. We propose to develop a deep maximum-likelihood estimation of attenuation and activity (MLAA) that can compensate for artifacts and improve PET reconstruction accuracy. We also propose a motion-enhanced joint PET/MRI reconstruction to capture arbitrary motions and reduce dose requirements for chest and abdomen studies. Together, these models aim to improve the PET spatio-temporal resolution, SNR, and quantiﬁcation for a broad range of clinical applications, and will be evaluated for cancer assessment in the pelvis, liver, and lung.  This fellowship will be performed in the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at UCSF under the guidance of Prof. Peder Larson, who leads a research program on advanced imaging methods development, and Dr. Thomas Hope, a radiologist and nuclear medicine physician who leads multiple PET/MRI projects. The Department is one of the leading centers in biomedical imaging research, and has been at the forefront on translating PET/MRI systems into clinical practice. The UCSF PET/MRI scanner has dedicated research time, which is also available on other MRI and PET/CT research systems, and extensive computational resources to support the proposed project. The applicant, Dr. Abhejit Rajagopal, has a background in computational imaging and machine learning, will be jointly mentored by this engineer/physician team. He will be trained to become a biomedical imaging scientist by participating in formal coursework on medical imaging systems, training on the PET/MRI system, grant writing, and performing clinical research, supporting his development into a creative, independent biomedical researcher. Project Narrative  Hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) imaging systems cur- rently aid in diagnosis and prognosis of numerous types of cancer and disease, but are not always precise enough to accurately measure and track a patient’s response to therapy, particularly in organs and tissue that are sub- ject to motion. There is an unrealized potential here to synergistically combine complimentary PET-MRI data to dramatically improve the spatial resolution and SNR of PET, as well as to create motion-resolved 4D (x,y,z,t) imagery by combining information across modalities and time-frames to combat severe undersampling. These methods will be evaluated in human studies of cancer to capture ﬁne structure and micro-features on moving organs (e.g. lung nodules, liver metastases), ultimately aiding in quantitative characterization of disease.",Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods,10069132,F32EB030411,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Chest', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Fellowship', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Implant', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Oncology', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Writing', 'attenuation', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'combat', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'imaging scientist', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'information model', 'lung imaging', 'method development', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'systems research', 'uptake']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,69426,0.04933230372349705
"An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System In this SBIR Phase IIb proposal Xoran intends to commercialize a compact and affordable, yet highly- functional, system to provide real time image updates and navigation guidance in support of minimally invasive cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures. The effort builds on previously developed compact and portable flat-panel Computed Tomography (CT) technology which has been commercialized for hard tissue applications, and incorporates work done in earlier phases of this project to generate viable high- quality images of the soft tissue structures in the brain. Intraoperatively obtained images tightly integrated into an onboard surgical navigation will provide updated instrument localization using next generation electromagnetic tool tip guidance. Workflow optimizations become possible when the imaging and guidance are one device, including fast local image updates, automatic image-to-world registration, as well as speed and simplicity of use. The project includes expansion of the system capabilities to facilitate precise minimally-invasive surgical removal of tumors in both the head and spine. It incorporates a machine-learning based deep neural network method for image finalization to allow high quality, low radiation image updates. The three-year project involves meeting technical milestones of system development including imaging capability, registration, navigation accuracy, speed, workflow, radiation dose considerations and cost. Clinical evaluations will take place at University of Michigan, and a team of consulting physicians has been assembled for oversight, input and feedback. Narrative / Relevance to Public Health Minimally invasive surgical procedures have many benefits to public health including reducing the medical risks and costs associated with brain cancer and spine surgery. However such procedures are often time consuming and technically difficult as the surgeon is unable to directly visualize the area of the operation. In this project, an intraoperative surgical system is developed with onboard imaging capability in order to enable minimally invasive surgeries to be performed more safely and completely, by providing hi-resolution imaging of the brain and spine while the surgeon operates.",An Integrated CT-based Image-Guided Neurosurgical System,10017876,R44CA112966,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Capital', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Consensus', 'Consult', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Michigan', 'Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures', 'Monitor', 'Navigation System', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Neurosurgical Procedures', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pituitary Neoplasms', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spine surgery', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vertebral column', 'Veterinary Medicine', 'Veterinary Schools', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer site', 'cancer surgery', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cranium', 'deep neural network', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'meetings', 'minimally invasive', 'neurosurgery', 'next generation', 'operation', 'point of care', 'portability', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'soft tissue', 'spine bone structure', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,"XORAN TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2020,1279629,0.016092339326057407
"Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. An estimated 3.8 million men and 3.4 million women die each year from CHD. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive imaging modality used for diagnosing CHD and for planning therapeutic interventions. Cardiac CT exams are still challenging to perform due to the beating heart and the need to carefully time the scan based on cardiac phase and based on when the peak iodine contrast enhancement is reached. The overall exam duration and the complexity of performing these exams (contrasted with limited reimbursement levels) have limited patient access to cardiac CT to academic hospitals and specialized cardiac imaging centers. As compared to other CT exams, cardiac CT exams require additional patient preparation time, additional CT scans to track the bolus, and additional contrast agent to avoid missing the peak enhancement.  The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. Initial results show that it is possible to extract cardiac gating information from a few CT projection measurements prior to the diagnostic CT scan, without reconstruction. This is made possible by an innovative combination of fast X-ray tube pulsing and deep learning raw data analysis. This project builds on GE Research's experience with cardiac CT technologies, deep learning algorithms and X-ray tube physics, as well as the strong clinical cardiac CT expertise at the University of California San Diego.  The outcome of this project will be a clinical feasibility study of the autonomous triggering approach, which has the potential to simplify and increase patient access to cardiac CT, while reducing exam time, reducing con- trast agent volume, and ensuring robust image quality. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. The result will be a patient-friendly and technologist-friendly cardiac CT exam with reduced exam time, minimal contrast agent volume and radia- tion dose, and robust image quality.",Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering,10029731,R01HL153250,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Bolus Infusion', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Iodine', 'Measurement', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preparation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'standard of care', 'temporal measurement', 'time interval']",NHLBI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,R01,2020,1060608,0.016156304907252818
"Optimizing Acquisition and Reconstruction of Under-sampled MRI for Signal Detection PROJECT SUMMARY Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a versatile imaging modality that suffers from slow acquisition times which is a challenge for both time sensitive applications and for patient throughput. Accelerating MRI would benefit patients both by reducing the time they need to be in the scanner and in reducing the cost of healthcare. This project is part of a larger scientific effort to accelerate MRI while maintaining the diagnostic quality. Acceleration, even by a factor of two would result in a major advance for public health. Two of the current approaches to accelerate MRI rely on collecting less data (under-sampling) and constrained or deep learning reconstruction. These approaches can lead to images with diagnostic quality with significant under-sampling but may suffer from artifacts which are hard to characterize. Specifically, this project will optimize the performance of constrained reconstruction and deep learning on detecting subtle lesions in acquiring and reconstructing under-sampled MRI. To carry out this optimization, we will first develop the methods required for detection of lesions by machine and human observer models. Then the models will be validated by psychophysical studies where humans perform the detection task. In the first aim of this project, we will optimize constrained reconstruction based on the ideal linear observer. We will consider under-sampled acquisition strategies in 2D MRI including one and two dimensional subsampling methods with constrained reconstruction using both wavelet and total variation constraints. We will perform simulations using anatomical backgrounds both for lesions which match the prior information of the constraints and those which do not to better understand how choices in acquisition and reconstruction affect ideal detection. While the ideal linear observer approximates the best possible detection, typically the signal detection is carried out by a human. In the second aim, we will optimize constrained reconstruction using human observer models and validate the models using human observer studies. A recent approach to reconstruction of under- sampled images is based on deep learning. In the third aim, this work will optimize deep learning reconstruction based on ideal and human observers. Due to the complexity of the deep learning approach, having this task-based approach to optimization is particularly relevant. This project will optimize a network using signal detection to better understand how training and architecture choices in the neural network affect detection of lesions which are not included in training images. This research project will help to strengthen the research environment at Manhattan College by involving students in biomedical research incorporating applied mathematics, statistics and data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a versatile imaging modality that suffers from slow acquisition times which is a challenge for both time sensitive applications and for patient throughput.

"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease.

"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them. Overall Project Narrative  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) develops novel imaging techniques and technologies for the improved diagnosis and management of cancer, musculoskeletal disease, neurological disease and other disorders with a profound impact on human health.

"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9926311,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,348620,-0.005516478173761378
"Deep LOGISMOS Abstract: This is a competitive continuation of a project that already yielded the highly flexible, accurate, and broadly applicable LOGISMOS framework for context-aware n-dimensional image segmentation. To substantially improve and extend its capability, we will develop Deep LOGISMOS that combines and reinforces the complementary advantages of LOGISMOS and deep learning (DL). There is growing need for quantitative failure-free 3D and higher-D image analysis for diagnostic and/or planning purposes. Examples of current use exist in radiation oncology, cardiology, ophthalmology and other areas of routine clinical medicine, many of which however still rely on manual slice-by-slice tracing. This manual nature of such analyses hinders their use in precision medicine. Deep LOGISMOS research proposed here will solve this problem and will offer routine efficient analysis of clinical images of analyzable quality. To stimulate a new phase of this research project, we hypothesize that: Advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms, when combined with deep-learning-derived application/modality specific parameters and allowing highly efficient expert-analyst guidance working in concert with the segmentation algorithms, will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired, complex, diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. The proposed research focuses on establishing an image segmentation and analysis framework combining the strengths of LOGISMOS and DL, developing a new way to efficiently generate training data necessary for learning from examples, forming a failure-free strategy for 3D, 4D, and generally n-D quantitative medical image analysis, and discovering ways for automated segmentation quality control. We will fulfill these specific aims:  1. Develop an efficient approach for building large segmentation training datasets in 3D, 4D, n-D  using assisted and suggestive annotations.  2. Develop Deep LOGISMOS, combining two well-established algorithmic strategies – deep learning  and LOGISMOS graph search.  3. Develop and validate methods employing deep learning for quality control of Deep LOGISMOS.  4. In healthcare-relevant applications, demonstrate that Deep LOGISMOS improves segmentation  performance in comparison with state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. Deep LOGISMOS will bring broadly available routine quantification of clinical images, positively impacting the role of reliable image-based information in tomorrow’s precision medicine. Narrative: Previous phases of this successful research project were devoted to the development of new graph-based methods for multi-surface and/or multi-object multi-dimensional biomedical image segmentation. Deep learning is emerging as an important new way to learn from large sets of examples. This proposal will combine deep learning and graph-based image analysis to maximize their combined strengths and overcome their individual weaknesses with the overarching goal to facilitate routine use of quantitative medical image analysis techniques in personalized medical care.",Deep LOGISMOS,10016301,R01EB004640,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fundus photography', 'Generations', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Ophthalmology', 'Organ', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Slice', 'Stroke', 'Suggestion', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Tissue', 'adjudication', 'automated analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'diabetic', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'macular edema', 'n-dimensional', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'success', 'task analysis', 'treatment planning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,396286,-0.003302716694305508
"mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II 1 Project Summary NIH is increasing its investment in large, multi-center brain MRI studies via projects such as the recently announced BRAIN initiative. The success of these studies depends on the quality of MRIs and the resulting image measurements, regardless of sample size. Even though quality control of MRIs and corresponding measurements could be outsourced, most neuroscience studies rely on in-house procedures that combine automatically generated scores with manually guided checks, such as visual inspection. Implementing these procedures typically requires combining several software systems. For example, the NIH NIAAA- and BD2K- funded Data Analysis Resource (DAR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) uses XNAT to consolidate the structural, diffusion, and functional MRIs acquired across five sites, and has also developed their own custom software package to comply with study requirements for a multi-tier, quality control (QC) workflow. However, these custom, one-off tools lack support for the multi-site QC workflows that will come with the unified platform that MIQA represents: a design that supports collaboration and sharing, and strong cohesion between technologies. To improve the effectiveness of QC efforts specific to multi-center neuroimaging studies, we will develop a widely accessible and broadly compatible software platform that simplifies the creation of custom QC workflows in compliance with study requirements, provides core functionality for performing QC of medical images, and automatically generates documentation compliant with the FAIR principle, i.e., making scientific results findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  Specifically, our multi-site, web-based software platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by leveraging open-source, state-of-the-art web interface technologies, such as a web-based dataset caching system and machine learning to aid in QC processes. Users will be able to configure workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of medical imaging studies but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans. Issue tracking technology will enhance communication between geographically-distributed team members, as they can easily share image annotations and receive automated notifications of outstanding QC issues. The system will be easy to deploy as it will be able to interface with various imaging storage backends, such as local file systems and XNAT. While parts of this functionality have been developed elsewhere, MIQA is unique as it provides a unified, standard interface for efficient QC setup, maintenance, and review for projects analyzing multiple, independently managed data sources.  The usefulness of this unique QC system will be demonstrated on increasing the efficiency of the diverse QC team of the multi-center NCANDA study. Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop a web-based, multi-site, open-source platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) to address the QC needs of geographically diverse teams using small and large medical image-based studies alike. MIQA will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by levering state-of-the-art machine learning, data management, and web interface technologies. Our effort will minimize the time spent on labor-intensive reviews and analysis operations by supporting team-oriented reviewing that is guided by highly customizable workflows seamlessly interacting with existing data management systems.",mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II,10010814,R44MH119022,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Alcohols', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'FAIR principles', 'Four-dimensional', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Iowa', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'Writing', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dexterity', 'image archival system', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'open source', 'operation', 'quality assurance', 'research study', 'software systems', 'success', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'web interface']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R44,2020,819293,0.0077071878682634645
"Super-multiplexed fluorescence nanoscopy for imaging-based proteomics PROJECT SUMMARY In situ immunofluorescence imaging is a powerful method to study the locations, expression levels and structures of proteins in cells and tissues. In particular, multiplexed imaging reveals the interaction networks of proteins, which allows us to understand the underlying mechanisms of many diseases. However, it has been challenging to perform multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging due to its extremely time-consuming process, high cost and lack of signal amplification. The limited spatial resolution achievable with confocal microscopy often fails to reveal complex spatial organization and to determine localizations of proteins. Here we propose super-multiplexed immunofluorescence nanoscopy that is capable of imaging more than twenty different proteins in 24 hours with nanoscale resolution. We will employ DNA-barcoded secondary nanobodies that are monovalent, open-source and designed for quantitative labeling. Repeated introduction and washing of fluorescent DNA imagers will generate highly multiplexed images. Moreover, we will develop unprecedentedly fast stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy that employs a parallelized line array of doughnut beams. It will feature a large imaging area and excellent optical sectioning capability. Photon reassignment, hyperspectral imaging and deep-learning will further facilitate rapid super-resolution-based protein profiling. Our new biochemical and optical tools will play crucial roles in diverse biomedical areas including brain proteomics and cancer profiling. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop highly multiplexed immunofluorescence super-resolution imaging tools.

"Next-Generation Ultrasound Localization Microscopy Project Summary/Abstract Abnormal alterations of tissue microcirculation are often associated with early stage of tissue pathology. Detection and characterization of these early microvascular abnormalities can greatly benefit clinical diagnosis and treatment monitoring as well as facilitating the creation of new therapies to counter disease development. For decades, there has been a longstanding quest for the development of a clinical imaging modality that can noninvasively and directly image such tissue microvascular variations. To date, however, such an imaging method remains elusive due to the fundamental compromise between imaging spatial resolution and depth penetration. Therefore, the long-term objective of this project is to fulfill this unmet clinical need by developing the next-generation ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM), which is an ultrasound-based imaging technique that can directly assess structural and functional tissue microvasculature in vivo in humans at a clinically relevant depth. Different from other imaging modalities, ULM is not limited by the resolution-penetration compromise: ULM can noninvasively image capillary-scale microvessels at several centimeters depth and quantitatively measure their blood flow speed (as low as 1 mm/s). Such combination of deep imaging penetration and exquisite spatial resolution and the unique functionality of measuring small vessel blood flow speed make ULM a promising technique for many clinical applications including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. At present, however, ULM is not ready for clinical use due to several key technical limitations: 1) ULM data acquisition is very slow (tens of seconds with breath holding); 2) ULM post-processing is very expensive computationally (several hours to generate a single 2D ULM image); 3) ULM is difficult to be extended to 3D imaging (which is important for comprehensive evaluation of tissue microvasculature such as in cancer applications). These limitations largely forbids ULM from being effectively used in the clinic to provide useful microvascular biomarkers. In this proposal, we will concentrate on addressing these technical barriers and transform ULM to a truly useful clinical imaging tool. Our approach synergistically combines deep learning (DL), parallel computing, and ultrafast 3D ultrasound imaging to fundamentally shorten ULM data acquisition time, substantially accelerate ULM post-processing, and enhance ULM to 3D imaging. Our first aim will develop and validate DL-based ULM data processing algorithms that would enable real-time 4D morphometric ULM and fast 3D quantitative ULM. Our method uniquely collects real labeled optical imaging data on a chicken embryo microvessel model for DL training. Our second aim will focus on realizing 3D-ULM on a 2D row-column-addressing transducer with ultrafast 3D plane wave imaging. We will develop a DL-based beamforming technique to enable high-fidelity 3D microbubble imaging for robust 3D-ULM. Our final aim will focus on validating the in vivo performance of the newly developed 3D-ULM imaging techniques on a mouse tumor model. We will be collaborating with world-renowned experts in deep learning, optical imaging, and comparative medicine at the University of Illinois to accomplish these aims of the proposal. Project Narrative Imaging-based detection and characterization of abnormal tissue microvascular variations is clinically significant for diagnosis, treatment evaluation, and therapy development in many pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. At present, there is no viable noninvasive imaging tool that can fulfill this important clinical need. To fill this gap, we propose to develop a new ultrasound-based super-resolution microvessel imaging technique that can directly and quantitatively assess the structure and the function of tissue microcirculation in vivo in humans.",Next-Generation Ultrasound Localization Microscopy,10039725,R21EB030072,"['3-Dimensional', '3D ultrasound', '4T1', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chickens', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incentives', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbubbles', 'Microcirculation', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Organ', 'Oxygen', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Transportation', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'microscopic imaging', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optical imaging', 'parallel computer', 'performance tests', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'real-time images', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'two photon microscopy']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,565346,0.02400105341651932
"Automated Treatment Planning for High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Cervical cancer affects approximately 7.4/100,000 women in the US with minority women being disproportionally affected. High dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy is an effective treatment modality by irradiating the tumor from inside while simultaneously sparing dose to nearby organs. Multiple randomized trials revealed that including HDR brachytherapy in cervical cancer radiotherapy increases overall survival rates from 46.2% to 58.2%. Yet HDR brachytherapy has seen a downward trend in its use, with complex treatment planning process being one of the major reasons, causing a 13% reduction in cause-specific survival rate. For HDR brachytherapy, the planning has to be accomplished in a very short period of time to reduce patient discomfort and patient motion during the planning process, which could causes substantial deviation of planning geometry from delivery geometry (1.5mm motion leads to >10% change in dose). At present, it takes on average 135 min to manually generate a treatment plan. Due to the time pressure, suboptimal plans are often generated. D2cc, the dosimetric quantity correlated to organ toxicity could be further reduced up to 8.4%, corresponding to 5.1% reduction of complication rate. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a fully automated treatment planning process to reduce planning time, improve plan quality and therefore outcome, reduce patient discomfort, and most significantly, to promote the use of HDR brachytherapy. Our group has successfully developed and clinically implemented the AutoBrachy system, an automatic planning tool that generates a patient-generic plan in 3 minutes. However, automatic organ segmentation and physician-oriented treatment planning are missing, preventing a fully automated process to generate the patient-specific optimal plan. Current practice relies on human expertise to solve the two problems, taking up to 90 min for segmentation and 30 min for planner and physician to finalize plan. Given the recent advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in mimicking humans to achieve human-level performance, we believe that AI can be used to empower AutoBrachy to achieve a fully automated planning process. The overall goal of this fellowship project is to develop AI-based organ segmentation and human-like treatment planning modules in AutoBrachy, and to validate the system in real patient cases. We will pursue two specific aims (SAs): SA1: System development. Create an automatic organ segmentation module and a human-like automatic planning module. SA2: System validation. Perform a retrospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of the developments. The innovation is the use of state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve critical problems in HDR brachytherapy. This project is logically built on the candidate’s engineering background and medical physics training. It targets at a disease that is highly significant to the underserved population, for which the candidate is highly motivated to solve. The project also fits perfectly with the candidate's long-term career goal of establishing a high-quality independent research program to develop state-of-the-art treatment methods for cancer radiotherapy. NARRATIVE This project will develop and validate artificial intelligence based computational modules for automatic organ segmentation and human-like treatment planning to achieve a fully automated and streamlined treatment planning process for high-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is a severe disease, particularly affecting underserved population who typically present at advanced stages. The developed tools will lead to clinical benefits to patients by improving plan quality, planning efficiency, and patient comfort, as well as will reduce the technical burden of high-dose-rate brachytherapy and therefore promote the use of this effective therapeutic modality to yield broad impacts.",Automated Treatment Planning for High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer,9991582,F31CA243504,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bladder', 'Brachytherapy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Fellowship', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy', 'Human', 'Institution', 'International', 'Irradiated tumor', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rectum', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sigmoid colon', 'Small Intestines', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Underserved Population', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend', 'tumor']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2020,34644,-0.0013534268155928762
"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice. There is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour organs at risk in medical images at a high degree of automation for impacting current practice of radiation therapy planning. Encouraged by strong competitive results from the Phase I part of this project, in this grant, further technical advances and a cloud-based software service are proposed. A multicenter clinical evaluation of the new product is also planned to assess the clinical efficacy of the system.",Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning,10241562,R42CA199735,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Blinded', 'Body Regions', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Object Attachment', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'software as a service', 'software development', 'software systems', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'virtual']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R42,2020,2500,0.015127382893758772
"Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an invaluable tool for studying the early development of the brain and can resolve diagnostic ambiguities that may remain after routine ultrasound exams. Unfortunately, high levels of fetal and maternal motion (1) limit fetal MRI to rapid two-dimensional (2D) sequences and frequently introduce dramatic artifacts such as (2) image misorientation relative to the standard sagittal, coronal, axial planes needed for clinical assessment and (3) partial to complete signal loss. These factors lead to the inefficient practice of repeating ~30 s stack-of-slices acquisitions until motion-free images have been obtained. Throughout the session, technologists manually adjust the orientation of scans in response to motion, and about 38% of datasets are typically discarded. Thus, subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of MRI for answering clinical and investigational questions in the fetus. The overarching goal of this project is to overcome the challenges posed by motion by exploiting innovations in deep learning, which have enabled image-analysis algorithms with unprecedented speed and reliability. We propose to integrate these into the MRI acquisition pipeline to unlock the potential of fetal MRI. We will develop practical pulse-sequence technology for automated and dynamically motion-corrected fetal neuroimaging without the need for external hardware or calibration. We hypothesize that this will radically improve the quality and success rates of clinical and research studies, while dramatically reducing patient discomfort and cost. We propose as Aim 1 to eradicate (2) the vulnerability of acquisitions to image-brain misorientation with rapid, automated prescription of standard anatomical planes. In Aim 2, we propose to address (3) motion during the scan with real-time correction of fetal-head motion. An anatomical stack-of-slices acquisition will be interleaved with volumetric navigators. These will be used to measure motion as it happens in the scanner and to adaptively update the slice tilt/position. We propose as Aim 3 to develop a 3D radial sequence and estimate motion between subsets of radial spokes for real-time self-navigation. Adaptively updating the orientation of spokes and selectively re-acquiring corrupted subsets at the end of the scan will enable 3D imaging of the fetal brain (1). Since the applicant has a physics background, the proposed training program at MIT and HMS will focus on deep learning and fetal development/neuroscience during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed for transitioning to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant’s goal is to become a fetal image acquisition and analysis scientist acting as bridge between deep learning, MRI and clinical fetal-imaging applications to shift the boundaries of what is currently possible with state-of-the-art technology. Fulfilling the research aims will promote this, as it will result in a practical framework for automation and motion correction, applicable to a wide variety of fetal neuroimaging sequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging, as it frequently produces images with dramatic artifacts. The goal of this project is to exploit innovations in deep learning and integrate them into the acquisition pipeline to overcome the challenges posed by motion in fetal neuroimaging studies. This will be achieved by using fast, automated scan prescription of standard anatomical planes and by adaptively updating the acquisition as motion happens in the scanner, based on sub-second navigator scans interleaved with the imaging sequence.",Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI,9950474,K99HD101553,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Calibration', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radial', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'echo detection', 'experience', 'fetal', 'image archival system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2020,108601,0.03307656551483164
"Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction Nuclear medicine imaging in children has been shown to have significant clinical value across all organ systems. In providing this significant benefit it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that of adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. The governing principle of this project will be to minimize radiation dose while methodically ensuring that lesion detection performance is fully preserved. This will be accomplished by using validations based on both numerical and physician observers measuring performance in tasks that emulate those performed clinically. We will employ two approaches in tandem to enable lowering dose while maintaining performance. First, we will use advanced image reconstruction and processing techniques. Corrections for various forms of image quality degradation will be incorporated in the reconstruction, and deep learning (DL) will be used for post-reconstruction denoising. Second, we will develop methods to correct for both body and respiratory motion, which degrade diagnostic accuracy. Correcting for body and respiratory motion will allow dose to be reduced without loss of image quality and will also offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to minimize motion when imaging children. For this investigation we have selected 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal imaging as a testbed to demonstrate our approaches. Damage to the renal cortex resulting from infection of the kidneys is a critical issue in children, including newborns and toddlers. DMSA SPECT is the “gold-standard” in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal scarring post- infection. The concepts we will demonstrate for reduction of radiation dose and correction of motion with DMSA will be translatable to other SPECT (and PET) studies in pediatric imaging and beyond.  Our Specific Aims are: 1. Establish infrastructure for investigating and evaluating advanced reconstruction and motion correction; 2. Determine the extent of radiation dose reduction to pediatric patients through improved reconstruction and DL denoising while maintaining optimal full-dose lesion detection accuracy; 3. Develop data-driven and depth-sensing camera methods for body and respiratory motion estimation and correction; and 4. Conduct numerical and physician observer studies to validate the level of dose reduction enabled by DL denoising and motion correction. Narrative  In nuclear medicine imaging, it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that in adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. Correcting for body and respiratory motion occurring during imaging will improve the quality of the formed three-dimensional images of the patient by reducing blurring and image artifacts and offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to reduce motion when imaging children, which can bear health risks of its own. We propose an advanced reconstruction methodology which would enable reduction in the amount of activity administered and compensate for patient motion during imaging.",Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction,9914572,R01EB029315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DMSA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Freedom', 'Gaussian model', 'General Anesthesia', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Newborn Infant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Pyelonephritis', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Study', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toddler', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney infection', 'molecular imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'renal scarring', 'respiratory', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,773763,0.03810074089554311
"Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality Over the past 15 years, new imaging technologies and methods for high throughput imaging have revolutionized structural biology by extending the resolution and scale of collected images in 3 dimensions. The resulting image volumes are more typically hundreds of GB to even tens of TB and in some cases approach PB sizes. These file sizes pose challenges for image acquisition, image analysis, and communication of a representative set of raw data and quantification. Image acquisition runs can be lengthy and expensive, and often errors are not identified until after the completion of scanning. Large files contain many structures, and require machine learning (ML) strategies in a context that permits error correction. Scientific communication requires tools for ready access to raw data, and more efficient methods to communicate the rapidly accumulating sets of scientific information. We propose to leverage virtual reality (VR) and verbal communication within the VR environment, to streamline each of these stages of scientific work, by capitalizing on the more natural abilities for stereoscopic vision and hearing to process scenes and language. Based upon the tool base and direct volume rendering of large files that we have established in our VR software, called syGlass, we will first integrate VR into the microscope controls for tuning the microscope and then efficiently inspecting images in 3D as they are acquired (Aim 1). Next, we will introduce novel domain adaptation techniques in the ML field to scale up 3D image quantification capabilities for current acquisition sizes, by coupling them with user-optimized experiences that do not require ML expertise, and yet provide automated and accurate results (Aim 2). Finally, we will provide tools to efficiently generate narrated scientific presentations in VR for use in the lab setting, as manuscript publications, and for production of educational materials (Aim 3). In each of these activities, we will introduce paradigm shifts in the management of experiments, analysis of the resulting data, and publication of manuscripts and materials to other scientists and the general public. The goal of this project is to speed the pipeline from image acquisition to communication of analyzed data for large image files (big data). We propose to leverage virtual reality to change the way users interact with their microscope, provide new methods for more accurate quantification and make scientific data more transparent, and more accessible to specialists and the general public. These new paradigms are applicable to basic, pre-clinical and clinical research, and serve the goals of big data projects to generate more reliable and encompassing scientific conclusions.","Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality",10011054,R44MH125238,"['3-Dimensional', '3D virtual reality', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Depth Perception', 'Educational Materials', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Distribution', 'Ingestion', 'Instruction', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Lasers', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Resort', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'adaptation algorithm', 'base', 'data dissemination', 'data exploration', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feature detection', 'field study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'movie', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical research', 'scale up', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment']",NIMH,ISTOVISR,R44,2020,1159612,-0.008287585765764495
"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,10017238,R01EB028337,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Crystallization', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Gamma Rays', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portugal', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rod', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain size', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2020,243919,0.0005951995339051864
"Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK Abstract Thousands of medical researchers around the world use VTK —the Visualization Toolkit— an open-source, freely available software development toolkit providing advanced 3D interactive visualization, image processing and data analysis algorithms. They either use VTK directly in their in-house research applications or indirectly via one of the multitude of medical image analysis and bioinformatics applications that is built using VTK: Osirix, 3D Slicer, BioImageXD, MedINRIA, SCIRun, ParaView, and others. Furthermore, VTK also provides 3D visualizations for clinical applications such as BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system and Zimmer’s prosthesis design and evaluation platform. VTK has been downloaded many hundreds of thousands of times since its initial release in 1993. Considering its broad distribution and prevalent use, it can be argued that VTK has had a greater impact on medical research, and patient care, than any other open-source visualization package.  This proposal is in response to the multitude of requests we have been receiving from the VTK medical community. The aims are as follows:  1. Aim 1: Adaptive visualization framework: Produce an integrated framework that supports  visualization applications that balance server-side and client-side processing depending on data size,  analysis requirements, and the user platform (e.g., phone, tablet, or GPU-enabled desktop).  2. Aim 2: Integrated, interactive applications: Extend VTK to support a diversity of programming  paradigms ranging from C++ to JavaScript to Python and associated tools such as Jupyter Notebooks,  integrating with emerging technologies such as deep learning technologies.  3. Aim 3: Advanced rendering, including AR/VR: Target shader-based rendering systems and AR/VR  libraries that achieve high frame rates with minimal latency for ubiquitous applications that combine  low-cost, portable devices such as phones, ultrasound transducers, and other biometric sensors for  visually monitoring, guiding, and delivering advanced healthcare.  4. Aim 4: Infrastructure, Outreach, and Validation: Engage the VTK community and the proposed  External Advisory Board during the creation and assessment of the proposed work and corresponding  modern, digital documentation in the form of videos and interactive web-based content. Project Narrative The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software library for the interactive display and processing of medical images. It is being used in most major medical imaging research applications, e.g., 3D Slicer and Osirix, and in several commercial medical applications, e.g., BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system. VTK development began in 1993 and since then an extensive community of users and developers has grown around it. However, the rapid advancement of cloud computing, GPU hardware, deep learning algorithms, and VR/AR systems require corresponding advances in VTK so that the research and products that depend on VTK continue to deliver leading edge healthcare technologies. With the proposed updates, not only will existing applications continue to provide advanced healthcare, but new, innovative medical applications will also be inspired.",Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK,9910382,R01EB014955,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biometry', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Publications', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virtual and Augmented reality', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cloud based', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'digital', 'health care delivery', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'open source', 'outreach', 'point of care', 'portability', 'processing speed', 'real world application', 'response', 'sensor', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'synergism', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'trend', 'web services']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2020,510157,0.007847010293634217
"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three-dimensional (3D) whole-brain imaging of non-transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole-brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole-brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole-brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo-bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide-spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state-of-the-art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,10019728,R44MH116827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2020,1313060,-0.004361768601335295
"Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies Project Abstract Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) continues to play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease (CAD). While conventional SPECT scanners using parallel-hole collimators are still the foundation of cardiac SPECT, recently our field observed an exciting growth of new developments of dedicated cardiac scanners. Such dedicated scanners, such as the GE Alcyone 530/570c systems and the D-SPECT systems both with CZT detectors, typically have multiple detectors collecting photons emitted from the heart simultaneously, leading to dramatically improved sensitivity (2-5 X). In addition, the GE systems use pinhole collimators and can achieve much higher resolution. These dedicated scanners opened doors to new applications with significant clinical impact, including ultra-low-dose imaging, absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), high resolution molecular imaging, multi-isotope imaging, motion correction, and many more. Most of these new applications are uniquely achievable only using dedicated scanners. While the dedicated cardiac SPECT systems can improve clinical practice and lead to numerous new clinical applications, such systems are far from being optimized to fully realize their great potentials. In this grant, we propose to systematically develop and optimize innovative imaging technologies for the GE 530/570c systems to further improve its clinical efficacy in a variety of significant ways. In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize methods for static cardiac SPECT imaging. We will develop various deep learning methods and investigate approaches to increase angular sampling to reduce noise, and improve resolution and quantitative accuracy. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate methods for dynamic SPECT imaging, particularly involving direct parametric image reconstruction. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate methods for dual-isotope SPECT. Monte Carso simulation and deep learning based methods will be developed for tracers with different spatial distributions and fast kinetics. In all three aims, large animal studies and human subject data will be used for optimization and validation. Narrative The success of imaging technology developments proposed in this grant will substantially improve the image quality, reduce patient dose, expand the applications of cardiac SPECT from mainly static imaging to dynamic imaging, and establish multi-isotope clinical imaging.",Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies,10064473,R01HL154345,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collimator', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DCNU', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infarction', 'Isotopes', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Molecular Target', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myopathy', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Tail', 'Toxic effect', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Validation', 'animal data', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical application', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'new growth', 'parametric imaging', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'technology development']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,806926,0.03027913842889363
"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype. Project Narrative Our group has established the only three-dimensional form of histology that is suitable for histopathology and quantitative tissue phenotyping, tissue X-ray microtomography (micro-CT). We outline here a plan to establish mechanisms for increasing resolution and field-of-view, to add sample multiplexing, to simply sample preparation, and to explore machine learning mechanisms for defining normal and abnormal structure towards whole-organism complete tissue phenotyping. The resulting tools will allow the community to comprehensively and computationally determine the roles of genes and environment in defining phenotype, which has implications in drug development, biomedical research, and medicine.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),9991958,R24OD018559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Genetics', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cesium', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Iodides', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve', 'Normal Range', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Preparation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spiral Computed Tomography', 'Stains', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Zebrafish', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'clinical toxicology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data dissemination', 'data sharing', 'detector', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'feature detection', 'histological studies', 'human disease', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'millimeter', 'mutant', 'programs', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2020,655482,0.004080951677559646

This project will compare changes seen at 3T and 7T across two different vendors systems and assess the potential for 7T MRI to improve our ability to study and develop new disease- modifying therapies. This study will enhance future studies and clinical exams at 7T and can be used to improve routine 3T MRI though machine learning reconstruction and enhanced understanding of OA disease mechanisms. Understanding the relative strengths of 3T and 7T MRI in this important clinical application is critical to developing new disease-modifying treatments for patients with OA. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for development of disease-modifying treatments. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using 3T and 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health across different tissues in osteoarthritis.",Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI,10071340,R01EB002524,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Cartilage', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GAG Gene', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Orthopedics', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Proteoglycan', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'clinical application', 'clinical examination', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy trial', 'imaging approach', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'mechanical properties', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'quantitative imaging', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,612595,0.013698951609443519
"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution.

"Virtual growing child 5-dimensional functional models for treating respiratory anomalies Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome (TIS) is a group of serious disorders of the pediatric thorax resulting in an inability of the thorax to support respiration or lung growth. TIS is associated with at least 28 pediatric syndromes, with an estimated health care cost per patient that can easily exceed a million dollars. In TIS, three-dimensional deformity of the thoracic components anatomically and functionally reduces the volume available for ventilation. Pediatric specialists dealing with TIS currently face several serious challenges: (a) The complex interplay among dynamic and growing thoracic structures and its influence on thoracic function and growth are not understood at present. (b) The prime outcome measure for the corrective procedures has remained the radiographic Cobb angle of the spine, a 60-year old metric with poor correlation with lung dynamic function and limited true health assessment value. (c) A normative imaging database with functional metrics describing dynamics and growth of the thoracic structures of the normal pediatric population does not exist. Due to these hurdles, innovations in growth-modulating surgical techniques are difficult to achieve. Supported by extensive preliminary results based on dynamic MRI (dMRI) of patients and normal subjects, the overarching goal of this proposal is to develop novel dynamic functional metrics for TIS by establishing a normative database of dMRI images and anatomic and functional models and metrics, and to translate these to develop markers of TIS and of its corrective-surgery outcomes. The project has three aims. Aim 1: To develop a new methodology called The Virtual Growing Child (VGC) consisting of 4 key components: a) To build a normative database of dMRI images prospectively gathered from 200 normal children divided into 10 groups. b) To build population anatomic models involving key thoraco-abdominal objects following an established automatic anatomy recognition (AAR) technology and deep learning (DL) techniques. c) To develop and validate joint AAR-DL algorithms to segment these objects in dMRI images of TIS patients. d) To build a normative database of measurements derived from dMRI images describing normal thoracic architecture, dynamic function, and growth. The database will also include a full battery of Pulmonary Function Testing data and anthropometric measurements. Aim 2: To test retrospectively the utility of the VGC ensemble in deriving markers of TIS and its surgical treatment effects on a cohort of 100 TIS patients. Aim 3: To retrospectively test the utility of the VGC approach for planning surgery in 30 TIS patients by comparing VGC-guided surgical planning to the current planning method. The post-operative key dMRI parameters of patients whose surgical plan would have changed due to VGC data will be compared to those of patients whose plan did not change. Expected outcomes: (i) A unique registry of thoracic dMRI of 200 normal pediatric subjects, segmented objects, and the associated anatomic, dynamic, and developmental parameters. (ii) A validated VGC approach for studying TIS which can also be utilized for studying other pediatric and adult thoracic disorders. Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome (TIS) is a group of serious disorders of the pediatric thorax. Currently there are no reliable and scientific functional metrics to describe these disorders and their treatment effects. This grant application proposes to build an innovative methodology called the Virtual Growing Child (VGC) based on dynamic MRI of the thorax, construct a comprehensive normative database of MRI images and associated measurements, and utilize the VGC methodology to scientifically characterize TIS and arrive at innovative surgical planning methods.",Virtual growing child 5-dimensional functional models for treating respiratory anomalies,9861454,R01HL150147,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Birth', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Lung', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Registries', 'Respiration', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Rod', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Fusion', 'Spirometry', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Diseases', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vertebral column', 'Vital capacity', 'age group', 'base', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'health assessment', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'surgery outcome', 'treatment effect', 'ventilation', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,799509,-0.0028621266154805233
"Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY  Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) disorder is a condition in which the placenta fails to separate partially or totally from the uterine wall, resulting in significant intrapartum maternal morbidity and mortality at delivery. Depending on the extent of the placental invasion into surrounding tissue, hysterectomy may be lifesaving. Assessment of PAS severity prior to delivery is crucial for multidisciplinary surgical planning and patient counseling. However, there is an unmet clinical need for quantitative, objective measures of abnormal placentation that can serve as predictors of risk of invasion and hysterectomy. The overall goal of the proposed project is to prospectively assess PAS in high-risk women across gestation using quantitative multi-parametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and automated textural radiomics and to correlate findings with surgical outcomes.  Coming from a highly interdisciplinary background of MR chemistry, biology, and physics, the candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with in-depth knowledge and skills to conduct translational placental imaging research. The candidate's short-term goal is to complete a pilot study under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary advisory committee to evaluate PAS in women with high-risk pregnancies using multi-parametric MRI and textural radiomics.  To meet these goals, the following research aims are proposed: 1) Evaluate placental invasion across gestation using multi-parametric MR imaging and deep learning based novel quantification tools in PAS high- risk pregnancies, and 2) Extract the radiomic pattern across gestation of high-risk PAS placenta and determine its association with clinical surgical outcome. These research aims will serve as the platform for the career development plan and training aims which include: 1) Gain knowledge in translational prospective research design, 2) Improve technical skills in advanced clinical MR acquisition development, 3) Acquire applied statistical and data analysis skills, and 4) Develop mentorship and leadership skills while under training.  Together, the research and training aims will provide the training, experience and preliminary data for an R01 application. The future R01 will develop a clinical and surgical outcome prediction model for high-risk PAS pregnancies, potentially improving maternal and fetal outcomes. The training will position the candidate to become a leader in translational placental imaging research. PROJECT NARRATIVE After a woman has had a cesarean delivery, if the placenta implants on the surgical scar in a subsequent pregnancy, there is a risk for invasion, referred to as placenta accreta spectrum (PAS); depending on its severity, a cesarean hysterectomy may be required with significant morbidity. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have shown promise in defining characteristics that alert the obstetrician to the severity of PAS. We will explore the vascularity and tissue characteristics of the placenta with MRI and identify quantitative predictive markers of disease severity and hope to better understand the pathophysiology of placenta accreta spectrum.",Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum,10105139,K25HD104004,"['Abnormal placentation', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cellularity', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Chemistry', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Risk Woman', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Perinatal', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Accreta', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Spin Labels', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterus', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'fetal', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'implantation', 'improved', 'interest', 'intrapartum', 'maternal morbidity', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NICHD,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K25,2020,114184,-0.04245526744597202
"Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients ABSTRACT The prevalence of obesity in the United States has risen to record levels over the past 40 years, putting strain on the healthcare system and creating difficult challenges for medical imaging. We propose to overcome the challenges that obesity poses to ultrasound imaging by (1) developing novel image-quality improvement techniques, and (2) implementing them on pulse-echo ultrasound imaging systems to yield high-quality images of the liver. Ultrasound imaging is uniquely affected by the presence of additional connective tissue and thick subcutaneous fat layers in overweight and obese patients; these additional subcutaneous layers greatly exacerbate reverberation and phase-aberration of the acoustic wave, leading to high levels of clutter, degraded resolution, and overall poor-quality ultrasound images. Our proposed methods will determine the local speed-of-sound in abdominal tissue layers and use this information to accomplish distributed phase-aberration correction. We also apply machine learning techniques to model and suppress the effects of reverberation clutter and speckle noise. The combination of these techniques is expected to achieve significant improvements in liver image quality. These image-quality improvement methods will be implemented on a real-time ultrasound scanner and will be evaluated in clinical imaging tasks of overweight and obese patients undergoing ultrasound surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Successful development of the proposed technology will not only enable high-quality ultrasound imaging of the liver in otherwise difficult-to-image overweight and obese patients, but also facilitate improved image quality across nearly all ultrasound imaging applications, for all populations. NARRATIVE This proposal aims to develop and test several new techniques to overcome the current limitations of ultrasound to make high-quality images in overweight and obese individuals. These novel ultrasound techniques will be initially applied to improve liver imaging in overweight and obese patients in a pilot study, though the benefits of this new high-quality imaging technology will extend to all other areas of clinical ultrasound imaging.",Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients,9885175,R01EB027100,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Weight', 'clinical imaging', 'elastography', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'liver imaging', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'simulation', 'sound', 'subcutaneous']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,590183,0.031330790529340034
"Opera Phenix High-Content Imaging System for Drug Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY The University of Pittsburgh Drug Discovery Institute (UPDDI) is requesting funds to purchase the Perkin Elmer OPERA PHENIX high speed, high resolution spinning disk confocal High-Content Screening (HCS) device. The Opera Phenix will replace two Molecular Devices ImageXpress Ultra high content readers purchased in 2008, which are critical to multiple NIH-, DoD-, and Foundation-funded projects at the University of Pittsburgh, but are no longer supported by the manufacturer and have been decommissioned. We have determined that one Opera Phenix instrument can replace the two IXUs. The Phenix is a third generation HCS instrument that will be essential to satisfy the diverse needs of users that the UPDDI serves. No comparable instruments exist at the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and Carnegie Mellon University. Over the last decade, HCS has become a standard in the pharmaceutical industry for target identification, phenotypic screening, as well as toxicology, and in academia for large-scale biological studies, where cell-by- cell quantitation is critical. The UPDDI has been an academic pioneer in the application of HCS and serves an extensive number of collaborators across campus that require and rely on HCS, ranging from neurodegeneration, organ regeneration, cancer, liver diseases, organotypic model development, and traumatic brain injury. Our diverse user groups’ needs emphasize discovery models of physiological relevance and high complexity, and therefore require fast, high resolution 2D, 3D, and kinetic imaging and maximum flexibility in image analysis. The large number of HCS users working in the UPDDI further demands a fast system to permit effective sharing of instrument time, and an integrated database with off-site user access to perform off- line analysis. Key requirements for an HCS imager therefore are superior speed in acquiring z-series of images at high resolution of thick specimens in aqueous matrices, mature yet flexible image algorithms, and seamless integration of instrument software with system, public,and custom-developed UPDDI databases. The only instrument that meets all of these criteria is the Opera Phenix because it has 1) fast laser-based illumination and the ability to acquire multiple channels simultaneously 2) water immersion objectives that eliminate non-matching refractive indices, which limit spherical aberrations of air and oil objectives at longer working distances and require adjustment of correction collars depending on imaging depth; 3) a powerful suite of user-friendly yet flexible image analysis routines including a 3D module, advanced texture and morphology analysis, and intuitive and user-friendly machine learning; and 4) the ability to perform seamless “adaptive high-resolution imaging”, i.e., pre-scanning a large area at low magnification, followed by automated “on-the- fly” switching to higher magnification to acquire high resolution images of user-defined regions of interest. The Opera Phenix is the only instrument on the market that is capable of fulfilling the demands of the University of Pittsburgh’s diverse drug discovery community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Modern drug discovery increasingly demands better and more disease relevant models and the ability to analyze them. High-content screening (HCS) has become indispensable in the analysis of such models as it permits the analysis of cells, their constituents, and interactions in their proper biological context. The third generation HCS instrument, Opera Phenix, produces the quality and quantity of data from cells, tissues and experimental animals that are required for computational and systems biological investigations, while at the same time providing the throughput needed for automated screening.",Opera Phenix High-Content Imaging System for Drug Discovery,9935240,S10OD028450,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academia', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Drug Industry', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immersion', 'Institutes', 'Intuition', 'Kinetics', 'Lasers', 'Lighting', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical center', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oils', 'Phenotype', 'Reader', 'Refractive Indices', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Texture', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Water', 'aqueous', 'base', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'organ regeneration', 'physiologic model', 'screening', 'user-friendly']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,S10,2020,1010594,-0.010736738597199499

"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10005472,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,628430,-0.0015947503025370898
"High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging The cornea is the primary focusing structure of our visual system. Infections and diseases in the tissue can impair vision and lead to blindness, even in eyes with intact neurosensory function. Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness in the world. Tissue evaluation is an important step for assessing the health of the donor cornea and its appropriateness for different types of placement, yet this process suffers from high subjectivity. High-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist in selection of the most appropriate tissue for transplant. Progress on this front would greatly serve public need, as the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide, with nearly 185,000 transplants annually. Thus, a more sensitive and quantitative method for objective evaluation of tissue at eye banks is needed. We have developed a 3D high-definition imaging instrument based on Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GDOCM). Our SBIR Phase I research successfully accomplished all Aims and demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative assessment of corneal tissue over a large field of view with GDOCM. Our Phase I results demonstrated that GDOCM has the following key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1) improved accuracy of tissue qualification with 4-10x increase in field of view that reduces sampling error – this will provides a truer assessment of the overall tissue characteristics; 2) ability to simultaneously measure corneal thickness, quantify endothelial cell density, and identify morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to complete corneal evaluation in a single instrument; 3) leveraging machine learning innovations to minimize variability induced by users – this will result in a more objective evaluation; 4) enhanced 3D cellular-level imaging of thin translucent endothelial cells – this will enable a detailed understanding of cell viability. The results of the proposed Phase studies II will demonstrate that GDOCM can provide high-definition, 3D visualization of corneal structures with immediate commercial application for qualification of donor tissue in eye banks, and with a path to in vivo clinical imaging of patients with corneal disease.

"Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) using the radiolabeled tracer 2- deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has become a standard imaging tool for cancer patient management. The semi-quantitative parameter standardized uptake value (SUV) is routinely used in clinical for tumor uptake quantification, which is computed on the static PET image acquired at a certain time (typically 60 min) post tracer injection for a short interval (typically 5-15 min). However, the quantification accuracy of SUV from a single PET scan suffers from the variabilities of tracer plasma clearance and acquisition start time. The dual- time-point FDG PET imaging has been intensively investigated and used in both clinical and research studies, typically one scan at 60 min and the other at 120 min, showing the potential to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET by differentiating malignancy from inflammation and normal tissue. However, the current clinical dual-time-point FDG PET studies use the relative SUV change between two scans as the quantification index, which cannot eliminate the variations in tracer plasma clearance. Meanwhile, the dual-time-point protocol has not been optimized and standardized currently, leading to conflicting results. The fully-quantitative parameter, tracer net uptake rate constant Ki, is the most accurate parameter to quantify FDG PET, which is calculated using dynamic imaging with compartmental modeling. Ki is independent on the plasma clearance or acquisition start time. However, the long and complex acquisition protocol (typically at least 60 min), which requires dynamic scanning and sequential arterial blood sampling (or image-derived blood activity) used as input function from the time of injection, limits its application in clinical practice. Meanwhile, generation of the parametric Ki image, which can provide additional heterogeneity information for FDG PET, is challenging clinically using voxel-by-voxel compartmental modeling due to the computational cost and being sensitive to noise using non-linear least squares. The graphical Patlak plot, can be used for simplified Ki calculation and Ki image generation by voxel-by-voxel fitting. However, it still needs dynamic scanning starting from 15-30 min after injection and input function from the time of injection. The aims of this proposal are 1) to optimize the dual-time-point protocol for accurate Ki quantification using Patlak plot without the need for individual patient's input function, and 2) to generate high-quality low-noise dual-time-point Ki images using novel techniques based on deep learning. Upon the success of this project, our proposed approach can obtain reliable tumor Ki quantification and parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual- time-point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology. We expect the translation of this approach to clinical investigation to be fast, as this is a post-processing approach and is based on data already acquired using clinically used protocol without imposing additional burden to technologists. Project Narrative For FDG PET imaging, we propose to develop a novel and simple approach of quantifying tumor Ki and generating parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual-time- point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology.",Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans,9896329,R03EB027864,"['Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Inflammation', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Plasma', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiolabeled', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'parametric imaging', 'population based', 'research study', 'simulation', 'success', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,80375,0.010338606834434109
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. It will pve the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process.",MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning,9843490,R01CA193730,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'anatomic imaging', 'attenuation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'density', 'electron density', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'primary endpoint', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,354198,0.034273605228212566
"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,10019348,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2020,314388,0.01655366523195308
"Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam Abstract Non-invasive, multi-parametric characterization of prostate cancer (PC), with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, is an active area of research with great potential for providing improved diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The PI-RADSv2 assessment system that was established by an international team of experts recognizes the value of quantitative images in PC diagnosis, but relies largely on qualitative evaluation of weighted images. Although this grading approach achieves reasonably good separation be- tween normal and abnormal prostate tissue, it does not achieve adequate separation between indolent and aggressive disease, with the risk that more unnecessary and costly surgery is performed with poten- tially dire consequences on patient quality of life. High-value protocols, without need for an invasive and costly endo-rectal radio-frequency coil are being investigated. This comes at the cost of extended scan time and reduced image quality in terms of spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and signal bias, which negatively impacts sensitivity and speciﬁcity of multi-parametric MRI. With the pronounced increase of multi-parametric MRI exams, there is also the desire to integrate the support by the most recent revolution in diagnostic imaging, i.e., machine learning. It becomes increasingly clear, that in order to avoid having to train neural networks for each speciﬁc system and protocol, reproducible and thus preferably quantitative imaging protocols are essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose both pulse sequence develop- ment, investigation of ADC validity and reproducibility and novel post-processing strategies. The overall objective is to demonstrate the added value of lesion characterization with quantitative values and at the same time understand and minimize the inﬂuence of protocol choices and scan hardware, hence improve overall reproducibility. Speciﬁc Aim 1 will focus on the development of a low distortion MR imaging sequence for rapid concurrent quantiﬁcation of T2 and diﬀusion signal decay. Speciﬁc Aim 2 will examine ADC variations that result from changes in diﬀusion time over a range that is typical with present day clinical MR systems. Speciﬁc Aim 3 introduces advanced handling of low noise diﬀusion data, which will be indispensable for achieving high accuracy and precision with non-invasive and economic external coils. Speciﬁc Aim 4 introduces a novel ADC computation approach that fully captures the complex diﬀusion signal decays in tissues and at the same time is largely protocol and system independent. Moreover, re- sulting images and quantitative maps processed according this approach, exhibit considerably lower noise, which can be traded for higher spatial resolution or shorter scan duration. In combination, the consis- tently quantitative nature of the data and its ubiquitous validity and comparability will greatly facilitate the establishment of recommendations for disease-related thresholds. Ultimately this may permit much more reliable diﬀerentiation of aggressive from indolent disease. Project Narrative Magnetic resonance imaging plays an important role for staging of prostate cancer. We propose advances that permit quantitative and a more reliable assessment of prostate cancer. Potentially this will permit better diﬀerentiation of disease that is aggressive from disease that poses low risk of spreading.",Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam,9973564,R01CA241817,"['Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Fingerprint', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recommendation', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'cancer diagnosis', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'method development', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'quantitative imaging', 'radio frequency', 'rectal']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,454234,-0.0052052445803605595
"In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging ABSTRACT There is still great need in better characterizing new targeted therapies in vivo, especially prior to clinical translation. In this regard, preclinical molecular imaging is a central tool in the targeted drug development pipeline. However, there is still a lack of integrated imaging platforms that can enable longitudinal (multiple time points) and spatially-resolved monitoring of complex fingerprints including molecular, metabolic and functional signatures in the same tumor/subject. This new integrated multiplexing imaging platform will play a crucial role in the development of the next generation of targeted drugs and elucidating (multi-) drug resistance mechanisms. Recently, we have demonstrated the unique capabilities of optical imaging in quantifying receptor-target engagement in live subjects by leveraging fluorescence lifetime. This outstanding achievement was realized thanks to the combination of instrumental, algorithmic and biochemical innovations to enable, for the first time, whole-body time-resolved optical imaging based on structured light for 2D or 3D Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging in live subjects. Herein, we will further impact the field of optical preclinical imaging and drug delivery assessment by 1) integrating a cutting-edge high-resolution, time-resolved SPAD array imager for improved photon collection efficiency, spatial resolution, and portability; 2) we will harness the latest developments in Deep Learning (DL) for ultra-fast, quantitative, but fitting/iterative inverse solver-free image formation, in both 2D and 3D providing image formation/processing solutions to facilitate multiplexed imaging; 3) we will implement new functionalities in our imaging platform to enable the concurrent longitudinal imaging of multiple clinically relevant target-receptor interactions (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as metabolic and functional status across the whole-tumor region in live intact animals. NARRATIVE Following an ever increased focus on personalized medicine, there is a continuing need to develop preclinical molecular imaging modalities to guide the development and optimization of targeted therapies. This research program will combine novel time-resolved cameras as well as deep learning techniques to broaden the impact of macroscopic lifetime imaging with the overarching goal to facilitate multiplexed imaging for a comprehensive assessment of cellular delivery efficacy of multiple clinically relevant drugs (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as drug response via metabolic and functional status across the whole-tumor region in live intact animals.",In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging,9997447,R01CA250636,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Electronics', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Family member', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hemoglobin', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging ligands', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Reporter Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'functional status', 'imager', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multiplexed imaging', 'new technology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical imaging', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'targeted treatment', 'technological innovation', 'tomography', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly']",NCI,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,637634,0.015086290023450747
"Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred or fibrotic heart tissue plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive, multifaceted imaging modality and is the clinical gold standard for scar and fibrotic cardiac tissue imaging with use of gadolinium-based contrast injection. However, administration of such gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired kidney function? a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. Until recently, GBCA was presumed to be safe in patients with normal kidney function; however, there are emerging data on long-term GBCA retention in the body. We aim to develop two complimentary approaches to reduce GBCA use in myocardial, or cardiac muscle, scar imaging. Initially, we will develop a quantitative risk-benefit model to identify NICM patients with a low chance of having scarred myocardium. Concurrently, we will develop a GBCA-free cardiac MR myocardial tissue probe platform based on AI (MyoProbe.ai) to quantify scarred regions of the heart. To accomplish this, we will develop and evaluate an individualized, patient-specific scar prediction model to reduce GBCA use in NICM patients with different etiologies by training the model to learn to identify whether the patient is likely to have scarring based on non-contrast images. If it is unlikely that a patient has scarring, contrast administration can be avoided. To develop and evaluate MyoProbe.ai for GBCA-free quantification of myocardial scar in CHD patients, we will use AI to integrate signal intensity and heart motion data from MRI images to accurately locate and quantify scar tissue. This information can then be used by cardiologists to diagnose and treat the patient. We will rigorously validate our risk-benefit model and AI myocardial probe platform using retrospectively and prospectively collected cardiac MRI images from multiple healthcare centers, MRI vendors, and magnetic field strengths. Our dataset will include different types of NICM and CHD patient populations to ensure that our work is applicable to patients with many different types of NICM and CHD. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred/fibrotic heart tissue with gadolinium- based contrast agents (GBCA) plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). However, administration of GBCAs prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, contaminates surface and drinking water, is retained in the body long-term, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired renal function– a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. The goal of our study is to reduce or eliminate GBCA use in cardiac MR scar imaging using artificial intelligence (AI) by concurrently developing a quantitative model to identify NICM patients with a low likelihood of scarring and a GBCA-free cardiac MR AI platform to quantify scar tissue.",Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis,10072898,R01HL154744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Fibrosis', 'Fostering', 'Gadolinium', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired Renal Function', 'Impairment', 'Injections', 'Ischemia', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reference Standards', 'Relaxation', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drinking water', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'radiomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,946194,0.025808383784282567
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,9997783,R01AR074492,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Arthralgia', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Spur', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone remodeling', 'Canes', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fluoride Ion', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Needs Assessment', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteotomy', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone', 'bone metabolism', 'cartilage metabolism', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'flexibility', 'gait examination', 'gait rehabilitation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'joint loading', 'kinetic model', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mineralization', 'molecular marker', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'subchondral bone', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,435694,0.016154849533412015
"Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion Project Summary/Abstract X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been increasingly used in medical diagnosis, currently reaching more than 100 million CT scans every year in the US. The increasing use of CT has sparked concern over the effects of radiation dose on patients. It is estimated that every 2000 CT scans will cause one future cancer, i.e., 50,000 cases of future cancers from 100 million CT scans every year. CT brain perfusion (CTP) is a widely used imaging technique for the evaluation of hemodynamic changes in stroke and cerebrovascular disorders. However, CTP involves high radiation dose for patients as the CTP scan is repeated on the order of 40 times at the same anatomical location, in order to capture the full passage of the contrast bolus. Several techniques have been applied for radiation dose reduction in CTP scans, including reduction of tube current and tube voltage, as well as the use of noise reduction techniques such as iterative reconstruction (IR). However, the resultant radiation dose of existing CTP scans is still significantly higher than that of a standard head CT scan. The application of IR techniques in CTP is very limited due to the high complexity and computational burden for processing multiple CTP images that impairs clinical workflow. During the Phase 1 STTR project, we introduced a novel low dose CTP imaging method based on the k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC) reconstruction algorithm. We performed thorough evaluation in both a CTP phantom and clinical CTP datasets, and demonstrated that the KWIC algorithm is able to reduce the radiation dose of existing CTP techniques by 75% without affecting the image quality and accuracy of quantification (i.e., Milestone of Phase 1 STTR). However, the original KWIC algorithm requires rapid-switching pulsed X-ray at pre-specified rotation angles – a hardware capability yet to be implemented by commercial CT vendors. In order to address this limitation, we recently introduced a variant of the KWIC algorithm termed k-space weighted image average (KWIA) that preserves high spatial and temporal resolutions as well as image quality of low dose CTP data (~75% dose reduction) to be comparable to those of standard CTP scans. Most importantly, KWIA does not require modification of existing CT hardware and is computationally simple and fast, therefore has a low barrier for market penetration. The purpose of the Phase 2 STTR project is to further optimize and validate the KWIA algorithm for reducing radiation dose of CTP scans by ~75% while preserving the image quality and quantification accuracy in CTP phantom, clinical CTP data and animal studies. We will further develop innovative deep-learning (DL) based algorithms to address potential motion and other artifacts in KWIA, and commercialize the developed algorithms by collaborating with CT vendors. Relevance to Public Health More than 100 million CT scans are performed every year in the US, estimated to cause 50,000 cases of future cancers. This project will develop, evaluate and commercialize novel CT imaging technologies that reduce the radiation dose of existing CT perfusion techniques by ~75% without compromising imaging speed or quality.",Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion,10006737,R44EB024438,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Animals', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Location', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Tube', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'low dose computed tomography', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'radiation effect', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'voltage']",NIBIB,"HURA IMAGING, INC",R44,2020,820709,0.026938998496323575
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9942461,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,391938,0.016270404768033847
"NeuroExplorer: Ultra-high Performance Human Brain PET Imager for Highly-resolved In Vivo Imaging of Neurochemistry Research applications of brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) have been in place for over 40 years. The combination of quantitative PET systems with novel radiotracers has led to a numerous imaging para- digms to understand normal brain physiology including neurotransmitter dynamics and receptor pharmacology at rest and during activation. Brain-dedicated PET systems offer important advantages over currently available PET systems in terms of sensitivity and resolution. However, the state-of-the-art for brain PET has not progressed beyond the 20-year-old HRRT. Therefore, there is a compelling need to build the next generation of brain PET systems for human studies. This proposal brings together a highly experienced collaborative team from Yale, UC Davis, and United Imaging Healthcare America (UIHA). to develop the next generation NeuroEXPLORER (NX) PET system with the following Aims. Specific Aim 1: Design and Build the NeuroEXPLORER: In 2 years, we will complete the design and build the NX system. The design includes high performance LYSO-SiPM blocks with small detectors, 4-mm depth-of-interaction, 250 ps time-of-flight resolution, and axial length of ~50 cm, paired with CT for attenuation correction. This design will produce a factor of 10 greater effective sensitivity than the HRRT and practical resolution of 1.5-2 mm in the human brain. The system will include built-in real-time state-of-art motion tracking cameras and will be tested using novel phantom experiments to assess the full-range of operation to validate the dramatic improvement in small- region precision and accuracy. Specific Aim 2: Algorithm Development for Fully-Quantitative Brain PET. We will develop the novel algorithms for this system. Using EXPLORER experience. we will implement reconstruction algorithms to produce dynamic images with uniform ultra-high resolution in space and time, Extending Yale’s HRRT motion correction experience, we will develop camera-based motion detection and correction algorithms to deliver ultra-high resolution human brain images. Using the carotid artery shape and geometry, we will develop methods to accurately measure blood activity to be compared to human arterial data with the goal to permit kinetic modeling without arterial sampling. We will develop noise reduction methods with machine learning to reduce dose for studying health brains and to eliminate the need for the CT scan for attenuation correction. Specific Aim 3: Human Paradigm Demonstration. With human subjects, we will evaluate specific imaging paradigms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NX system: 1) demonstration of the dramatic sensitivity increase (with a direct comparison to the HRRT) and its impact on detection of pharmacologic effects, 2) leveraging high sensitivity to reliably measure uptake in small nuclei; and 3) opening new frontiers of imaging neurotransmitter dynamics, including dopamine and opioid release. The ultimate goal is a fully functioning and characterized system that dramatically expands the scope of brain PET protocols and applications. Human research applications of brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging have been in place for over 40 years and have led to a detailed understand of normal brain physiology including neurotransmitter dynamics and receptor pharmacology at rest and during activation.

"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure. This research proposal seeks to develop a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and monitoring of small-vessel coronary dysfunction by developing innovative and reliable magnetic resonance imaging strategies. Our proposal has the potential to improve patient care in this population by providing a noninvasive alternative to the established invasive testing procedure, which carries a risk of complications and is only available at highly specialized medical centers.",Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI,10037606,R01HL153430,"['Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microspheres', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Nature', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Systole', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'recruit', 'sequence learning']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,699398,-0.021759482220768737
"Simultaneous coaxial widefield imaging and reflectance confocal microscopy for improved diagnosis of skin cancers in vivo 1 Dermatologists rely on visual (clinical widefield) and dermoscopic examination of skin lesions to guide the need  2 for biopsy. With this approach, sensitivity is high, but specificity tends to be quite variable and lower, resulting  3 in millions of biopsies of benign lesions every year. To improve specificity, several optical technologies are  4 being developed to noninvasively detect skin cancer. Of these, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is the  5 furthest advanced in clinical utility, proven for diagnosing skin cancers with high sensitivity and specificity.  6 RCM imaging, guided by dermoscopy, detects skin cancers with 2 times superior specificity, and reduces the  7 benign-to-malignant biopsy rate by 2 times, compared to that with dermoscopy alone. In 2016, the Centers for  8 Medicare and Medicaid Services granted current procedural terminology (CPT) reimbursement codes for RCM  9 imaging of skin. RCM imaging combined with dermoscopy is now advancing into clinical practice, sparing pa- 10 tients from unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. However, toward widespread acceptance and adoption, a 11 key challenge is that clinical widefield examination, dermoscopy and RCM imaging are currently performed as 12 three separate procedures with separate devices. Clinicians do not precisely know the location of RCM imag- 13 es relative to the surrounding contextual lesion morphology that is seen with clinical widefield examination and 14 dermoscopy, resulting in lower and more variable diagnostic accuracy (particularly, sensitivity, positive and 15 negative predictive values). We propose a novel solution: (i) a new objective lens with an integrated micro- 16 camera, to deliver a concurrent widefield image of the skin surface surrounding the location of RCM imaging; 17 (ii) a new software algorithm for widefield image-based tracking of the location of RCM images within a dermoscopic 18 field of view; (iii) a new diagnostic approach that will proactively use widefield imaging to locate RCM images in 19 dermoscopic images. We intend to deliver this integrated widefield clinical, dermoscopic and RCM imaging ap- 20 proach into the clinic, toward a new standard for more accurate, consistent and faster RCM imaging to guide 21 patient care. Preliminary studies with a “mock” objective lens and micro-camera on a bench-top set-up 22 demonstrated excellent optical sectioning (~2 µm) and resolution (~1 µm) for RCM imaging, and accurate and 23 repeatable location of RCM fields-of-view within the widefield image. RCM images showed excellent cellular 24 and morphologic detail in vivo. Our specific aims are (1) to develop a handheld reflectance confocal micro- 25 scope with integrated widefield camera; (2) to develop image processing algorithms for real-time widefield im- 26 aging-guided tracking of RCM image locations within dermoscopic fields; (3) to test and validate performance 27 on 100 patients. Although our proposition is for skin lesions, the research will surely have wider impact for 28 imaging in other settings, particularly, with miniaturized confocal microscopes and endoscopes, which have 29 very small fields-of-view. We are a highly synergistic team from Montana State University, Memorial Sloan 30 Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and Caliber Imaging and Diagnostics (formerly, Lucid Inc.). RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Clinical examination and dermoscopy combined with reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging is a newly emerging optical imaging procedure that can noninvasively guide diagnosis of skin cancers, and reduce the need for biopsy. However, clinical examination, dermoscopy and RCM imaging are currently performed as three separate procedures with separate devices, limiting effectiveness and impact. We propose a device to combine the three into a single procedure, which will help dermatologists and patients by making the skin examinations quicker, more accurate and more consistent, expanding the impact of this proven approach.",Simultaneous coaxial widefield imaging and reflectance confocal microscopy for improved diagnosis of skin cancers in vivo,9860776,R01EB028752,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Center', 'Categories', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Current Procedural Terminology', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermatology', 'Dermis', 'Dermoscopy', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Effectiveness', 'Endoscopes', 'Engineering', 'Epidermis', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lesion', 'Lesion by Morphology', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicaid services', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Montana', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical examination', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gastrointestinal', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lens', 'medical specialties', 'microscopic imaging', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'optical imaging', 'prospective test', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'response', 'routine practice', 'skin lesion', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY - BOZEMAN,R01,2020,649717,0.0033208962159323317
"Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI Project Summary We propose a technical feasibility study seeking to develop methods for quantitative kinematic proﬁling of moving joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of this study, a kinematic proﬁle is deﬁned as a collection of joint characteristics computed and tracked during the course of movement. This project is motivated by the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. At a high level, it is envisioned that the proposed kinematic proﬁles could ﬁt into clinical management workﬂows much in the same way as blood biomarker panels.  While kinematic imaging of joints can be performed using plain-ﬁlm (PF) X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) methods, MRI is the gold-standard for advanced orthopedic assessment and is an appealing option for accessory kinematic analysis. A set of relatively fast kinematic proﬁling acquisitions could feasibly be added to routine orthopedic MRI exams, thereby providing optimal diagnostic imaging in both static and kinematic contexts within a single visit.  Though several preliminary studies have hinted at the potential diagnostic value of kinematic imaging data, such data is difﬁcult to interpret and cannot easily be quantiﬁed or captured in clinical records. In this study, we seek to establish fundamental methods that can provide simple and easily digestible kinematic imaging reports with data acquired in a short scan interval using conventional clinical MRI equipment.  As a preliminary feasibility investigation of these methods, kinematic imaging of the wrist will be studied. Dysfunction of the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist is a well-studied kinematic problem of diagnostic signiﬁcance. Novel 4D zero-echo-time MRI of the wrist will be used to capture the kinematic imaging using for proﬁling of the scaphoid-lunate mechanics during two established wrist movement patterns.  The goal of this project is to establish and demonstrate methodological components required for MRI kinematic proﬁling. Data collection on a modest-sized cohort of 100 healthy control subjects is proposed for this purpose. Novel MRI pulse-sequence and post-processing development components are introduced and tasked for analysis of this normative data. Using the acquired MRI data, kinematic parameters for each dynamic dataset will be extracted and curated into a multi-parametric proﬁle for each subject.  Aim 2 of the study proposes the use of external sensor motion capture methods to validate the MRI-based kinematic parameter measurements on 50% of the study cohort.  Finally, Aim 3 of the study seeks to use machine-learning clustering approaches to develop a kinematic proﬁle normalization procedure using the acquired control dataset. Such normalization is a crucial milestone in the translation of kinematic proﬁling to the clinic and will establish a baseline for future translational studies of symptomatic cohorts. Project Narrative We seek to develop and demonstrate fundamental methods in quantitative kinematic proﬁling using clinical diagnostic imaging equipment. This technical development project is constructed under the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. Using currently available advanced magnetic resonance imaging technology, data collected from a controlled subject cohort will be used to develop and test the proposed kinematic proﬁling technology on the moving wrist.",Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI,9893679,R21AR075327,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Process', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Film', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Scaphoid bone', 'Semilunar Bone', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Wrist joint', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'blood perfusion', 'bone', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'heart function', 'high resolution imaging', 'human subject', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'motion sensor', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'soft tissue', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'translational study', 'volunteer', 'water diffusion']",NIAMS,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2020,214720,0.030956581866458676
"FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring Project Abstract/Summary Ultra-low dose CT, defined as sub-millisievert (sub-mSv) imaging of the entire chest, abdomen or pelvis, is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, photon starvation and electronic noise make imaging at such dose levels challenging. Photon starvation refers to the number of transmitted photons. When no photons are transmitted, the measurement is essentially useless. If few photons are transmitted, the measurement carries information, but its interpretation and value are confounded by electronic noise. Solutions with encouraging results have been offered for sub-mSv chest imaging, but these are not widely available and not easily generalizable across anatomical sites, vendors and scanner models. We propose a novel, robust solution for ultra-low dose CT that will overcome these issues. We refer to our solution as FAIR-CT, which stands for Finite-Angle Integrated-Ray CT. FAIR-CT operates under the principle that photon starvation and the confounding effect of electronic noise are best handled by avoiding them, which is made possible by increasing the data integration time during the source-detector rotation. FAIR-CT data strongly deviate from the classical CT data model and share the streak artifact problem of sparse view sampling. FAIR-CT data acquisition also affects azimuthal resolution. We anticipate that these issues can be suitably handled using advanced image reconstruction techniques. Once available, FAIR-CT will allow improvements in longitudinal monitoring of patients with chronic diseases such as COPD, urolithiasis and diabetes, thereby reducing mortality and co-morbidities. FAIR-CT will also allow advancing cancer therapy treatments by enabling adjustments in radiation therapy plans between dose fractions without increasing CT radiation exposure, and by facilitating early detection of inflammations in drug-based therapies. To bring FAIR-CT towards fruition, we will work on two specific aims: (1) Creation of a comprehensive collection of FAIR-CT data sets enabling rigorous development, validation and evaluation of image reconstruction algorithms; (2) Development, validation and evaluation of advanced image reconstruction algorithms. The FAIR-CT data sets will involve the utilization of state-of-the-art scanners and include real patient data synthesized from high dose scans acquired for standard of care. Two complementary image reconstruction approaches will be investigated. Namely, model-based iterative reconstruction with non-linear forward model and dedicated compressed sensing regularization; and deep learning-based refinement of FBP reconstructions using target images with task-adapted image quality. Image quality evaluation will account for critical biological variables and involve objective metrics such as structure similarity and contrast-to-noise ratio for clinically-proven lesions, as well as task-based performance metrics involving human readers. Ultra-low dose X-ray computed tomography is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, physics-related challenges and impractical solutions make this concept unavailable for everyday clinical use. We will develop a novel solution that is practical and can quickly be brought to clinical practice.",FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring,9877188,R21EB029179,"['Abdomen', 'Academia', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Body mass index', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computers', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fruit', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Starvation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'expectation', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'mortality', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'targeted imaging', 'urolithiasis']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2020,265345,0.01496993796828413
"Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) confers elevated risk for progression to EAC. Patients diagnosed with BE undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy with biopsies to detect dysplasia which can be treated by endoscopic eradication with radiofrequency ablation before it progresses to EAC. However, the majority of diagnosed EAC patients have not had prior screening endoscopy and present with advanced lesions that limit treatment options and result in poorer survival. The development of a rapid, low cost, well tolerated, non-endoscopic BE screening technique that can be performed in unsedated patients at points of care outside the endoscopy suite would improve BE detection and reduce EAC morbidity and mortality. Our program is a multidisciplinary collaboration among investigators at the Massachusetts Institute Technology and Veteran Affairs Boston Healthcare System / Harvard Medical School that integrates novel optical imaging and software design, preclinical studies in swine, clinical studies in patients, and advanced image processing / machine learning. Aim 1 will develop an omniview tethered capsule technology that generates a map of the esophageal mucosa over a multi-centimeter length of esophagus and a series of wide angle forward views to aid navigation as the capsule is swallowed or retracted. The images will resemble endoscopic white light or narrow band imaging, but will not suffer from perspective distortion present in standard endoscopic or video capsule images. This will facilitate development of automated BE detection algorithms as well as enhance their sensitivity and specificity. This aim will also perform imaging studies in swine as a translational step toward clinical studies. Aim 2 will determine reader sensitivity and specificity for BE detection versus standard endoscopy / biopsy and prepare data for developing automated BE detection. Patients undergoing screening as well as with history of BE undergoing surveillance will be recruited and unsedated capsule imaging will be performed on the same day prior to their endoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting BE will be assessed using multiple blinded readers and data sets suitable for developing automated BE detection algorithms will be developed. Aim 3 will develop image analysis methods for automated BE detection by investigating classifiers that operate on handcrafted features (colors and textures) and modern deep convolutional neural network methods for direct classification. If successful, this program will develop a rapid, low cost and scalable method for BE screening that would not require patient sedation, endoscopy, or tissue acquisition, and which could be performed in community primary care clinics. The procedure would be much faster and many times lower cost than endoscopy. Automated BE detection would enable immediate results for patient consultation and referral to gastroenterology if indicated. Larger patient populations with expanded risk criteria could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing EAC mortality. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. The program proposes to develop an omniview tethered capsule technology, examination protocol, and automated analysis methods for low cost, rapid, well tolerated, and scalable screening in order to facilitate monitoring and timely treatment. Larger patient populations could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing mortality.","Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients",10033192,R01CA252216,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Boston', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Endoscopic Biopsy', 'Endoscopy', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Esophageal mucous membrane', 'Esophagus', 'Family suidae', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Label', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiofrequency Interstitial Ablation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening Result', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Side', 'Software Design', 'Stomach', 'Surface', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'advanced disease', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'capsule', 'clinical imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'image processing', 'imaging software', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'navigation aid', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'recruit', 'screening']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,336293,-0.014461204886962
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9903426,R01HL115828,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Sex Differences', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'aortic valve', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,747084,0.0200300196521124
"Development of a Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) Summary. Our long-term goal is to develop a powerful tool based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) for non- invasive human skin imaging in order to improve clinical diagnosis, guide effective treatment and advance clinical and cosmetic/pharmaceutical research by providing access to dynamic cellular and molecular processes during therapy. MPM is a nonlinear optical imaging technique that provides unique structural and molecular contrast based on endogenous signals such as second harmonic generation from collagen and two- photon excited fluorescence from NADH/FAD+, keratin, melanin and elastin fibers. This contrast allows MPM to provide multi-color, rich molecular information content images that can enhance diagnostic accuracy. MPM overcomes fundamental limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging and extends the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. Validation of the clinical potential of this technology has been facilitated over the past 10 years by a device developed by Jenlab in Germany, currently the only clinical MPM system on the market. This device has technical limitations in terms of field-of-view (FOV), imaging speed, complexity and cost, which are major barriers to clinical adoption. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of a MPM system that is highly optimized for rapid, label-free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution. The Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) imaging platform will incorporate the innovative optical engine of a benchtop prototype developed at BLI. InfraDerm will innovate on this design to transform it into a compact, portable device, suitable for human skin imaging in clinical setting. Key innovations include: 1) a compact engineering design based on integrating a compact fs fiber laser into the imaging head along with a customized folded optical design to reduce complexity and cost and enhance portability; 2) hardware and software strategies that include a customized patient interface and a combination of optical and mechanical scanning mechanisms with deep learning image restoration to allow millimeter-to-centimeter scale imaging within minutes while maintaining sub-micron resolution. This approach will expand the in vivo imaging area from mm to cm scale, which will be scanned within minutes with sub- cellular resolution. In Aim 1 we will develop the FLAME prototype that incorporates these features. In Aim 2 we will test its technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging by evaluating potential effects of motion artifacts. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate the FLAME system potential for non-invasive assessment of melanin content, an ability with potential impact in differential diagnosis and early assessment of treatment efficacy of pigmentary skin disorders, such as melasma. Phase II will refine the technological approach and will test the device feasibility in a first clinical application, differential diagnosis of patients with melasma, a long time dermatology challenge and a particular interest for pharma companies developing therapies for this skin condition.

The proposed Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) prototype will be highly optimized for rapid, label- free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution.

"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children.

"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,10015326,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'automated analysis', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary plaque', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,666434,0.03506227529541687
"Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee Project Abstract Motivation: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful disease that affects tens of millions of Americans, but is poorly understood, resulting in a lack of treatments. Enabling low-cost approaches for widespread study of risk factors, onset and early progression of OA will enable better understanding of OA mechanisms, treatment development, and triage of patients to different treatments based on speciﬁc disease phenotypes. Multiple systemic factors, biochemical factors, and other risk factors are associated with OA, but causes are difﬁ- cult to isolate and study during slow progression. Currently OA is diagnosed as joint-space narrowing using X-ray radiography, at a stage well beyond when interventions can be effective. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of- fers sensitivity to morphologic and biochemical changes, but most methods are impractical for widespread clinical or research use. Usually MRI exams study only one knee, precluding the opportunity to compare knees. Sim- ilarly, biomechanics assessment typically requires numerous tests using advanced and rarely-available equip- ment and time-intensive analysis by skilled personnel, making this a challenge for widespread use. We have shown rapid, simultaneous 3D scanning of both knees with quantitative relaxometry and diffusion map- ping of connective tissues, combined with novel visualization of longitudinal change validated in a population with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. We have developed fully-automated cartilage and meniscus seg- mentation to simplify post-processing. (Our automated cartilage segmentation variability approaches that of reader-to-reader variability.) We now propose to combine MRI acquisition, reconstruction and analysis tech- niques with simple measures of kinematics into a widely applicable low-cost imaging and biomechanical test, which we will validate in subjects with ACL-injury and subjects with varying Kellgren-Lawrence grades of OA. Approach: We will begin by developing a robust 5-to-8-minute bilateral knee MRI exam, using an efﬁcient 3D isotropic acquisition and novel deep-learning based image reconstructions. This will be followed with automated cartilage segmentation and quantitative analysis (thickness, T2, diffusion) of all 3 knee plates and automated semiquantitative scoring approaches for synovitis, bone marrow and cartilage lesions. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) will be used to measure kinematics, and gait asymmetries. We will continue our studies in ACL pa- tients to validate techniques and to develop asymmetry analyses for both imaging and biomechanical measures. Finally, in subjects with varying OA grade, we will evaluate the potential of the overall low-cost approach to relate asymmetry and longitudinal change measures to progression and OA grade. Signiﬁcance: This project will develop an acquisition and analysis pipeline to quantify knee changes and left/right asymmetries that precede OA. We will characterize methods in idiopathic OA subjects and ACL- injured subjects at risk of post-traumatic OA. The very low target cost, under $120/subject, will ultimately enable widespread study of early onset and progression of different OA types, leading to earlier and better treatments. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis remains the leading cause of disability, and effective treatment will require efﬁcient assessment of disease risk-factors, onset, and progression, both for development and personalization of minimally invasive interventions. We propose a 5-minute 3D MRI exam of both knees without radiation or contrast injection, that will be combined with low-cost measures of knee motion and fully automated analysis methods to provide quan- titative measurements of cartilage, tendon, ligament, bone and ﬁbrocartilage health and asymmetries between knees. This low-cost, rapid, bilateral assessment will enable research studies in large populations, as well as adding quantitative bilateral information to clinical scans to dramatically improve understanding of onset of dif- ferent types of osteoarthritis.",Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee,10032904,R01AR077604,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Articulation', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Spur', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cost Measures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Fibrocartilages', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammatory', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kellgren-Lawrence grade', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Slice', 'Surface', 'Synovitis', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'anterior cruciate ligament injury', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'gait examination', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'learning classifier', 'meniscus injury', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'sensor', 'societal costs', 'therapy development', 'tissue biomarkers']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,658342,0.011389542680738388
"A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ultimate goal is to improve our ability to create and measure 3D models derived from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Our main motivation is to improve quality and reduce costs in care of patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities. The resulted innovations will also impact other fields. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffered from CMF deformities. The evaluation of these patients includes an assessment of CMF form on 3D models that are traditionally generated from segmented spiral multi-slice CTs (MSCTs). These models are also used to plan their treatment. The purpose of segmentation is to separate different anatomical structures and to remove the artifacts on the CTs. Once 3D models are generated from the segmented CTs, anatomical and teeth landmarks are manually digitized for measurements. Finally, diagnosis and treatment planning are performed based on measurements. Although MSCT provides high- quality images and thus allows relatively fast and easy post processing, many concerns have been raised on excessive radiation exposure to patients. Therefore, more doctors are now using CBCT scanners in their offices. CBCT has less radiation and is inexpensive compared to the MSCT, but their use in generating 3D models is greatly limited by the poor image quality, i.e., low contrast / signal-to-noise ratio and artifacts. Thus, the existing automated segmentation algorithms developed for MSCT are incapable of practically segmenting CBCTs. The current solution to CBCT segmentation entails an arduous and lengthy process that involves labor-intensive manual editing of hundreds of slices. Besides, another arduous and inaccurate task in the assessment of CMF deformities is the digitization of anatomical landmarks on 3D models - the first step to quantify the deformities. Currently a typical 3D cephalometric and teeth analysis requires the manual digitization of more than 200 landmarks, which is time consuming and has limited accuracy. We hypothesize that the creation and measurement of high-quality 3D models can be significantly improved by developing innovative CBCT-friendly post processing tools. Therefore, in this renewal project, we propose to develop and validate a novel CBCT analysis platform to automate the process of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization. The feasibility of our approaches has already been proven by our preliminary studies. Our innovative CBCT analysis platform will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals with CMF conditions. It will change our dental/CMF fields in effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for on-the-fly diagnosis and treatment planning. With minimal user intervention, the computer will accurately and effectively do the work, which is currently artistically done by the labor-intensive human operators. The resulted innovations may also impact other fields in the future, e.g., orthopedic surgery and cardiovascular surgery where intraoperative whole-body CBCT is acquired for image-guided surgery and intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in physician's offices for orthodontics, craniomaxillofacial (CMF) surgery, facial plastic surgery and dentistry, but its segmentation and landmark digitization have to be completed artistically by human operators, which is labor-intensive and with limited accuracy.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative CBCT post processing system to automate the processes of CBCT segmentation and landmark digitization with minimal user intervention.  The proposed system will significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of care to the individuals  with CMF conditions, and also change 1) the fields of orthodontics, CMF surgery and general dentistry in  effectively utilizing CBCT as a guide for diagnosis and treatment planning, and 2) the fields of orthopedic  surgery, general surgery, and cardiovascular surgery where the quality and the speed of intraoperative imaging is critical.",A Novel Imaging Analysis Platform for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Deformities,9840832,R01DE022676,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Deformity', 'Dental Care', 'Dentistry', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Jaw', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Orthodontics', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Plastic Surgical Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'care costs', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'design', 'detector', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'segmentation algorithm', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual surgery']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,495143,0.010922834480668785
"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders. This project will develop a robust noninvasive imaging technique using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that offers high spatial resolution, resistance to head motion and accurate quantification of cerebral blood flow in children and adolescents.

"Development and Dissemination of Clinical CEST MRI Acquisition and Analysis Methods for Cancer Imaging Applications This research plan will continue our development of Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI acquisition and analysis methods for imaging patients with cancer. AcidoCEST MRI with an exogenous contrast agent is an innovative variation of this technique that measures extracellular pH in solid tumors. We have also developed an exceptionally innovative method that acquires endogenous CEST MR images with multiple powers, which can measure the chemical exchange rate of endogenous proteins that can assess relative differences in pH. We will improve our CEST MRI acquisition methods by accelerating the imaging speed, reducing and eliminating complications due to patient motion, eliminating complications caused by fat signal, and expanding to 3D imaging methods. We will also improve image analysis methods that are required for CEST contrast from endogenous proteins and exogenous contrast agents.  Our research has strong impact because acidoCEST MRI can track changes in tumor acidosis in response to chemotherapy and chemoradiation therapy in patients who have breast cancer and head & neck cancer. Endogenous CEST MRI can improve the diagnoses of brain tumor recurrence vs. pseudoprogression, and evaluations of lung cancer vs. lung infection. We will perform clinical studies with our endogenous and exogenous CEST MRI methods to image patients with brain, breast, lung, and head & neck cancers.  To amplify the impact of our research, we will develop versions of our CEST MRI acquisition methods for the many versions of the 13 Siemens hardware platforms and software operating systems at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. We will also develop user-friendly CEST analysis methods for many researchers at MD Anderson. We will leverage our unique research environment and expertise with intra-institutional dissemination to provide inter-institutional dissemination, by sharing share these acquisition and analysis tools with other CEST MRI researchers. We will collaborate with NIST to provide the first CEST MRI phantom that can standardize the development and implementation of intra- and inter-institutional CEST MRI methods.  Our team of outstanding investigators includes experts in CEST saturation methods, CEST MR image analysis, clinical contrast agents, rapid MRI acquisition methods, high field 7T MRI, clinical radiology, biostatistics, histopathology and oncology. Based on our expertise and years of productivity in clinical CEST MRI, we have developed an exceptional research approach. As the world's largest cancer center and a health destination, the MD Anderson Cancer Center has the patient population that provides very strong institutional support for our clinical studies. NARRATIVE We will develop new acquisition and analysis methods that assess tumor acidosis with CEST MRI, using exogenous CEST agents and endogenous sources of CEST contrast.

"Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI Project Summary: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is an impairment of urine flow from the renal pelvis into the proximal ureter and is the most common cause of hydronephrosis in neonates. This disorder is detected in up to 7% of all maternal ultrasound scans, and an estimated 10% of these newborns have hydronephrosis, which, if left untreated, may result in early failure of functional renal development in these patients. Current methods of assessing kidney function in neonates and children are less than optimal, however. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information; it is invasive, slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a method for functional imaging of kidneys that is non-invasive, safe, accurate, reproducible and radiation-free. The primary objective of this exploratory, two-year study, therefore, is two-fold: first, to develop advanced methods of motion-compensated, high spatial and temporal resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the improved quantification of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), an important marker of renal function; and second, to demonstrate the superiority of this method over the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3). Our application in response to PAR-18-743 is specifically aimed at developing, and evaluating motion-robust, high spatiotemporal resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) for quantifying GFR (MR-GFR) as well as creating new automated analysis software to enable the robust and reproducible assessment of differential renal function in newborns eliminating need for sedation, and in older children. Our method will overcome the technical challenges of current DCE-MRI techniques providing high temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function dynamics required for accurate computation of GFR, compensate for unavoidable respiratory and bulk motion to reconstruct high quality images and will provide robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate GFR computation. As a non-invasive, motion-robust, radiation-free imaging technique that can depict renal structures at much higher resolution, MR-GFR will offer, for the first time, a level of diagnostic information that is unattainable with MAG3. The critical importance of understanding the extent and severity of UPJO (and resulting hydronephrosis) cannot be understated; for in the absence of this information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgery might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment; and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., watching waiting) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. Indeed, this novel imaging approach is expected to substantially improve clinical decision-making. The successful completion of our aims will enable 1) assessment of renal function accurately; 2) predicting the likelihood of functional decline; and 3) determining whether surgery is indicated. DCE-MRI is expected to have rapid translational impact for several diseases effecting kidney function once it is introduced into clinical practice. Project Narrative: This project addresses the need to develop advanced methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess kidney function in newborns and in older children who have been diagnosed with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), an impairment of urine flow that is the most common cause of hydronephrosis (inability to void urine). Unfortunately, severe hydronephrosis, left untreated, can result in permanent damage to the child's kidneys and our novel method of assessing kidney function, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), promises to evaluate the extent of this disorder in a way that is highly accurate, non- invasive, safe, reliable, and radiation-free and will eliminate the need of repeated scans, sedation and anesthesia when imaging newborns with congenital hydronephrosis. Most importantly, this approach will enable the clinician to confidently and quickly refer children for corrective surgery based on imaging results; and likewise, recommend other children for more conservative “watchful-waiting”, effectively reducing the number of unnecessary surgeries.",Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI,9877232,R21DK123569,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age-Months', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drainage procedure', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Free Will', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gadolinium', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Hospitalization', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Lower urinary tract', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Nephrectomy', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nuclear', 'Obstruction', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pentetic Acid', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sedation procedure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Ureter', 'Ureteropelvic junction obstruction', 'Urine', 'Urology', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'care costs', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep neural network', 'functional decline', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney imaging', 'kinetic model', 'neonate', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'renal artery', 'respiratory', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'translational impact', 'urologic']",NIDDK,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,221250,0.015376683009512115
"Risk Assessment of Cerebral Aneurysm Growth with 4D flow MRI PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to determine the contribution of hemodynamic factors to risk assessment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) and calculate these factors from enhanced in vivo 4D flow MRI data. Even though most UIAs are stable, the majority of UIA patients are offered interventional treatment due to the grave risk presented if an aneurysm ruptures. Previous studies indicated that in addition to clinical (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities) and morphological (e.g., location and size) factors, UIA progression is affected by local blood flow dynamics. Hemodynamic factors associated with UIA growth can be obtained from computational and experimental models or from 4D flow MRI measurements; however, each approach has limitations. The previous NIH-funded project focused on developing image-based computational methods for predicting postoperative flow following interventions. The goal of this renewal is to use the developed framework to improve risk stratification of UIAs using image-based flow analysis. The proposed project will develop multi-parametric predictive models that combine clinical and morphological factors with hemodynamic factors calculated from augmented 4D flow MRI data. The UIA growth predicted by different models will be compared to outcomes observed in longitudinal imaging studies. The aims of the proposed project are, therefore, to: (1) determine the probability of UIA growth by utilizing morphological and clinical factors together with hemodynamic factors obtained from computational and experimental flow models by a) performing statistical analysis based on morphological and clinical factors obtained from longitudinal imaging, and b) extending statistical model by including hemodynamic factors computed from patient-specific models; (2) Enhance 4D flow MRI data by a) determining 4D flow reproducibility and variability with in vitro studies, and b) applying advanced data augmentation methods to improve the accuracy of calculated hemodynamic factors affecting aneurysm growth; (3) determine the probability of UIA growth based on multi-parametric analysis utilizing hemodynamic factors calculated from enhanced 4D flow MRI. Successful completion of the project will resolve the controversy regarding how hemodynamic factors affect aneurysm growth and establish 4D flow MRI as a diagnostic tool for UIA risk stratification. This collaborative project engages the cardiovascular engineering group at Purdue University and neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists and MRI physicists at Northwestern University, University of California San Francisco and Barrow Neurological Institute. This cross-disciplinary team will bring together experts in neurovascular surgeries, MRI velocimetry, patient-specific flow computations, experimental fluid mechanics and statistical analysis. Retrospective and prospective UIAs data obtained from these superb clinical centers will be used in this study. The outstanding engineering resources available at Purdue and world-class imaging resources at Northwestern, UC San Francisco and Barrow, as well as existing the data sharing agreements between these institutions and ongoing collaborations between the PIs, will ensure the project's success. PROJECT NARRATIVE The majority of brain aneurysms are treated, despite the fact that most of them have very low risk or rupture. Studies indicated that brain aneurysm risk factors include a range of clinical (e.g., patient’s age, sex, family history) and anatomical (e.g., aneurysm location, size and shape) parameters, as well as local blood flow dynamics. The proposed studies will determine the specific contribution of blood flow variables for improving the risk assessment of brain aneurysms and examine whether these variables can be reliably calculated from flow velocities measured with phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging.",Risk Assessment of Cerebral Aneurysm Growth with 4D flow MRI,10052679,R01HL115267,"['4D MRI', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Angiography', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Aneurysms', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cerebral Aneurysm', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'San Francisco', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Velocimetries', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'data sharing', 'enhancing factor', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neurovascular', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'residence', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'shear stress', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,707635,7.345801786964062e-05
"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop 3-D imaging flow cytometry platforms for fluorescent or absorbing (stained) cells at high resolution and high throughput in a flow configuration. The developed systems will be built upon two novel snapshot 3-D techniques developed by the PI in combination with most rigorous 3-D optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies.

"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9850978,R01EB016695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,569563,0.014227451200487686
"Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry Abstract Photon-counting CT (PCCT) is a major technological advance in CT imaging. Using photon-counting instead of current energy-integrating detectors, PCCT can offer superior performance in terms of spatial resolution, artifact reduction, and most notably, material decomposition. PCCT’s energy differentiation utility offers an ability to more precisely distinguish different materials and optimize and expand the use of contrast agents in CT. With these abilities, PCCT can significantly facilitate quantitative imaging, reduce radiation exposure, and enable revolutionary new applications in functional and physiological imaging beyond existing CT techniques. To realize the full potential of PCCT in clinical practice, the technology needs comprehensive assessments and application-based optimizations. Effective design and deployment of PCCT depends on many design and use choices that should be made in view of the eventual clinical utility. Making these choices requires large scale trials on actual patients. However, such trials are challenging, considering the need to make many decisions prior to prototyping, the limited numbers of prototype PCCT scanners available today, and the often-unknown ground-truth in the patient images. Even for existing prototype systems, many decisions require repetitive trials with multiple acquisitions. This is both unethical and impractical considering radiation safety concerns and costs. These challenges can be overcome by utilizing virtual imaging trials (VITs) using computerized patients and imaging models. VITs provide an efficient means with which to determine the most effective and optimized design and use of imaging technologies with complete control over the study design. In our prior funded project, we developed a VIT framework to evaluate standard energy-integrating detector CT technologies. In this project, we expand the applicability of this framework to photon-counting detector CT. Specifically, we enhance our computational XCAT phantoms to model the necessary higher-resolution detail including normal and abnormal tissue heterogeneities and intra-organ contrast perfusion diversity across populations (Aim 1). To image the phantoms, we develop the first PCCT simulator capable of mimicking existing and emerging prototypes (Aim 2). The enhanced VIT framework will provide the essential foundation with which to comprehensively evaluate and optimize PCCT technologies and applications. In Aim 3, we assess and optimize the use of PCCT for morphological, textural, and compositional quantification in select oncologic and cardiac applications, two leading health detriments in the US where PCCT can offer a notable impact. The results will be the first of their kind in comprehensively evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of PCCT, determining optimum dose per patient size for PCCT imaging of patients for cancerous lesions and cardiac plaque/stenoses, and helping to establish the effective utility of PCCT in clinical care. The purpose of this project is to develop and utilize a virtual framework to comprehensively evaluate and optimize emerging photon-counting devices and applications in CT imaging. The results will be the first of their kind evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of photon-counting CT and will help establish its effectual utility in oncologic and cardiac care.",Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry,10051026,R01EB001838,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Anatomy', 'Cancerous', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Imaging technology', 'Industry', 'Lesion', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Stenosis', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cardiac plaque', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'dosimetry', 'experimental study', 'human imaging', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'photon-counting detector', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual imaging']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,545403,0.032462390698369696
"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET. While the imaging developments are generally applicable to all PET tracers in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, since cancer is the primary clinical application of PET, we will focus our investigation and optimization in this project on three lung cancer imaging tracers at different clinical adoption stages as examples: 1) 18F-FDG as a routine clinical tracer, 2) 18F-FMISO for hypoxia studies as a tracer for human research, and 3) 18F-PD-L1 that specifically binds to human PD-L1 in tumors and other organs as a recent first-in-human tracer.

"Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Abstract PET is a molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology studies due to its high sensitivity and the potential of early diagnosis. For neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), 68Ga-DOTATATE PET has been recently used in clinical routine for imaging NETs in adult and pediatric patients since 2016. It plays an important role in the diagnosis and staging of NETs. However, compared to 18F-FDG PET, the image quality of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is lower due to much larger positron range, shorter half-life, and lower dose administration limited by generator capacity. All of these compromises the lesion detectability of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET, especially for small lesions, and can potentially lead to inaccurate NET diagnosis. As 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is increasingly used in clinics, there is an urgent and unmet need to further optimize 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging for NET detection. Recently, data-driven methods have been developed for PET image denoising, where the PET system model is not considered. As the tumor-to-background ratio of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is greater than 18F-FDG PET, the lesion recovery of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET can be hugely influenced by the smoothing effects as well as potential mismatches between training and testing datasets. In this study, we propose a novel data- informed and lesion detection-driven image reconstruction framework. The PET system model, image denoising module, and lesion-detection module will all be included in this reconstruction framework. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop a lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework and validate it based on comprehensive computer simulations, (2) to apply the proposed reconstruction framework to existing clinical 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT datasets and test it based on various figure-of-merits. We expect that the integrated outcome of the specific aims will be a novel and robust image reconstruction framework to better recover lesions in a 68Ga- DOTATATE PET scan, which is essential for NET managements. Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection  Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality widely used in oncology.

Individualized RTP begins with a “simulation”, in which the patient in a treatment position is commonly scanned using computed tomography (CT) to define the treatment target and organs at risk (OARs). When soft-tissue contrast is inadequate to support accurate target and OAR delineation in CT based RTP, conservatively large treatment margins are used to avoid a geometric miss. The crude treatment prevents delivering sufficient radiation dose to the tumor without exceeding the tolerance of surrounding normal tissues. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be used as a simulation platform complementary to CT for improved soft-tissue conspicuity. Yet, such a complicated, costly and tedious multi-modal RTP workflow along with unavoidable systematic MR-CT co-registration errors has limited its applications in EBRT, especially at the abdominal site whereby anatomies are highly mobile. Over the past few years, there is a keen interest in the integration of MR alone into RTP and even the therapy workflow (i.e. MR-guided radiotherapy, MRgRT). The abdomen poses critical challenges to MR simulation. Current MR imaging sequences are suboptimal to produce motion-free images and resolve respiratory motion. MR data processing for abdominal RTP is underdeveloped. Contouring of OARs typically relies on manual, tedious procedures that are time-consuming and variation-prone. In this proposal, we will substantially improve the MR acquisition and multi-organ auto-segmentation, so the potential of MR as a simulation modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal EBRT. Three specific aims will be completed. In Aim 1, we will develop a standalone multi-task MR (MT-MR) sequence dedicated to abdominal MR simulation. In Aim 2, we will optimize multi-organ auto-segmentation based on MT-MR images. In Aim 3, we will assess the performance of MT-MR in the context of pancreatic cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy planning. Successful completion of the project will dramatically improve treatment precision and clinical outcomes, thus further promoting the adoption of radiotherapy in the management of abdominal cancers. Moreover, the developed techniques will open the door to future studies aiming at optimizations in many aspects of radiotherapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Imaging is essential for precise radiation treatment planning. MR based planning is challenging in the abdomen whereby anatomies are highly mobile. We will substantially improve the MR acquisition and multi-organ auto- segmentation, so the potential of MR as an imaging-based planning modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal radiation treatment.",Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning,10053211,R01EB029088,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Abdomen', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of abdomen', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Planning Techniques', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Study Subject', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Weight', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'segmentation algorithm', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,556712,0.014569742689371694
"Enabling the Next Generation of High Performance Pediatric Whole Body MR Imaging Project Abstract Motivation: We aim to develop and implement a new approach to transform pediatric MRI. The ultimate goal is ultra-fast and motion-robust imaging in a dedicated child-friendly environment to enable more children undergo MRI without anesthesia. For those who still require anesthesia, it will be briefer and lighter, and performed in a safer environment. This project leverages a small compact magnet, designed for adult brain MRI, with gradients that enable very fast imaging. With this magnet as an outstanding starting point, we will tailor our deep experience and multiple successes in developing new MRI approaches to high-density receiver coils, fast imaging sequences, and new image reconstruction methods to set a new standard for pediatric MRI. Approach: Although the compact scanner is designed for adult heads, with a 37 cm inner diameter, it can accommodate children under eight to ten years of age to image any body part. To transform this system for ideal pediatric scanning, three development aims will be pursued. The ﬁrst is to enable optimal signal reception. This will be accomplished through creating new receive chain electronics that are matched to the gradient capabilities, for ultra-high bandwidth imaging. This will be coupled to very thin and formed receive arrays that maximize the size of the patient that can be accommodated in the small bore of the scanner. The second aim is to develop methods of obtaining the highest performance out of the system by characterizing and correcting for its imperfections. This will be coupled to a bespoke approach to peripheral nerve stimulation, enabling maximal use of the gradients on each patient. These two developments will then be leveraged for high efﬁciency and motion robust noncartesian scanning. The ﬁnal aim is to develop a full environment and infrastructure that is well suited to pediatric imaging. Patient preparation and acclimation to MRI will be enhanced by virtual reality. Support equipment for anesthesia, new physiological sensors, and a novel child-friendly audiovisual system will be created. Signiﬁcance: The result of this project will be a revolutionary change in the way that MRI is used and per- formed for children. MRI will be more available, cheaper, safer, and have markedly improved image quality. Project Narrative We will leverage the outstanding magnet and gradients of a unique small bore MRI scanner to create a new standard for unprecedented whole-body pediatric MR imaging. We will develop, integrate, and validate a set of technologies speciﬁcally for pediatric imaging. These include ultra-high bandwidth MRI signal reception from thin form-ﬁtting hardware, high-speed image data acquisition and image reconstruction, and environmental support appropriate for children.",Enabling the Next Generation of High Performance Pediatric Whole Body MR Imaging,9944392,U01EB029427,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Acclimatization', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cone', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Flare', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Infrastructure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Nerve Stimulation', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Support System', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Vendor', 'base', 'commercialization', 'contrast imaging', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pediatric patients', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'whole body imaging']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,887058,0.03691306443998002
"A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain Project Summary  In this project, we propose to validate and characterize ﬁber orientation estimation from diffusion tensor imag- ing (DTI) through the optimization of a multi-modality, multi-scale imaging pipeline for whole mouse brains. DTI is a powerful tool used to noninvasively report 3D microstructural properties of nervous tissue on a macroscopic scale, and has played an important role in the understanding and diagnosis of a number of neurological disease processes. Modern acquisitions of DTI data can be processed to generate a 3D diffusion proﬁle known as an orientation diffusion function (ODF) at each voxel. The ODF is used to infer the orientation of local axon ﬁber pop- ulations. Previous efforts to validate these orientation estimates have primarily relied on serial optical histology as a ground truth dataset. Histology-based pipelines involve the labor intensive task of physically sectioning the tissue into thin slices, leading to physical destruction of the sample and anisotropic resolution. These limitations potentially confound the accuracy of 3D orientation estimation, complicate the process of spatially registering the ground-truth and DTI datasets, and limit quantitative comparisons to select regions of interest (ROI) across the brain sample.  In recent years, synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) has emerged as a powerful tool for high-resolution tissue imaging. With a mosaic projection-stitching method, a whole mouse brain can be imaged at an isotropic, 3D resolution of 1.2 microns after prior imaging with DTI. To enhance microCT contrast, the tis- sue specimens are ﬁxed and stained with the same kind of metal-based stains used in electron microscopy (EM) prior to embedding in resin. We will optimize this microCT-EM validation pipeline to address the limitations of pre- vious histology-based studies, and characterize DTI algorithm performance across a whole mouse brain using micron- to nano-scale neurological information.  The speciﬁc aims of the proposal are: (1) model phase contrast to optimize microCT data acquisition, (2) vali- date DTI ODF reconstruction methods using ground-truth microCT (3) characterize DTI performance using under- lying tissue microstructure information from EM. Upon completion, aim 1 will generate a novel theoretical model and acquisition strategy to exploit microCT phase contrast in strongly absorbing biological samples. Aim 2 will generate a ground-truth dataset of ODFs across a whole mouse brain, which will be used to calculate algorithm- speciﬁc spatial maps of DTI performance. In Aim 3, around 20 ROI will be selected for nano-scale imaging with EM, and DTI performance will be characterized by quantitative features of the underlying neural architecture. These results will provide an unprecedented microstructure-driven understanding of the DTI signal, allowing fu- ture studies to develop more advanced DTI models and acquisition strategies to better leverage ﬁber orientation and connectivity information in the treatment of neurological disease. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to use synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography and serial electron microscopy to validate diffusion MRI reconstruction methods. This unprecedented pipeline allows for imaging the same tissue across scales ranging from hundreds of microns to tens of nanometers. The high resolution modalities will provide insight into the true neurological microstructure driving the diffusion MRI signal, leading to better modeling and increased clinical and research utility.","A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain",9987313,F31NS113571,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mus', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurologic', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plant Resins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'electron tomography', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'insight', 'interest', 'microCT', 'multimodality', 'nanometer', 'nanoscale', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'tractography', 'validation studies']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2020,40827,-0.011481202949634782
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,9927622,R01EB009690,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'data quality', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient tolerability', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,664041,0.023138680989761743
"Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Project Summary     Coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves the lives of patients with coronary disease (CAD) as a group,  but 20% of patients remain symptomatic one year after surgery. In clinical practice CABG decisions are largely  driven by stenosis severity determined from invasive angiography despite the known relevance of functional  CAD  parameters.  This  practical  impasse  will  continue  to  exist  without  clinically  available,  high-­resolution,  quantitative functional imaging, and a better understanding of the clinical outcomes in relation to anatomical  (angiography)  and  functional  (ischemia,  scar  tissue)  factors.  The  long-­term  goal  is  to  improve  outcome  of  CABG  through  personalized  imaging-­guided  care.  The  overall  objective  of  this  proposal  is  to  identify  determinants  of  myocardial  flow  restoration  (ischemia  reduction),  and  develop  integrated  imaging  tools  for  individualized,  lesion-­specific  CABG  decision-­making,  and  computational  flow  simulations  based  on  the  patient’s  anatomy  and  function  to  predict  the  hemodynamic  outcome.  Supported  by  studies  using  invasive  FFR-­guided  CABG,  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  research  is  that  integration  of  anatomical  (angiography)  and functional information (ischemia, scar tissue) will identify individual coronary vessels that will benefit from  revascularization, and individual optimization of surgical procedures by flow simulations will maximize clinical  benefit  of  CABG  for  patients  with  CAD.  Supported  by  promising  preliminary  data,  three  specific  aims  are  proposed:  1)  Prospectively  identify  angiographic,  functional  and  clinical  baseline  determinants  of  outcome  after CABG, defined as improvement of myocardial perfusion (ischemia reduction) and angina symptoms;; 2)  Develop  and  validate  a  comprehensive  imaging  strategy  and  clinically  applicable  tool  that  integrate  high-­ resolution  angiographic  and  quantitative  functional  information  (ischemia,  viability)  for  per-­vessel/lesion  revascularization  decisions;;  3)  Develop  and  validate  new  multi-­parametric  computational  flow  simulations,  with incorporation of functional imaging data, which allows for prediction of individual hemodynamic outcome  and  ultimately  surgical  optimization  based  on  virtual  hemodynamic  results.  This  approach  is  innovative  because  new  imaging  techniques  will  advance  the  field’s  understanding  of  CABG  physiology,  and  new  clinically applicable tools will be developed for comprehensive clinical decision-­making and optimized surgical  planning. The acquired knowledge and developed tools are applicable to other vascular contexts, and may  also  be  instrumental  for  new  therapeutic  innovations.  The  proposed  research  is  significant  because  identification  of  CABG  outcome  determinants,  and  new  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance,  have  the  potential  to  improve  the  effectiveness  (by  complete  functional  revascularization)  and  efficiency  of  CABG  (by  avoiding  futile  grafts).  For  a  large  group  of  patients,  these  innovations  will improve  the patient-­valued  benefit  of  CABG (complications, symptoms),  and also decrease  cost by improved efficiency of care.     Project Narrative    The proposed research is relevant to the public health because identification of CABG outcome determinants,  and  development  of  diagnostic  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance  of  CABG  surgery,  can  help  achieve  complete  functional  revascularization  and  restoration  of  myocardial  blood  flow  in  more  patients.  Thus,  the  proposed  research  is  relevant  to  the  NIH’s  mission  that  pertains  to  the  discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of  that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. ",Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery,9869041,R01HL141712,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intuition', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity -

"Permeability Imaging using Simultaneous Dynamic PET and Arterial Spin Labeling MRI Abstract Candidate's Career Goals: Dr. Han has a strong background in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, image reconstruction and arterial spin labeling (ASL), with a Ph.D. in bio and brain engineering. Dr. Han is currently at a junior-faculty rank of instructor at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). His goal is to expand his future career to multi-modality positron emission tomography (PET)-MR imaging for translational research and clinical improvement. His long-term goal is to become an independent, accomplished investigator that can lead future scientific and clinical imaging projects taking full advantage of multi-modality PET-MR imaging. Career Development Plan: Foundational training in PET/PET-MR imaging as well as neurology is proposed for the candidate, an area that the candidate currently lacks knowledge and experience in. The candidate plans to engage in formal course work/seminars, research via one-on-one instructions with mentors and collaborators, conferences/presentations, manuscript/grant preparations, and teaching/leadership roles to grow as an independent investigator in the field of PET-MR imaging and neurology. Research Project: The overall goal of the proposed research is to take advantage of simultaneous dynamic PET and ASL-MR imaging to estimate the permeability surface product (PS) of the PET tracer, which is new physiological information that cannot be obtained with PET or MR alone. PS describes the unidirectional flux rate of macromolecules from the blood plasma into the interstitial space of cellular tissue and is the key metric for assessing the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Knowing the PS of the PET tracer provides powerful capability to probe the physiological delivery process of essential macromolecules involved in the pathogenesis of diseases in relation to BBB, due to the theoretically unlimiting potential in the design of radioactive analogs of important biological compounds. We plan to develop a PET tracer PS mapping method, achieve the first phantom and human study with PS mapping, and study the changes in the spatial distribution of tau neurofibrillary tangles (tau) and amyloid-beta (Aß) plaque depositions in relation to the BBB integrity changes with pathological events associated with the progression of AD, by performing dynamic-PET/mPLD-ASL studies using 18F-T807 and 11C- Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET tracers on AD and normal subjects. Environment: MGH provides an ideal setting for conducting research in MR, PET, and PET-MR imaging since multiple state-of-the-art imaging systems are available for preclinical/clinical MR scanners and preclinical simultaneous PET-MR scanners. There is a dynamic flow phantom designed to simulate blood flow for two compartment pharmacokinetics and an MR-compatible pump and detection system for continuous blood sampling suitable for performing ASL flow and PET imaging studies with arterial sampling. Also, there is a shared memory supercomputer ideal for the image reconstruction proposed in the project. MGH is also home to many experts in both PET-MR imaging and neurology who can provide their expertise to this project.

"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly. This project will develop automated tools to increase measurement throughput, and explore new image-based biomarkers that will significantly add to the assessment of patient prognosis, and will have the ability to more quickly judge the effectiveness of interventions.",Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD,10011565,K01DK110136,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'FarGo', 'Fibrosis', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Tissue', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Spin Labels', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Writing', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'educational atmosphere', 'functional decline', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'kidney vascular structure', 'knowledge base', 'novel imaging technology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'prognostic value', 'radiological imaging', 'renal artery', 'research study', 'shear stress', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K01,2020,154915,0.027022288502870057
