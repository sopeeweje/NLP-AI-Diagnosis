"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,9776678,R44AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Family', 'Floor', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Series', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'care costs', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'frontier', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'trend', 'web portal']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2019,493633,0.3831061969850053
"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination.

"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,9724645,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2019,190538,0.34019426457593677
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9785384,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2019,158220,0.27457293611495076

Narrative The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR project is to extend the impact of SafelyYou Guardian, a real- time fall detection system using off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. SafelyYou Guardian is an online fall detection system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL). In Phase I, this Fast Track SBIR project will perform a first trial to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to- stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real-time fall detection on blurred video. We want to demonstrate that sit-to-stand detection can remove the need for bed alarms; that passive gait monitoring will enable identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and that applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, through a 280-patient trial, we will examine clinical outcomes of the system using a waitlist randomized control study. We want to demonstrate that when compared to standard- of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. The project leverages a 100-patient population in our 11 partner facilities (assisted living and skill nursing), recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots.

"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9559625,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2018,156568,0.27457293611495076
"Real-time video monitoring of falls in memory-care facilities for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementias In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the  top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent  hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the  activities of daily living. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase  quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a  fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices  require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of  showing caregivers how falls occur.  Our goal is to deploy and demonstrate NestSense (also known as SafelyYou), an online fall detection  system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to passively detect falls for patients with AD and  related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL will confirm the fall  detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms. We will demonstrate it for 100  patients in 13 memory care facilities. Memory care facilities can select parameters that matter for  specific patients; for ex., some patients wake up frequently during the night while others should  be assisted when they attempt to leave the bed at night. It does not require action of individuals  / caregivers such as wearing a fall pendant and is therefore well-suited for individuals with ADRD.  We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence)  approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will  call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The human can monitor  several facilities at a given time.  This project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 13 memory care facilities,  recruited through our previous (IRB approved) pilot. The work will leverage our previous three  pilots. • Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting a proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. • Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility from  the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to  clinical benefits including a reduction of falls from 13 and 11 in the first 2 months to 2 in the  final month, due to video review with care staff. • Pilot 3 (ongoing): We demonstrated scalability and further acceptance by deploying the system in  13 facilities of the Carlton, Integral Senior Living, Pacifica and SRG networks, totaling 100  patients already monitored by our system (offline). The pilot proposed for this SBIR Phase I will translate the 100 cameras in these facilities into a  real-time fall detection system which will run online for 3 months with a 24/7 HIL support.  Compared to a 3-month baseline from the 100 cameras recording with the detection offline, we  hypothesize this real-time detection system will lead to a statistically significant reduction in  time on the ground after a fall, fall related hospitalizations, and length of hospital stay  following fall incidents based on results described in previous clinical trials with 150+  participants [8,14]. The proposed NestSense system uses off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to perform detection of  safety-critical events for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia patients in memory care  facilities. It does not rely on active use from the patients or caregivers (e.g., through wearing  any kind of device). The NestSense technology provides the first robust non-wearable fall detection  tuned specifically to the privacy-security tradeoffs of dementia care. It provides an answer to  today’s technology gaps (far from 100% reliability) by use of a Human-in-the Loop (HIL) paradigm to  enable a quick rollout of the technology. Following the acceptance of privacy safety tradeoffs of  our system by patients, family, and memory care staff in the Carlton, Integral Senior Living,  Pacifica and SRG networks, we have deployed the system in offline mode in 13 facilities of the  network, monitoring 100 patients. The research, implementation, and deployment work encompassed in  this SBIR Phase I will provide validation that the existing prototype can be rolled out to a proof  of concept, operational in real-time mode, with HIL, to reduce fall-related hospitalizations and  time spent on the ground. The pilot follows 3 previous pilots, the most recent of which deploys  cameras with these 100 patients in offline mode to study the effect on the fall rate of  occupational therapist review of fall video in memory care. This study will translate those cameras  into a real-time fall (online) detection system which will run online for 3 months with a 24/7 HIL  support. Compared to a 3-month baseline from the cameras recording with the detection offline, we  hypothesize this real-time detection system will lead to a statistically significant reduction in  time on the ground after a fall, fall related hospitalizations, and length of hospital stay  following fall incidents based on previous clinical trials with 100+ participants [8,14].",Real-time video monitoring of falls in memory-care facilities for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementias,9465622,R43AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Event', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Managed Care', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Scheduling and Staffing', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'falls', 'human-in-the-loop', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'success', 'time use', 'willingness']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R43,2017,150000,0.36203323025714174

"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9341305,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'portability', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'stroke survivor', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2017,166794,0.4172284369415954
"Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Richard D. Boyce, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has training in informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research as well as a strong commitment to improving medication safety for older adults. His prior work has focused on artificial intelligence methods for predicting drug-drug interactions and the comparative safety of antidepressants for treating de-pressed nursing home residents. The current proposal is for a three year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that will address gaps in his knowledge of aging research and the nursing home setting. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Charles Reynolds, Jordan Karp, and Steven Handler) he has developed a training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on how to effectively translate research results from pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research to informatics interventions that improve medication safety for older adults, especially nursing home residents. To accomplish this goal, he proposes eight career development activities and two research aims that will help him 1) obtain rigorous training in the science and practice of creating clinical decision support interventions that are effective in the nursing home setting; 2) obtain a thorough understanding of how falls and fall risk factors are detected, monitored, reported, and assessed in the nursing home setting; and 3) learn the perceptions of multiple nursing home clinician stakeholders on what research is needed to help reduce medication-related adverse events. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by exploring the feasibility and potential clinical usefulness of actively monitoring patients exposed to psycho- tropic PDDIs. The approach would use electronic data available in most United States (US) NHs to provide highly specific and actionable alerts to physicians and/or nurses when a resident who is exposed to a PDDI involving a psychotropic drug transitions to a state of unacceptably high risk for experiencing a fall. Dr. Boyce's hypothesis is that this approach will extend the ability of NH clinicians to perform the recommended ""diligent monitoring"" of PDDIs, while avoiding alert fatigue. He anticipates that the approach would be generalizable to other prevalent NH ADEs (e.g., delirium) and other drug classes (e.g., mood stabilizers). This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore an innovative approach to managing PDDIs that may ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). It wil also inform an R-series grant proposal to study a mature intervention that Dr. Boyce plans to submit in year 2 of the project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will impact public health by providing quantitative and qualitative pilot data that will inform the design of an intervention that should ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). The work will also provide a solid research basis for future active monitoring interventios targeting a broader set of PDDIs and other adverse events (e.g., delirium) prevalent in the NH setting.",Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr,8974794,K01AG044433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Detection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Group Interviews', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness research', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'hypnotic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prototype', 'sedative', 'therapy design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2016,113592,0.1584947996026815

"Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Richard D. Boyce, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has training in informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research as well as a strong commitment to improving medication safety for older adults. His prior work has focused on artificial intelligence methods for predicting drug-drug interactions and the comparative safety of antidepressants for treating de-pressed nursing home residents. The current proposal is for a three year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that will address gaps in his knowledge of aging research and the nursing home setting. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Charles Reynolds, Jordan Karp, and Steven Handler) he has developed a training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on how to effectively translate research results from pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research to informatics interventions that improve medication safety for older adults, especially nursing home residents. To accomplish this goal, he proposes eight career development activities and two research aims that will help him 1) obtain rigorous training in the science and practice of creating clinical decision support interventions that are effective in the nursing home setting; 2) obtain a thorough understanding of how falls and fall risk factors are detected, monitored, reported, and assessed in the nursing home setting; and 3) learn the perceptions of multiple nursing home clinician stakeholders on what research is needed to help reduce medication-related adverse events. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by exploring the feasibility and potential clinical usefulness of actively monitoring patients exposed to psycho- tropic PDDIs. The approach would use electronic data available in most United States (US) NHs to provide highly specific and actionable alerts to physicians and/or nurses when a resident who is exposed to a PDDI involving a psychotropic drug transitions to a state of unacceptably high risk for experiencing a fall. Dr. Boyce's hypothesis is that this approach will extend the ability of NH clinicians to perform the recommended ""diligent monitoring"" of PDDIs, while avoiding alert fatigue. He anticipates that the approach would be generalizable to other prevalent NH ADEs (e.g., delirium) and other drug classes (e.g., mood stabilizers). This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore an innovative approach to managing PDDIs that may ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). It wil also inform an R-series grant proposal to study a mature intervention that Dr. Boyce plans to submit in year 2 of the project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will impact public health by providing quantitative and qualitative pilot data that will inform the design of an intervention that should ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls).

"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.        This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests). The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling.

"Continuous Fall Risk Monitoring System: Walking vs Activities of Daily Living    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to U.S. emergency departments and the primary etiology of accidental deaths in persons over the age of 65 years1. Interventions such as physical therapy, adjusting medications, or behavior changes can reduce the elderly fall rate2. Fall risk determination is needed to identify who may benefit from interventions. Changes in fall risk may occur suddenly or gradually, and are more likely to become apparent in the home environment as an individual goes about their normal activities of daily living (ADLs) rather than during a limited and periodic care provider assessment. Consequently, a continuous, all-in-one system that would monitor elderly individuals in the home for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls is needed to reduce falls in the elderly. To be effective, the monitoring device must be non-intrusive and socially acceptable. The long-term goal of this project is to [extend an existing non-intrusive, commercially available monitoring system capable of location tracking, physiologic monitoring, and alerting to also assess fall risk in real time; the system would consider factors such as frequent bathroom use, fitful sleep and changes in gait characteristics]. The monitor for the proposed research has a watch form factor, is worn at the wrist, and has demonstrated high acceptance rates by elderly users. Research has shown that abnormal gait is indicative of fall risk, leading to the use of a variety of measurements of gait in fall risk determinations. To analyze gait from data gathered during ADLs, it is necessary to differentiate periods of walking, which can then be analyzed for abnormal characteristics. The purpose of this Phase I proposal is to test the [feasibility of using tri-axial acceleration data gathered from a commercially available wrist monitor to recognize periods of walking. Walking data can then be used in conjunction with other system data to] make inferences about changes in fall risk. Thirty elderly (aged 65 and over), ambulatory volunteers residing in an independent living facility will be recruited. The volunteers will be asked to engage in normal ADLs while being monitored over a 4-hour time period. During the study, volunteers will be videotaped, monitored using the wrist device, and monitored using a body-area sensor network technology developed at the University of Virginia. The specific aims of this project will be to: 1) determine if it is feasible to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using the presence of frequencies generally associated with walking in wrist- gathered acceleration data as the differentiator, 2) determine whether individuals typically demonstrate a narrower range of walking frequencies than that suggested for the entire population, and 3) determine if it is feasible to use machine learning and time-series techniques to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using characteristics learned from walking and non-walking data.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651. In order to reduce the number of falls, a continuous, non-intrusive, convenient monitoring system in an acceptable form factor which will monitor elderly individuals in their home environment for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls needs to be developed. The long-term goal of this project is to develop such a system; the proposed project would take the necessary step of identifying and differentiating between walking and other normal activities [so that data gathered during walking can be used to recognize changes in stability for an individual, and then can be used in conjunction with other system data already being automatically collected in real-time to recognize an increased probability of falling both during walking or other activities.]           Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651.

The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests).

"Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Falls among the elderly, one of the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions, are a major health problem. Several studies have identified quantifiable gait markers that appear to distinguish between elderly ""fallers"" and non-fallers. These studies have relied on data acquired in gait-laboratories. Extending gait assessment capability, and falls detection, into the home could provide valuable before-the-fact information on gait weakness evolution, which in turn could be used to assess the efficiency of counter measures. Current mobile gait analysis techniques are insufficient because they rely on compliance or are too intrusive. The development of a new gait assessment and falls monitor is proposed. The device is passive and obtains gait data from sensing floor vibrations as well as a minimally invasive wireless device, precluding the need to walk on special surfaces or be observed by cameras. This study's principal aim is to validate the device's performance through a comparison with accepted gait assessment techniques at the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Gait lab at the University of Virginia Health System   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents. Fall-related injuries are among the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and are a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions. The cost of falls to the national economy is significant. In 1994 the total cost due to falls was estimated to be $20.2 billion. This number is expected to climb to $32.2 billion by 2020. One suggestion for reducing the number of falls has been the creation of a fall risk assessment for institutional residents, an important component of which is gait assessment. In view of the results obtained during the Phase I effort, it appears that the floor sensor system may be able to answer a well defined need for which there is presently no other solution that promises to be as readily implementable and for which the market potential is significant.           Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring Notice Number: NOT-OD-10-034) Notice Title: NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications for Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Transfer Technology Research Grants (R43/R44 and R41/R42) through the NIH Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents.

"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,10020322,R44AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Family', 'Floor', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Series', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'care costs', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'frontier', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'memory care', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'trend', 'web portal']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2020,493633,0.3831061969850053

We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data.

In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective.

"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination.

"electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS). ABSTRACT Recent meta-analyses have found that participation in the appropriate fall-prevention exercise program for an older adult reduces the risk of falls by 23% in relative terms, for an absolute reduction of 0.20 falls per person per year. Many guidelines, including the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), recommend that older adults at risk of falls are referred to appropriate fall-prevention exercise programs (USPSTF Level B). Despite this evidence, many older adults do not receive appropriate referrals and support for fall-prevention exercises, with one study finding that less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). Older people living in rural areas are more likely to fall but are less likely to participate in fall prevention programs. Advances in computing technology can help to identify older people at risk of falls and disseminate guidance about the most effective interventions using clinical decision support (CDS) systems. Patients can be supported in their exercise programs through a patient-focused App distributed through the PCP or through content on their patient portal. Well-implemented CDS that is integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) can support prescribing or recommending effective strategies and engaging patients in fall prevention decision-making thus integrating evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice. The long-term goal of our research program is to enhance the safety of community-based older adults by reducing falls through an effective patient-centered learning health system called eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS). With eSTEPS, an exercise algorithm will be integrated into the EHR which will trigger a Best Practice Alert (BPA) and Smart Set to provide actionable CDS within primary care clinic workflows and facilitate the use of CDS with patients to ensure evidence-based recommendations are tailored to patient preferences. The resulting fall prevention exercise care plan will be sent to the EHR as a note and to a patient-facing App for the patient to view after their visit. In this proposal we will use traditional fall risk screening and machine learning approaches to accurately identify older adults at risk for falls. We will then develop, CDS implemented into the electronic health record that helps primary care providers and older patients develop a tailored fall prevention exercise plan. We will conduct a cluster randomized control trial in urban and rural primary care clinics to test the efficacy of the eSTEPS CDS intervention. Development of the eSTEPS CDS within the widely adopted Epic EHR will support dissemination of evidence for older adults, with a focus on rural elders. NARRATIVE There is substantial evidence that conducting multifactorial fall risk assessments and developing personalized prevention plans in primary care settings can reduce falls, but many barriers exist to integrating this evidence into practice. The US Preventive Service Task Force recommends fall prevention exercises for community- dwelling adults who are at increased risk for falls, however less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). The goal of this project is to develop, test, and evaluate shareable, standards-based fall prevention clinical decision support, eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS) that can used by primary care providers to facilitate personalized activity and exercise prescriptions and reduce falls in at risk older adults.",electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS).,10049339,R61AG068926,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Prevention Guidelines', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Screening procedure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavior change', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'exercise prescription', 'exercise program', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'patient portal', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'rural area', 'screening', 'smartphone Application', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R61,2020,250020,0.2614418173412986
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,10007879,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2020,156859,0.27457293611495076
"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,10009334,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'medical attention', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2020,229404,0.34019426457593677
"Sense4Safety: Supporting socially vulnerable older adults Abstract Falls and fall-related injuries are significant public health issues for adults 65 years of age and older. Over a third of older adults (OA) fall each year and 10-20% of falls result in serious injuries such as fractures and head trauma. The annual direct medical costs in the US as a result of falls are estimated to exceed $50 billion, and this estimate does not include the indirect costs of disability, dependence, and decreased quality of life. This project targets community dwelling OA with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are socially vulnerable. MCI is a leading risk factor for falls in OA. Approximately 15%-20% of OA have MCI, and over 60% of OA with MCI fall annually – two to three times the rate of those without cognitive impairment. Socially vulnerable OA living in low-resource neighborhoods with poor housing conditions have twice the risk of falling. We have developed an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk. The purpose of this study is to refine the Sense4Safety intervention based on extensive feedback by low income OA with MCI, their family members or trusted others and clinicians in order to ensure that the passive monitoring system to predict fall risk for OA with MCI can generate actionable and tailored information that can be used effectively by these stakeholder groups.
