"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Summary The goal of this project is to develop a smartphone-based wayfinding app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate indoor environments more easily and independently. It harnesses computer vision and smartphone sensors to estimate and track the user's location in real time relative to a map of the indoor environment, providing audio-based turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to a desired destination. An additional option is to provide audio or tactile alerts to the presence of nearby points of interest in the environment, such as exits, elevators, restrooms and meeting rooms. The app estimates the user's location by recognizing standard informational signs present in the environment, tracking the user's trajectory and relating it to a digital map that has been annotated with information about signs and landmarks. Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings.

"SCH: INT: Conversations for Vision: Human-Computer Synergies in Prosthetic Interactions  The project will investigate prosthetic support for people with visual impairment (PVI) that integrates computer vision-based prosthetics with video-mediated human-in-the-loop prosthetics. Computer vision- based (CV) prosthetics construe the fundamental technical challenge for visual prosthetics as one of parsing and identifying objects across scales, distances, and orientations. Visual prosthetic applications have been central drivers in the development of computer vision technology through the past 50 years. Video-mediated remote sighted assistance (RSA) prosthetics are more recent, enabled by different technologies, and construe the orienting technical challenge for visual prosthetics as one of effective helping interactions. RSA services are commercially available now, and have evoked much excitement in the PVI community. The two approaches, CV and RSA, will be successively integrated through a series of increasingly refined Wizard of Oz simulations, and investigate possible synergies between the two approaches. We will employ a human-centered design approach, identifying a set of key assistive interaction scenarios that represent authentic needs and concerns of PVIs, by leveraging our 6-year relationship working directly with our local chapter of the National Federation of the Blind. RELEVANCE (See Instructions): 23.7 million American adults have vision loss; 1.3 million people in US are legally blind. This project addresses a transformational opportunity to enhance human performance and experience, to diversify workplace participation, and to enhance economic and social well-being. n/a",SCH: INT: Conversations for Vision: Human-Computer Synergies in Prosthetic Interactions ,9928587,R01LM013330,"['Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'Articulation', 'Back', 'Blindness', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Information Sciences', 'Instruction', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Ocular Prosthesis', 'Performance', 'Prosthesis', 'Route', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Services', 'Social Well-Being', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Underrepresented Students', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'human-in-the-loop', 'learning materials', 'legally blind', 'outreach', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'synergism', 'undergraduate student']",NLM,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2019,225147,0.03094394719676798
"Vision in Natural Tasks Summary/Abstract  In the context of natural behavior, humans make continuous sequences of sensory-motor decisions to satisfy current behavioral goals, and vision must provide the information needed to achieve those goals. The proposed work examines gaze and walking decisions in locomotion in outdoor environments, taking advantage of our novel system for measuring combined eye and body movements in these contexts. Currently we have only limited understanding of the constituent tasks in natural locomotion, or the requisite information, and the proposal attempts to specify these.  in the context of natural gait, the patterns of optic flow are unexpectedly complex, raising questions about its role. The patterns of motion on the retina during locomotion depend critically on both eye and body motion, and these in turn depend on behavioral goals. Our first Aim is therefore to comprehensively describe the statistics of retinal motion patterns in a variety of terrains and task contexts. We will measure binocular eye and body movements while walking in outdoor terrains of varying roughness, crossing a busy intersection, and making coffee. These contexts will induce different gaze patterns. We will provide a comprehensive description of the motion stimulus in natural locomotion and help separate out self-motion signals from externally generated motion. These data will allow a more precise specification of the response patterns in cortical motion sensitive areas. Because of the complexity of natural motion patterns, we will re-examine the influence of optic flow on walking direction in a virtual reality environment and test alternative explanations for the role of flow.  A central task in walking is foot placement, and we will focus on identifying the image properties that make a good foothold. Stereo, structure from motion, and spatial image structure are all likely contenders. We directly investigate the role of stereo in foothold selection by examining gait patterns in stereo-deficient subjects in terrains with varying degrees of roughness. Using a different strategy, we will attempt to predict gaze locations and footholds in rough terrain using convolution neural nets (CNN’s) to identify potential search templates for footholds in rough terrain. We will describe fixation patterns from crosswalk and sidewalk navigation and attempt to make inferences about their purpose, and use Modular Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MIRL) to predict direction decisions and decompose the behavior into sub-tasks.  The collection of integrated gaze, body kinematics, and scene images in a range of natural environments is innovative, as little comparable data exists The work will be strengthened by the investigation of stereo- deficient subjects for whom there is almost no integrated eye and body data. Since much of the work in robotics has no visual input at all this should help in development of visual guidance for robots and also help better define the necessary information for individuals with impaired vision. The data set will be made publicly available. Project Narrative  The central goal of this work is to understand vision in its natural context. This is very important information in order to devise suitable vision aids and rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual impairments, and it is becoming increasingly accessible because of developments in technology for monitoring eye and body movements.

"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users’ independence by responding to them without another person’s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user’s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user’s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes. This technology enables continuous access to communication, maintains one’s ability to drive a wheelchair and allows a person to drink or suction themselves, providing good hydration, respiratory health and hygiene.",Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions,9750520,R44HD093467,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Hydration status', 'Hygiene', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lighting', 'Logic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Research Design', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Saliva', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Speech', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Suction', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tube', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Variant', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'body system', 'commercialization', 'communication device', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'manufacturability', 'meetings', 'product development', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'research and development', 'respiratory health', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"BLUE SKY DESIGNS, INC.",R44,2019,507856,0.0774538317306292
"Annual meeting of the Vision Sciences Society: Travel grants for junior investigators PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Vision Sciences Society is a nonprofit membership organization of nearly 2000 scientists interested in the functional aspects of vision. VSS was founded in 2001 with the purpose of bringing together scientists from a broad range of disciplines including visual psychophysics, visual neuroscience, computational vision and visual cognition. The scientific content of the meetings reflects the breadth of topics and interconnected ideas and approaches in modern vision science, from visual coding to perception, recognition and the visual control of action, as well as recent developments in cognitive psychology, computer vision and neuroimaging. Since its founding, VSS has provided a forum and framework for communicating advances in vision science, and VSS has become a flagship conference for the field. The interdisciplinary nature of VSS is reflected in the deliberately diverse membership of the Board of Directors and Abstract Review Committee, and by its formal relationship with the more clinically-oriented Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology. Many of the faculty from institutions in the United States who attend VSS are principal investigators of National Eye Institute grants; hence, the research objectives of the programs of the National Institutes of Health and of the National Eye Institute are well-represented in the program planning and individual presentations. Over 60% of participants are predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees. Of these 55% are US citizens. VSS provides multiple career development opportunities: (1) the platform and poster presentations provide a forum for trainees to showcase their work and receive feedback, (2) career-development workshops cover topics such as “Getting that Faculty Job”, “Reviewing and Responding to Reviews”, “The Public Face of your Science”, “Careers in Industry and Government”, “Faculty Careers at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions”, and include panel discussions with journal editors, NIH and NSF grant officers, and academic and industry representatives, (3) a “Meet the Professors” event in which trainees meet in small groups with members of the VSS Board and other professors for free-wheeling, open-ended discussions, and (4), a partnership with ARVO through which trainees from one society can carry out research or attend the meeting of the other. Informally, VSS provides opportunities for networking with peers and senior colleagues in a comfortable and engaging setting. The large contingent of early-stage investigators at VSS is a sign of the strong health of the field and the opportunity VSS provides for advancing the field. Our goal is to facilitate access and participation for this next generation of vision scientists. The purpose of this grant is to provide 35 travel awards (5 for ARVO affiliates) for early-career investigators to attend the 2019 meeting, with the focus on attracting and supporting a diverse pool of pre- doctoral students, postdoctoral trainees, and pre-tenure faculty who demonstrate potential for future success as vision researchers and whose research findings will be presented at the meeting. Funds are also requested to support childcare services for awardees and workshops and social events for all early-career participants. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Vision Science Society (VSS) organizes an annual meeting for presenting cutting edge research on the mechanisms and principles of normal and abnormal visual perception. The aging American population will experience an increasing rate of visual loss due to diseases and disorders of the eye and central visual pathway.

"Development of a computer-guided orthopedic laser surgical system – vision & measurement Spatial Surgical is developing a novel, first-in-class orthopedic laser system that rapidly and safely ablates soft tissue and bone through a single handpiece. Spatial’s technology couples a laser with a real-time digital video system to offer computer-guided surgery that stands to replace traditional orthopedic saws, drills, and cauterization tools. The digital 3D video system is two miniaturized CMOS-based cameras built into the laser hand- piece. By eliminating mechanical tools an unobstructed, intra-operative view of the surgical site is possible for the first time ever. In-between the laser pulses, the cameras flash to capture an unobstructed view of the surgical site. The dual cameras are connected to a 3D display. Advances in autostereoscopic 3D displays have eliminated the need for 3D glasses, referred to as “glasses-free”, and enabled wide angle viewing. 3D viewing of the surgical area promotes increased spatial understanding of complex/ambiguous scenes and enhances surgical efficiency (McIntire 2014). Coupling image recognition software with the 3D vision enables AI measurement and computer assisted navigation. Orthopedic surgical success, measured as less patient pain and fewer revisions, has been shown when measurement and navigation are used, but existing systems are expensive and slow. A laser surgical hand-piece coupled with HD 3D vision and measurement will enable more accurate implant placement and restored range of motion while reducing infections and decreasing surgical times. This SBIR program models, tests, and demonstrates 3D viewing including digital zoom. Initially a multi-element design is modeled to predict what lens assembles would match with the digital CMOS imager appropriate for the orthopedic HD 3D application. Secondly off-the-shelf, OTS, lens stacks are chosen based on the optical modeling, and are tested to define the balance between the FOV, focal length, object distance and image size. Lens stack stereo characteristics are recorded and subsequently derive the forward-looking design requirements. Additionally, various illumination levels are explored to determine the optimum lighting for each lens stack. A standard vision calibration chart, like Mil-Std-150A, is used for alignment and the edge response is used to define spatial resolution. Multiple bone cut samples are measured with a confocal microscope and then viewed in 2D with the various OTS lens stacks. Optical measurement software is used to process the OTS lens camera images and are graphed versus the microscope data to determine peak image performance for spatial resolution. The introduction of HD autostereoscopic monitors and high pixel count CMOS global imagers enable a 3D surgical vision system to aid in orthopedic surgical applications by providing 3D glasses-free and wide angle viewing to improve spatial understanding of joints for faster and more precise surgery.",Development of a computer-guided orthopedic laser surgical system – vision & measurement,9846664,R43AR075447,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Budgets', 'Calibration', 'Cauterize', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Surgery', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Couples', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'Fracture', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Implantation procedure', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'base', 'bone', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'lens', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'preservation', 'programs', 'response', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'solid state', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIAMS,SPATIAL SURGICAL LLC,R43,2019,246510,0.0177067207030826
"Naturalistic Data Collection In The SmartPlayroom PROJECT SUMMARY The aims of this proposal are to fully develop and validate the SmartPlayroom as a powerful automated data collection and analysis tool in developmental research. This room looks like any playroom in a home or school but is designed to naturalistically collect data in real time and simultaneously on all aspects of children's behavior. Behaviors include movement kinematics, language, eye movements, and social interaction while a child performs naturalistic tasks, plays and explores without instruction, walks or crawls, and interacts with a caregiver. The space is equipped with mobile eye tracking, wireless physiological heart rate and galvanic skin response sensors, audio and video recording, and depth sensor technologies. Funding is requested to demonstrate the scientific advantage of naturalistic measurement using an example from visual attention research (Aim 1), and in the process, to provide data to further develop flexible computer vision algorithms for automated behavioral analysis for use in 4-9 year-old children (Aim 2). By combining fine-grained sensor data with high-throughput automated computer vision and machine learning tools, we will be able to automate quantitative data collection and analysis in the SmartPlayroom for use in addressing myriad developmental questions. The SmartPlayroom approach overcomes completely the limitations of task-based experimentation in developmental research, offering quantitative precision in the collection of ecologically valid data. It has the power to magnify both construct validity and measurement reliability in developmental research. The investigators are committed to making freely available our data, computer vision algorithms, and discoveries so that we might move the field forward quickly. NARRATIVE We focus this work on developing and validating a novel and innovative data collection space called the SmartPlayroom, designed to pair naturalistic exploration and action with the precision of computerized automated data collection and analysis.

"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Summary The goal of this project is to develop a smartphone-based wayfinding app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate indoor environments more easily and independently. It harnesses computer vision and smartphone sensors to estimate and track the user’s location in real time relative to a map of the indoor environment, providing audio-based turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to a desired destination. An additional option is to provide audio or tactile alerts to the presence of nearby points of interest in the environment, such as exits, elevators, restrooms and meeting rooms. The app estimates the user’s location by recognizing standard informational signs present in the environment, tracking the user’s trajectory and relating it to a digital map that has been annotated with information about signs and landmarks. Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings.

"Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor Summary The principal goal of this proposal is to increase the accuracy and precision of a low-cost autorefraction device called the QuickSee, in order to improve access to refractive eye care for underserved populations. Poor vision due to a lack of eyeglasses is highly prevalent in low-resource settings throughout the world and significantly reduces quality of life, education, and productivity. The existing QuickSee only extracts the lower- order aberration information contained within a wavefront profile of the eye, to roughly estimate an eyeglass prescription. This proposal will further improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device by exploiting both the lower- and higher-order aberrations contained within the complete wavefront. To realize this goal, we will enroll 300 subjects (600 eyes) in Baltimore, MD, and will obtain subjective refraction and visual acuity (VA) measurements and will use machine learning on this large dataset of wavefront profiles to optimize the wavefront-to-refraction algorithm of the QuickSee device. The main output of this project will be a robust and improved-accuracy next-generation QuickSee device that will increase efficiency of and decrease the training requirements of eye care professionals, and potentially dispense refractive correction that provides similar or better VA than correction from an eye care professional. Successful completion of this work will be an important step towards dramatically improving eyeglass accessibility for health disparity populations in the USA and internationally in low-resource settings. Upon completion of this proposal, we will apply for a Phase II award proposing to work with Wilmer Eye Institute research faculty to assess widespread deployment of the next-generation QuickSee with minimally-trained personnel in order to accurately and reliably provide thousands of pairs of low-cost corrective eyeglasses to underserved communities. Project Narrative This project proposal seeks to develop a novel technology that will disruptively increase the accessibility of refractive eye care for health disparity populations in low-resource settings. Specifically, sophisticated algorithms will be developed that improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device so that it can improve the efficiency of and reduce the training barriers for eye care professionals, and potentially provide refractive correction without the need for refinement by a trained eye care professional. Our goal is to develop a low- cost, easy-to-use, scalable solution to increase accessibility to vision correction globally.","Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor",9711194,R43EB024299,"['Algorithms', 'Award', 'Baltimore', 'Brazil', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Status', 'Enrollment', 'Eye', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guatemala', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'India', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Mali', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Optometrist', 'Output', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Refractive Errors', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'faculty research', 'health care disparity', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'lens', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'success', 'vector']",NIBIB,"PLENOPTIKA, INC.",R43,2018,99914,0.03916403943972357
"A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device ABSTRACT This project will create the first objective measurement tool, the VisBox, for the vision subtype of concussion (VSC). This will enable physicians to identify VSC without an eye-care professional, for referral to a vision specialist for personalized vision therapy recommendations. The persistence of concussion symptoms beyond several weeks is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, and children are particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties. A lack of accessible, objective vision diagnostics are critical barriers to identification of VSC and referral for treatment. The VisBox will be a software product that is used with the OcuTracker, Oculogica’s proprietary eye-tracking hardware platform. The VisBox will input eye movement measurements from the OcuTracker, calculate metrics that correspond to aspects of cranial nerve function affected during a concussion, and use those metrics to calculate a score to predict VSC using an algorithm developed with guided machine learning in the course of this study. The VisBox will be used by non- vision specialists to objectively measure three vision disorders related to concussion: convergence insufficiency (CI), accommodative insufficiency (AI), and saccadic dysfunction (SD) in under 4 minutes, during the clinical visit where the concussion is diagnosed. The long-term goal is to develop an objective assessment of vision characteristics, that will enable physicians that are non-specialists in vision to 1) screen for concussion-related vision disorders; 2) identify VSC; 3) make decisions about the necessity of a referral for a comprehensive vision examination; 4) monitor the effectiveness of vision treatment. Phase I Hypothesis. VisBox can produce an output score that correlates with the presence or absence of TBI- related vision disorder, i.e., VSC, by leveraging the OcuTracker visual stimulus and eye tracking system. Specific Aim I. Generate OcuTracker eye tracking data and the diagnosis of TBI-related vision disorder in 250 pediatric concussion patients. Specific Aim II. Develop and validate VisBox algorithm for assessing CI, AI, and SD using OcuTracker data. Plans for Phase II. The VisBox score will be used to predict responsiveness to vision therapy in a prospective randomized clinical study. Phase II will be a multi-armed study comparing vision therapy with placebo therapy in concussion patients and assessing whether the VisBox software can predict which patients are responsive to vision therapy. Commercial Opportunity. VisBox customers are non-eye care specialists including neurologists, pediatricians, emergency room physicians, sports medicine physicians, and concussion specialists. The total addressable market is $400M, assuming 4M annual scans at $100/scan needed for concussions in the US. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT At least 4 million concussions occur in the US each year, and up to 30% of these injuries persist beyond 4 weeks in a condition known as persistent post-concussion symptoms, which is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, with children particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties – with often serious consequences. The lack of an accessible, objective vision diagnostics presents a critical barrier to identification of the vision disorder concussion sub-type (VSC) and referral for treatment.

"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions Project Summary/Abstract People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users’ independence by responding to them without another person’s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user’s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user’s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. Project Narrative People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes. This technology enables continuous access to communication, maintains one’s ability to drive a wheelchair and allows a person to drink or suction themselves, providing good hydration, respiratory health and hygiene.",Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions,9644103,R44HD093467,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Hydration status', 'Hygiene', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lighting', 'Logic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Research Design', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Saliva', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Speech', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Suction', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tube', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Variant', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'body system', 'commercialization', 'communication device', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'manufacturability', 'meetings', 'product development', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'research and development', 'respiratory health', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"BLUE SKY DESIGNS, INC.",R44,2018,519349,0.07758423979213717
"Insightful Surgical Vision Technology (ISVision) for intelligent real-time display of anatomic, physiologic, and pathologic information in surgery Abstract Intelligent intraoperative display of anatomic and physiologic information coupled to real time situational awareness to critical tissues will benefit all surgery. The current surgical vision is limited to naked human eyes in open surgery or more recently using laparoscopic digital imaging for minimally invasive surgery and robot assisted surgery. In laparoscopic vision, although the visualization of surface anatomy and tissue physiology in the surgical field-of-view has been enhanced by recent advances in optical imaging technology, the imaging paradigm still remains passive and still poses a significant challenge due to the inherent narrow peripheral vision and limited depth perception. We propose the next generation laparoscopic vision system that provides intelligent display of unrecognized tissue structures to human eyes. Our proposed use of a new paradigm and surgical vision technology (called ISVisionTM), equipped with modular plenoptic 3-D Color/HD camera and snapshot NIR hyperspectral imager, will permit a clear visualization of the critical target tissue-of-interest, surrounding anatomy into the operative field, and situational awareness for both the tool and tissue to the surgeon. Our Phase I effort comprises of engineering the clinically viable ISVision platform and testing the performance of its intraoperative use. Specifically, the ISVision system will clearly and precisely identify different tissue characteristics, accurately displaying physiologic information including tissue perfusion and blood flow. Following the Phase 1, we anticipate undertaking a Phase II project, during which we will develop a clinical grade ISVision system and investigate its performance and utility in the operating room. While the initial focus of the Phase I and II effort is on the complex surgery such as liver resection due to crucial nature of critical sub-surface structures located underneath liver hilum and parenchyma, the ISVision system will potentially play an enabling role in all surgeries and establish it as a vital component of the operating room of the future. Narrative Real-time display of the accurate anatomic and tissue physiology during surgery is necessary and crucial in improving surgical outcomes. This proposal aims to develop the next generation surgical vision system that provides intelligent display of unrecognized, unseen tissue structures to human eyes. The current state of the art technology still remains passive, focuses on anatomic display only. A new surgical vision technology, called ISVisionTM, will provide clear display of important anatomic structures, identify not only their distinct shape and position, and offer insightful intelligent function during surgical procedures. The academic partner in this proposal has developed a novel research prototype and has shown that the new imaging tool can enhance surgical vision beyond human visibility for preclinical testing. The small business partner backed by a Venture company from the Bay area has a strong background for successful commercialization. Together, we aim to convert the academic research prototype into a clinically viable market product that will significantly improve the safety, function, and outcome of surgery, not limited by surgeons’ visual perception, training or experience.

"Psychophysics of Reading - Normal and Low Vision DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychophysics of Reading - Normal and Low Vision Abstract Reading difficulty is one of the most disabling consequences of vision loss for five million Americans with low vision.  Difficulty in accessing print imposes obstacles to education, employment, social interaction and recreation.  The ongoing transition to the production and distribution of digital documents brings about new opportunities for people with visual impairment.  Digital documents on computers and mobile devices permit easy manipulation of print size, contrast polarity, font, page layout and other attributes of text.  In short, we now hae unprecedented opportunities to adapt text format to meet the needs of visually impaired readers.  In recent years, our laboratory and others in the vision-science community have made major strides in understanding the impact of different forms of low vision on reading, and the dependence of reading performance on key text properties such as character size and contrast.  But innovations in reading technology have outstripped our knowledge about low-vision reading.  A major gap still exists in translating these laboratory findings into methods for customizing text displays for people with low vision.  The broad aim of the current proposal is to apply our knowledge about the impact of vision impairment on reading to provide tools and methods for enhancing reading accessibility in the modern world of digital reading technology.  Our research plan has three specific goals:   1) To develop and validate an electronic version of the MNREAD test of reading vision, to extend this technology to important text variables in addition to print size, and to develop methods for customizing the selection of text properties for low-vision readers.  MNREAD is the most widely used test of reading in vision research and was originally developed in our laboratory with NIH support.  2) To investigate the ecology of low-vision reading in order to better understand how modern technologies, such as iPad and Kindle are being used by people with low vision.  We plan to evaluate the feasibility of using internet methods to survey low-vision individuals concerning their reading behavior and goals, and of collecting approximate measures of visual function over the internet.  We also plan to develop an ""accessibility checker"" to help low-vision computer users and their families to evaluate the accessibility of specific text displays.  3) To enhance reading accessibility by developing methods for enlarging the visual span (the number of adjacent letters that can be recognized without moving the eyes).  A reduced visual span is thought to be a major factor limiting reading in low vision, especially for people with central-field loss from macular degeneration.  We have already demonstrated methods for enlarging the visual span in peripheral vision.  We plan to develop a more effective perceptual training method for enlarging the visual span, with the goal of improving reading performance for people with central-vision loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reading difficulty is one of the most disabling consequences of vision loss for five million Americans with low vision.  The ongoing transition to the use of digital documents on computers and mobile devices brings about new opportunities for customizing text for people with visual impairment.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.  We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, o perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment.  Our goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals, including those with physical disabilities and to enhance safety for older people and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions.  We plan to develop a computer-based design tool enabling architectural design professionals to assess the visual accessibility of a wide range of environments (such as a hotel lobby, subway station, or eye-clinic reception area).  This tool will simulate such environments with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or hazards, such as steps or benches, for different levels and types of low vision, and for spaces varying in lighting, surface properties and geometric arrangement.  Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives:  ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments."" Our research plan has three specific goals:  1) Empirical:  determine factors that influence low-vision accessibility related to hazard detection and navigation in real-world spaces.  2) Computational:  develop working models to predict low vision visibility and navigability in real-world spaces.  3) Deployment:  translate findings from basic vision science and clinical low vision into much needed industrial usage by producing a set of open source software modules to enhance architectural and lighting design for visual accessibility.  The key scientific personnel in our partnership come from three institutions:  University of Minnesota -- Gordon Legge and Daniel Kersten; University of Utah -- William Thompson and Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University -- Robert Shakespeare.  This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the necessary areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility -- empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), computer graphics and photometrically accurate rendering (Thompson & Shakespeare) and architectural lighting design (Shakespeare).  We have collaborative arrangements with additional architectural design professionals who will participate in the translation of our research and development into practice.

"NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of this proposal is to conduct research on the foundational models and algorithms in computer vision and machine learning for an egocentric vision based active learning co-robot wheelchair system to improve the quality of life of elders and disabled who have limited hand functionality or no hand functionality at all, and rely on wheelchairs for mobility. In this co-robt system, the wheelchair users wear a pair of egocentric camera glasses, i.e., the camera is capturing the users' field-of-the-views. This project help reduce the patients' reliance on care-givers. It fits NINR's mission in addressing key issues raised by the Nation's aging population and shortages of healthcare workforces, and in supporting patient-focused research that encourage and enable individuals to become guardians of their own well-beings.  The egocentric camera serves two purposes. On one hand, from vision based motion sensing, the system can capture unique head motion patterns of the users to control the robot wheelchair in a noninvasive way. Secondly, it serves as a unique environment aware vision sensor for the co-robot system as the user will naturally respond to the surroundings by turning their focus of attention, either consciously or subconsciously. Based on the inputs from the egocentric vision sensor and other on-board robotic sensors, an online learning reservoir computing network is exploited, which not only enables the robotic wheelchair system to actively solicit controls from the users when uncertainty is too high for autonomous operation, but also facilitates the robotic wheelchair system to learn from the solicited user controls. This way, the closed- loop co-robot wheelchair system will evolve and be more capable of handling more complicated environment overtime.  The aims ofthe project include: 1) develop an method to harness egocentric computer vision-based sensing of head movements as an alternative method for wheelchair control; 2) develop a method leveraging visual motion from the egocentric camera for category independent moving obstacle detection; and 3) close the loop of the active learning co-robot wheelchair system through uncertainty based active online learning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The project will improve the quality of life of those elders and disabled who rely on wheelchairs for mobility, and reduce their reliance on care-givers. It builds an intelligent wheelchair robot system that can adapt itself to the personalized behavior of the user. The project addresses the need of approximately 1 % of our world's population, including millions of Americans, who rely on wheelchair for mobility.",NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair,9133939,R01NR015371,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conscious', 'Detection', 'Disabled Persons', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Hand functions', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Subconscious', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Visual Motion', 'Wheelchairs', 'aging population', 'base', 'improved', 'operation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'robot control', 'sensor']",NINR,STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,133916,0.07839305930588546
"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,9215686,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'student training', 'teaching assistant', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2017,59383,0.025067402034120494
"Naturalistic Data Collection In The SmartPlayroom PROJECT SUMMARY The aims of this proposal are to fully develop and validate the SmartPlayroom as a powerful automated data collection and analysis tool in developmental research. This room looks like any playroom in a home or school but is designed to naturalistically collect data in real time and simultaneously on all aspects of children's behavior. Behaviors include movement kinematics, language, eye movements, and social interaction while a child performs naturalistic tasks, plays and explores without instruction, walks or crawls, and interacts with a caregiver. The space is equipped with mobile eye tracking, wireless physiological heart rate and galvanic skin response sensors, audio and video recording, and depth sensor technologies. Funding is requested to demonstrate the scientific advantage of naturalistic measurement using an example from visual attention research (Aim 1), and in the process, to provide data to further develop flexible computer vision algorithms for automated behavioral analysis for use in 4-9 year-old children (Aim 2). By combining fine-grained sensor data with high-throughput automated computer vision and machine learning tools, we will be able to automate quantitative data collection and analysis in the SmartPlayroom for use in addressing myriad developmental questions. The SmartPlayroom approach overcomes completely the limitations of task-based experimentation in developmental research, offering quantitative precision in the collection of ecologically valid data. It has the power to magnify both construct validity and measurement reliability in developmental research. The investigators are committed to making freely available our data, computer vision algorithms, and discoveries so that we might move the field forward quickly. NARRATIVE We focus this work on developing and validating a novel and innovative data collection space called the SmartPlayroom, designed to pair naturalistic exploration and action with the precision of computerized automated data collection and analysis.

"User-driven fitting of hearing aids and other assistive hearing devices Hearing aids are the principal tool today for ameliorating age-related hearing loss and its significant social, cognitive and functional costs to patients and society at large. However, many individuals who are prescribed hearing aids do not use them at all, or use them only occasionally. Most reasons behind the “hearing aid in the drawer” phenomenon relate to the characteristics of the sound produced, and could, in theory, be addressed with the correct signal processing strategy. The problem persists despite the increased complexity and power of new devices, for three reasons: (a) The hearing aid parameters, as set in the clinic, introduce distortion or render audible many sounds that the hearing impaired user had become accustomed to not hearing. The novelty is often so uncomfortable for the user as to discard the device. (b) The optimum parameters vary depending on the listening task and environment. Under some conditions, a device with parameters designed for a different condition will perform worse than no device at all. (c) The clinical fitting is derived from a non-ideal way to assess auditory function (the pure- tone audiogram). The optimum parameters for the actual impairment may be different from those of the prescribed fitting. Although it is true that the physiological mechanisms make it impossible to process sound so as to completely reverse the effect of sensorineural hearing loss, a device that delivers some benefit at all times is likely to be used all the time. The goal is to develop a hearing aid that can adaptively change its parameters to address the problems above, and will be accomplished with a novel fitting approach that rapidly presents a number of parameter settings to the user and lets the user guide the system toward the optimal settings for each listening situation. This requires the development of machine-learning algorithms to effectively search the parameter space and user interface devices and instructions that are easy for the patient to use. The focus of this Phase I proposal is the development of the algorithms and the adaptive user-driven fitting program, and to compare the proposed fitting with the traditional audiogram-based fitting across measures of functional hearing (ability to recognize speech in noise) and subjective preference. A hearing aid user is often dissatisfied with the sound quality of their device, despite its sophistication and adjustment by a trained audiologist. The problem can be mitigated by letting the user fine-tune the device for maximum comfort in everyday use. We will apply modern machine learning methods to develop a program for efficient user-driven fitting of hearing assistive devices.",User-driven fitting of hearing aids and other assistive hearing devices,9409910,R43DC016251,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Back', 'Books', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Music', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Presbycusis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'social', 'sound', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDCD,"CARAWAY SOFTWARE, INC.",R43,2017,224966,-0.0019140708117104557
"Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor Summary The principal goal of this proposal is to increase the accuracy and precision of a low-cost autorefraction device called the QuickSee, in order to improve access to refractive eye care for underserved populations. Poor vision due to a lack of eyeglasses is highly prevalent in low-resource settings throughout the world and significantly reduces quality of life, education, and productivity. The existing QuickSee only extracts the lower- order aberration information contained within a wavefront profile of the eye, to roughly estimate an eyeglass prescription. This proposal will further improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device by exploiting both the lower- and higher-order aberrations contained within the complete wavefront. To realize this goal, we will enroll 300 subjects (600 eyes) in Baltimore, MD, and will obtain subjective refraction and visual acuity (VA) measurements and will use machine learning on this large dataset of wavefront profiles to optimize the wavefront-to-refraction algorithm of the QuickSee device. The main output of this project will be a robust and improved-accuracy next-generation QuickSee device that will increase efficiency of and decrease the training requirements of eye care professionals, and potentially dispense refractive correction that provides similar or better VA than correction from an eye care professional. Successful completion of this work will be an important step towards dramatically improving eyeglass accessibility for health disparity populations in the USA and internationally in low-resource settings. Upon completion of this proposal, we will apply for a Phase II award proposing to work with Wilmer Eye Institute research faculty to assess widespread deployment of the next-generation QuickSee with minimally-trained personnel in order to accurately and reliably provide thousands of pairs of low-cost corrective eyeglasses to underserved communities. Project Narrative This project proposal seeks to develop a novel technology that will disruptively increase the accessibility of refractive eye care for health disparity populations in low-resource settings. Specifically, sophisticated algorithms will be developed that improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device so that it can improve the efficiency of and reduce the training barriers for eye care professionals, and potentially provide refractive correction without the need for refinement by a trained eye care professional. Our goal is to develop a low- cost, easy-to-use, scalable solution to increase accessibility to vision correction globally.","Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor",9312420,R43EB024299,"['Algorithms', 'Award', 'Baltimore', 'Brazil', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Status', 'Enrollment', 'Eye', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guatemala', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'India', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Mali', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Optometrist', 'Output', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Refractive Errors', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'faculty research', 'health care disparity', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'lens', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'success', 'vector']",NIBIB,"PLENOPTIKA, INC.",R43,2017,200225,0.03916403943972357
"Capti Screen Reading Assistant for Goal Directed Web Browsing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Web browsing with assistive technologies such as screen readers and magnifiers can often be a frustrating and challenging experience for people with vision impairments, because it entails a lot of searching for content, forms, and links that are required for doing online tasks such as shopping, bill-payment, reservations, etc. This SBIR Phase II project will build on Phase I results and will continue the development and eventual deployment of Capti Screen Reading Assistant - a next-generation assistive technology, enabling goal- directed web browsing for people with visual impairments. With Capti Assistant, users will be able to stay focused on their high-level browsing goals that are expressed in natural language (spoken or typed). The Assistant will lead the users step-by-step towards the fulfillment of these goals by offering suggestions on what action to take at every step of the way and automatically executing the chosen action on behalf of the user. Suggested actions will include operations such as form filling, activating controls (e.g., clicking buttons and links), et. Capti Assistant will dramatically reduce the time spent by people with visual impairments on performing tasks online. The Assistant will significantly improve the speed and efficiency with which they can interact with the Web, thereby, making people with disabilities more productive in today's web-based economy. Given a user browsing goal, expressed in a natural-language form, Capti Assistant will utilize a predictive model to guide the user toward the goal. The unique aspect of the Assistant is that its suggestions will be automatically learned from the user's own history of browsing actions and commands, as well as from the user's demonstration of how to accomplish browsing tasks that have not been done before. The Assistant will process user commands and present the suggested browsing actions to the user on demand, giving the user a choice between following the suggestions or continue browsing normally without accepting the suggestions. The functionality offered by the Assistant will go far beyond popular personal assistant applications such as Siri, which have not been designed specifically for people with vision impairments, and which cannot be used for ad hocweb browsing. Capti Assistant will go a long way towards bridging the growing web accessibility divide between the ways people with and without vision impairments browse the Web. For them, the Assistant will usher in a new era of independence and employability in our global web-based economy. Thus, from a broader perspective, goal- directed browsing will exemplify the vision of the Universally Accessible Web whose thesis is ""equal access for all"", i.e. anyone should be able to reap the benefits of the Web without being constrained by any disability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This SBIR Project seeks to do Research and Development on goal-directed web browsing - the next generation accessible technology that will empower people with vision impairments to stay focused on their high-level browsing goals, while the browser will do low-level operations (such as clicking on links and filling forms) necessary to fulfill these goals. Goal-directed browsing will go a long way towards bridging the growing web accessibility divide between the ways people with and without vision impairments browse the web, thus improving independence and employability of the former in our global Web-based economy.

"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions Project Summary/Abstract People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users’ independence by responding to them without another person’s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user’s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user’s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. Project Narrative People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes. This technology enables continuous access to communication, maintains one’s ability to drive a wheelchair and allows a person to drink or suction themselves, providing good hydration, respiratory health and hygiene.",Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions,9407137,R44HD093467,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Hydration status', 'Hygiene', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lighting', 'Logic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phonation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Research Design', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Saliva', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Speech', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Suction', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tube', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Variant', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'body system', 'commercialization', 'communication device', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'meetings', 'product development', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'research and development', 'respiratory health', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"BLUE SKY DESIGNS, INC.",R44,2017,159267,0.07758423979213717
"Psychophysics of Reading - Normal and Low Vision DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychophysics of Reading - Normal and Low Vision Abstract Reading difficulty is one of the most disabling consequences of vision loss for five million Americans with low vision.  Difficulty in accessing print imposes obstacles to education, employment, social interaction and recreation.  The ongoing transition to the production and distribution of digital documents brings about new opportunities for people with visual impairment.  Digital documents on computers and mobile devices permit easy manipulation of print size, contrast polarity, font, page layout and other attributes of text.  In short, we now hae unprecedented opportunities to adapt text format to meet the needs of visually impaired readers.  In recent years, our laboratory and others in the vision-science community have made major strides in understanding the impact of different forms of low vision on reading, and the dependence of reading performance on key text properties such as character size and contrast.  But innovations in reading technology have outstripped our knowledge about low-vision reading.  A major gap still exists in translating these laboratory findings into methods for customizing text displays for people with low vision.  The broad aim of the current proposal is to apply our knowledge about the impact of vision impairment on reading to provide tools and methods for enhancing reading accessibility in the modern world of digital reading technology.  Our research plan has three specific goals:   1) To develop and validate an electronic version of the MNREAD test of reading vision, to extend this technology to important text variables in addition to print size, and to develop methods for customizing the selection of text properties for low-vision readers.  MNREAD is the most widely used test of reading in vision research and was originally developed in our laboratory with NIH support.  2) To investigate the ecology of low-vision reading in order to better understand how modern technologies, such as iPad and Kindle are being used by people with low vision.  We plan to evaluate the feasibility of using internet methods to survey low-vision individuals concerning their reading behavior and goals, and of collecting approximate measures of visual function over the internet.  We also plan to develop an ""accessibility checker"" to help low-vision computer users and their families to evaluate the accessibility of specific text displays.  3) To enhance reading accessibility by developing methods for enlarging the visual span (the number of adjacent letters that can be recognized without moving the eyes).  A reduced visual span is thought to be a major factor limiting reading in low vision, especially for people with central-field loss from macular degeneration.  We have already demonstrated methods for enlarging the visual span in peripheral vision.  We plan to develop a more effective perceptual training method for enlarging the visual span, with the goal of improving reading performance for people with central-vision loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reading difficulty is one of the most disabling consequences of vision loss for five million Americans with low vision.  The ongoing transition to the use of digital documents on computers and mobile devices brings about new opportunities for customizing text for people with visual impairment.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.  We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, o perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment.  Our goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals, including those with physical disabilities and to enhance safety for older people and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions.  We plan to develop a computer-based design tool enabling architectural design professionals to assess the visual accessibility of a wide range of environments (such as a hotel lobby, subway station, or eye-clinic reception area).  This tool will simulate such environments with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or hazards, such as steps or benches, for different levels and types of low vision, and for spaces varying in lighting, surface properties and geometric arrangement.  Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives:  ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments."" Our research plan has three specific goals:  1) Empirical:  determine factors that influence low-vision accessibility related to hazard detection and navigation in real-world spaces.  2) Computational:  develop working models to predict low vision visibility and navigability in real-world spaces.  3) Deployment:  translate findings from basic vision science and clinical low vision into much needed industrial usage by producing a set of open source software modules to enhance architectural and lighting design for visual accessibility.  The key scientific personnel in our partnership come from three institutions:  University of Minnesota -- Gordon Legge and Daniel Kersten; University of Utah -- William Thompson and Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University -- Robert Shakespeare.  This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the necessary areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility -- empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), computer graphics and photometrically accurate rendering (Thompson & Shakespeare) and architectural lighting design (Shakespeare).  We have collaborative arrangements with additional architectural design professionals who will participate in the translation of our research and development into practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.

"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,9021663,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'exercise program', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'student training', 'teaching assistant', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2016,59383,0.025067402034120494
"Capti Screen Reading Assistant for Goal Directed Web Browsing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Web browsing with assistive technologies such as screen readers and magnifiers can often be a frustrating and challenging experience for people with vision impairments, because it entails a lot of searching for content, forms, and links that are required for doing online tasks such as shopping, bill-payment, reservations, etc. This SBIR Phase II project will build on Phase I results and will continue the development and eventual deployment of Capti Screen Reading Assistant - a next-generation assistive technology, enabling goal- directed web browsing for people with visual impairments. With Capti Assistant, users will be able to stay focused on their high-level browsing goals that are expressed in natural language (spoken or typed). The Assistant will lead the users step-by-step towards the fulfillment of these goals by offering suggestions on what action to take at every step of the way and automatically executing the chosen action on behalf of the user. Suggested actions will include operations such as form filling, activating controls (e.g., clicking buttons and links), et. Capti Assistant will dramatically reduce the time spent by people with visual impairments on performing tasks online. The Assistant will significantly improve the speed and efficiency with which they can interact with the Web, thereby, making people with disabilities more productive in today's web-based economy. Given a user browsing goal, expressed in a natural-language form, Capti Assistant will utilize a predictive model to guide the user toward the goal. The unique aspect of the Assistant is that its suggestions will be automatically learned from the user's own history of browsing actions and commands, as well as from the user's demonstration of how to accomplish browsing tasks that have not been done before. The Assistant will process user commands and present the suggested browsing actions to the user on demand, giving the user a choice between following the suggestions or continue browsing normally without accepting the suggestions. The functionality offered by the Assistant will go far beyond popular personal assistant applications such as Siri, which have not been designed specifically for people with vision impairments, and which cannot be used for ad hocweb browsing. Capti Assistant will go a long way towards bridging the growing web accessibility divide between the ways people with and without vision impairments browse the Web. For them, the Assistant will usher in a new era of independence and employability in our global web-based economy. Thus, from a broader perspective, goal- directed browsing will exemplify the vision of the Universally Accessible Web whose thesis is ""equal access for all"", i.e. anyone should be able to reap the benefits of the Web without being constrained by any disability.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This SBIR Project seeks to do Research and Development on goal-directed web browsing - the next generation accessible technology that will empower people with vision impairments to stay focused on their high-level browsing goals, while the browser will do low-level operations (such as clicking on links and filling forms) necessary to fulfill these goals. Goal-directed browsing will go a long way towards bridging the growing web accessibility divide between the ways people with and without vision impairments browse the web, thus improving independence and employability of the former in our global Web-based economy. From a broader perspective, goal-directed browsing will facilitate rehabilitation of people with disabilities and exemplify the vision of the Universally Accessible Web whose thesis is ""equal access for all"", enabling anyone to reap the benefits of the Web without being constrained by any disability.        ",Capti Screen Reading Assistant for Goal Directed Web Browsing,9048176,R44EY021962,"['Automation', 'Blindness', 'Budgets', 'Businesses', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FarGo', 'Focus Groups', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'In Situ', 'Information Retrieval', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Reservations', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Scheme', 'Seasons', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'collaborative environment', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'computer human interaction', 'design', 'disability', 'educational atmosphere', 'empowered', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'query optimization', 'research and development', 'response', 'success', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'usability', 'web page', 'web-accessible']",NEI,"CHARMTECH LABS, LLC",R44,2016,500000,0.07156575425356972
"NRI: Small: A Co-Robotic Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project's objective is to develop enabling technology for a co-robotic navigation aid, called a Co-Robotic Cane (CRC), for the visually impaired. The CRC is able to collaborate with its user via intuitive Human-Device Interaction (HDl) mechanisms for effective navigation in 3D environments. The CRCs navigational functions include device position estimation, wayfinding, obstacle detection/avoidance, and object recognition. The use of the CRC will improve the visually impaired's independent mobility and thus their quality of life. The proposal's educational plan is to involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project, and use the project's activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision methods that support accurate blind navigation in 3D environments and intuitive HDl interfaces for effective use of device. These methods include: (1) a new robotic pose estimation method that provides accurate device pose by integrating egomotion estimation and visual feature tracking; (2) a pattern recognition method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model that may recognize indoor structures and objects for wayfinding and obstacle manipulation/ avoidance; (3) an innovative mechanism for intuitive conveying of the desired travel direction; and (4) a human intent detection interface for automatic device mode switching. The GPU implementation of the computer vision methods will make real-time execution possible. The proposed blind navigation solution will endow the CRC with advanced navigational functions that are currently unavailable in the existing blind navigation aids.

"NRI: A Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid for the Visually Impaired PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The objective of the proposed research is to develop new technology for a Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid (W-ROMA) for the visually impaired. The W-ROMA is a hand-worn assistive device that provides assistance to a visually impaired individual in effectively grasping an object. Thanks to the onboard computer vision methods, the W-ROMA is capable of detecting a target object, determining the hand-object misalignment, and conveying to the wearer, via natural human-device interfaces, the desired hand motion for hand-object alignment. The W-ROMA will contribute to the independent lives of the visually impaired in twofold: First, it helps the visually impaired with independent travel by enabling them to identify a movable obstacle and manipulate the obstacle to make a passage. Second, it assists the visually impaired in effectively grasping an object for non-navigational purpose. The PIs will involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project and use the proposed project activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision and human-robot interaction methods that support accurate and effective object grasping for the visually impaired for their independent daily lives. These methods include: (1) a new real-time object recognition method; (2) an innovative hand-object alignment mechanism; (3) a novel hybrid tactile display system for object shape rendering; and (4) a computationally efficient device localization method. The proposed solutions can be encapsulated in a hand-worn robotic device. The W-ROMA will provide new co-robotic functions for the visually impaired. The PIs have performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision and tactile display methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the research will positively impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the proposed methods can be applied to other small robotic systems that have a wide range of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the PI's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.

"Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-invasive medical devices are fast emerging as powerful tools in providing quantitative, simple to parse data in assessing the health and wellness of users. These devices can provide information feedback to users on their state of health, and can potentially provide valuable real-time insight to doctors on the links between user consumption and activity on their respective health. Recently described epidermal electronics / multifunctional tattoos introduced from our lab and others have demonstrated sensing of biopressure, bioelectricity, analyte concentration, bacteria, and more. These structures potentially represent the evolution of wearable devices as they possess a negligible form factor and conform to any surface (such as skin or teeth), minimizing user impact. These devices also bypass more traditional, ""wearable"" gadgets that often require bulky mechanical fixtures or straps, require complex microfluidic systems or integrated electronics, cannot provide dynamic readout, and cannot be disposed of easily. Dielectric sensors are a class of structures that are able to probe the composition of a biofluid via their impedance spectrum, and can be configured for remote sensing via radio waves. These devices can be composed of isolated, thin film circuits, and are directly amenable to epidermal or tattoo formats. This measurement methodology is inherently tremendously powerful, as it can potentially measure multiple analytes at once by probing multiple resonance peaks, and can potentially be piggybacked onto existing RFID infrastructure for data readout. However, these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated, and under real-world applications dielectric sensors have often proven difficult to use. This is often due to simplistic readout (devices will directly correlate a single metric such s the real value of the impedance at a frequency to a biomarker) and are thus can be sensitive from user to user or to environmental conditions. Herein, the applicant will leverage the expertise and knowledge of the labs of Dr. Omenetto and colleagues to bring practical usability to these dielectric antennas, bridging the gap between laboratory measurement and real-time, and real-world health monitoring applications. The end-goal is to generate disposable, skin and teeth-mounted, dielectric sensors to remotely probe the presence of biomarkers in sweat, saliva, and potentially blood to draw definitive links between user nutrition and their health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to create non-invasive, wireless sensor tattoos to be tagged onto the human body for probing the composition of saliva, sweat, or blood. These wireless sensors would present negligible impediment to the user, and would require next to no upkeep to maintain, potentially facilitating an unprecedented level of subject data collection and dissemination. Such data could yield conclusive links between diet, activity, biomarkers, and public health.            ","Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition",9148070,F32EB021159,"['Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Electronics', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human body', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Nafion', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radio', 'Radio Waves', 'Reader', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Saliva', 'Silk', 'Skin', 'Sodium', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Sweat', 'Sweating', 'System', 'Tattooing', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Urea', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'World Health', 'bioelectricity', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'enzyme activity', 'flexibility', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'insight', 'non-invasive monitor', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'real world application', 'remote sensing', 'response', 'saliva composition', 'sensor', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,F32,2016,47190,0.025003494077538973

We propose to advance our previously developed low-cost, handheld device capable of automatically measuring the optical properties of the eye based on the technique of wavefront aberrometry.  The  proposed  work  will  specifically  focus  on  the development of optical and software systems will extend the device's measurement  range  to  work  on  a  larger  range  of  refractive  errors.  First,  optical  systems  with  no  moving  parts  will  be  developed  which  enable  the  device  to  work  on  subjects  with  severe  myopia  or  hyperopia  (<-­-6  diopters or  >6  diopters  of  refractive  error).  Second,  algorithms  that  make  the  device  easy  and  intuitive  to  use  will  be  implemented.  Third,  a  handheld  prototype  incorporating  these  improvements  will  be  constructed  and  validated  in  model  eye  systems.

"Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes new technology development and user studies aiming to facilitate the use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for blind people. Mobile OCR systems, implemented as smartphones apps, have recently appeared on the market. This technology unleashes the power of modern computer vision algorithms to enable a blind person to hear (via synthetic speech) the content of printed text imaged by the smartphone's camera. Unlike traditional OCR, that requires scanning of a document with a flatbed scanner, mobile OCR apps enable access to text anywhere, anytime. Using their own smartphones, blind people can read store receipts, menus, flyers, business cards, utility bills, and many other printed documents of the type normally encountered in everyday life. Unfortunately, current mobile OCR systems suffer from a chicken-and-egg problem, which limits their usability. They require the user to take a well-framed snapshot of the document to be scanned, with the full text in view, and at a close enough distance that each character can be well resolved and thus readable by the machine. However, taking a good picture of a document is difficult without sight, and thus without the ability to look at the scene being imaged by the camera through the smartphone's screen. Anecdotal evidence, supported by results of preliminary studies conducted by the principal investigator's group, confirms that acquisition of an OCR-readable image of a document can indeed by very challenging for some blind users. We plan to address this problem by developing and testing a new technique of assisted mobile OCR. As the user aims the camera at the document, the system analyzes in real time the stream of images acquired by the camera, and determines how the camera position and orientation should be adjusted so that an OCR-readable image of the document can be acquired. This information is conveyed to the user via a specially designed acoustic signal. This acoustic feedback allows users to quickly adjust and reorient the camera or the document, resulting in reduced access time and in more satisfactory user experience. Multiple user studies with blind participants are planned with the purpose of selecting an appropriate acoustic interface and of evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed assisted mobile OCR modality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application is concerned with the development of new technology designed to facilitate use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems to access printed text without sight. Specifically, this exploratory research will develop and test a novel system that, by means of a specially designed acoustic interface, will help a blind person take a well-framed, well-resolved image of a document for OCR processing using a smartphone or wearable camera. If successful, this novel approach to assisted mobile OCR will reduce access time and improve user experience of blind mobile OCR users.",Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR,8989105,R21EY025077,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Augmented Reality', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chest', 'Chickens', 'Clothing', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Marketing', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Report (document)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Restaurants', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Development Study', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'blind', 'design', 'egg', 'experience', 'handicapping condition', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'optical character recognition', 'research study', 'technology development', 'usability', 'way finding']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2016,230563,0.049640029470163535
"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.  We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, o perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment.  Our goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals, including those with physical disabilities and to enhance safety for older people and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions.  We plan to develop a computer-based design tool enabling architectural design professionals to assess the visual accessibility of a wide range of environments (such as a hotel lobby, subway station, or eye-clinic reception area).  This tool will simulate such environments with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or hazards, such as steps or benches, for different levels and types of low vision, and for spaces varying in lighting, surface properties and geometric arrangement.  Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives:  ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments."" Our research plan has three specific goals:  1) Empirical:  determine factors that influence low-vision accessibility related to hazard detection and navigation in real-world spaces.  2) Computational:  develop working models to predict low vision visibility and navigability in real-world spaces.  3) Deployment:  translate findings from basic vision science and clinical low vision into much needed industrial usage by producing a set of open source software modules to enhance architectural and lighting design for visual accessibility.  The key scientific personnel in our partnership come from three institutions:  University of Minnesota -- Gordon Legge and Daniel Kersten; University of Utah -- William Thompson and Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University -- Robert Shakespeare.  This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the necessary areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility -- empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), computer graphics and photometrically accurate rendering (Thompson & Shakespeare) and architectural lighting design (Shakespeare).  We have collaborative arrangements with additional architectural design professionals who will participate in the translation of our research and development into practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.

"NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of this proposal is to conduct research on the foundational models and algorithms in computer vision and machine learning for an egocentric vision based active learning co-robot wheelchair system to improve the quality of life of elders and disabled who have limited hand functionality or no hand functionality at all, and rely on wheelchairs for mobility. In this co-robt system, the wheelchair users wear a pair of egocentric camera glasses, i.e., the camera is capturing the users' field-of-the-views. This project help reduce the patients' reliance on care-givers. It fits NINR's mission in addressing key issues raised by the Nation's aging population and shortages of healthcare workforces, and in supporting patient-focused research that encourage and enable individuals to become guardians of their own well-beings.  The egocentric camera serves two purposes. On one hand, from vision based motion sensing, the system can capture unique head motion patterns of the users to control the robot wheelchair in a noninvasive way. Secondly, it serves as a unique environment aware vision sensor for the co-robot system as the user will naturally respond to the surroundings by turning their focus of attention, either consciously or subconsciously. Based on the inputs from the egocentric vision sensor and other on-board robotic sensors, an online learning reservoir computing network is exploited, which not only enables the robotic wheelchair system to actively solicit controls from the users when uncertainty is too high for autonomous operation, but also facilitates the robotic wheelchair system to learn from the solicited user controls. This way, the closed- loop co-robot wheelchair system will evolve and be more capable of handling more complicated environment overtime.  The aims ofthe project include: 1) develop an method to harness egocentric computer vision-based sensing of head movements as an alternative method for wheelchair control; 2) develop a method leveraging visual motion from the egocentric camera for category independent moving obstacle detection; and 3) close the loop of the active learning co-robot wheelchair system through uncertainty based active online learning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The project will improve the quality of life of those elders and disabled who rely on wheelchairs for mobility, and reduce their reliance on care-givers. It builds an intelligent wheelchair robot system that can adapt itself to the personalized behavior of the user. The project addresses the need of approximately 1 % of our world's population, including millions of Americans, who rely on wheelchair for mobility.",NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair,8914675,R01NR015371,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Disabled Persons', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Glass', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Visual Motion', 'Wheelchairs', 'aging population', 'base', 'improved', 'operation', 'programs', 'sensor']",NINR,STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,136355,0.07839305930588546
"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,8813596,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2015,59383,0.025067402034120494
"NRI: Small: A Co-Robotic Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project's objective is to develop enabling technology for a co-robotic navigation aid, called a Co-Robotic Cane (CRC), for the visually impaired. The CRC is able to collaborate with its user via intuitive Human-Device Interaction (HDl) mechanisms for effective navigation in 3D environments. The CRCs navigational functions include device position estimation, wayfinding, obstacle detection/avoidance, and object recognition. The use of the CRC will improve the visually impaired's independent mobility and thus their quality of life. The proposal's educational plan is to involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project, and use the project's activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision methods that support accurate blind navigation in 3D environments and intuitive HDl interfaces for effective use of device. These methods include: (1) a new robotic pose estimation method that provides accurate device pose by integrating egomotion estimation and visual feature tracking; (2) a pattern recognition method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model that may recognize indoor structures and objects for wayfinding and obstacle manipulation/ avoidance; (3) an innovative mechanism for intuitive conveying of the desired travel direction; and (4) a human intent detection interface for automatic device mode switching. The GPU implementation of the computer vision methods will make real-time execution possible. The proposed blind navigation solution will endow the CRC with advanced navigational functions that are currently unavailable in the existing blind navigation aids. The PI's team has performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the methods' near term applications will impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the methods will improve the autonomy of small robots and portable robotic devices that have a myriad of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the Pi's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.

"NRI: A Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid for the Visually Impaired PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The objective of the proposed research is to develop new technology for a Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid (W-ROMA) for the visually impaired. The W-ROMA is a hand-worn assistive device that provides assistance to a visually impaired individual in effectively grasping an object. Thanks to the onboard computer vision methods, the W-ROMA is capable of detecting a target object, determining the hand-object misalignment, and conveying to the wearer, via natural human-device interfaces, the desired hand motion for hand-object alignment. The W-ROMA will contribute to the independent lives of the visually impaired in twofold: First, it helps the visually impaired with independent travel by enabling them to identify a movable obstacle and manipulate the obstacle to make a passage. Second, it assists the visually impaired in effectively grasping an object for non-navigational purpose. The PIs will involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project and use the proposed project activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision and human-robot interaction methods that support accurate and effective object grasping for the visually impaired for their independent daily lives. These methods include: (1) a new real-time object recognition method; (2) an innovative hand-object alignment mechanism; (3) a novel hybrid tactile display system for object shape rendering; and (4) a computationally efficient device localization method. The proposed solutions can be encapsulated in a hand-worn robotic device. The W-ROMA will provide new co-robotic functions for the visually impaired. The PIs have performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision and tactile display methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the research will positively impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the proposed methods can be applied to other small robotic systems that have a wide range of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the PI's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.

"Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users Summary The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system that runs on smartphones and tablets to enable blind and visually impaired persons to read appliance displays.  This ability is increasingly necessary to use a variety of household and commercial appliances equipped with displays, such as microwave ovens and thermostats, and is essential for independent living, education and employment.  No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents.  Our proposed system runs as software on a standard, off-the-shelf smartphone or tablet and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze video images taken by the user and to detect and read the text within each image.  For blind users, this text is either read aloud using synthesized speech, or for low vision users, presented in magnified, contrast- enhanced form (which is most suited to the use of a tablet).  We propose to build on our past work on a prototype display reader using powerful new techniques that will enable the resulting system to read a greater variety of LED/LCD display text fonts, and to better accommodate the conditions that often make reading displays difficult, including glare, reflections and poor contrast.  These techniques include novel character recognition techniques adapted specifically to the domain of digital displays; finger detection to allow the user to point to a specific location of interest in the display; the use of display templates as reference images to match to, and thereby help interpret, noisy images of displays; and the integration of multiple views of the display into a single clear view.  Special user interface features such as the use of finger detection to help blind users aim the camera towards the display and contrast-enhancement for low vision users address the particular needs of different users.  Blind and visually impaired subjects will test the system periodically to provide feedback and performance data, driving the development and continual improvement of the system, which will be assessed with objective performance measures.  The resulting display reader system will be released as an app for smartphones and tablets that can be downloaded and used by anybody for free, and also as an open source project that can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self-sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays.  The proposed research would result in a smartphone/tablet-based assistive technology system (available for free) to provide increased access to such display information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users,8916115,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blindness', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Glare', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Location', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'information display', 'interest', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'prototype']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2015,368560,0.0980031435188434

"Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-invasive medical devices are fast emerging as powerful tools in providing quantitative, simple to parse data in assessing the health and wellness of users. These devices can provide information feedback to users on their state of health, and can potentially provide valuable real-time insight to doctors on the links between user consumption and activity on their respective health. Recently described epidermal electronics / multifunctional tattoos introduced from our lab and others have demonstrated sensing of biopressure, bioelectricity, analyte concentration, bacteria, and more. These structures potentially represent the evolution of wearable devices as they possess a negligible form factor and conform to any surface (such as skin or teeth), minimizing user impact. These devices also bypass more traditional, ""wearable"" gadgets that often require bulky mechanical fixtures or straps, require complex microfluidic systems or integrated electronics, cannot provide dynamic readout, and cannot be disposed of easily. Dielectric sensors are a class of structures that are able to probe the composition of a biofluid via their impedance spectrum, and can be configured for remote sensing via radio waves. These devices can be composed of isolated, thin film circuits, and are directly amenable to epidermal or tattoo formats. This measurement methodology is inherently tremendously powerful, as it can potentially measure multiple analytes at once by probing multiple resonance peaks, and can potentially be piggybacked onto existing RFID infrastructure for data readout. However, these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated, and under real-world applications dielectric sensors have often proven difficult to use. This is often due to simplistic readout (devices will directly correlate a single metric such s the real value of the impedance at a frequency to a biomarker) and are thus can be sensitive from user to user or to environmental conditions. Herein, the applicant will leverage the expertise and knowledge of the labs of Dr. Omenetto and colleagues to bring practical usability to these dielectric antennas, bridging the gap between laboratory measurement and real-time, and real-world health monitoring applications. The end-goal is to generate disposable, skin and teeth-mounted, dielectric sensors to remotely probe the presence of biomarkers in sweat, saliva, and potentially blood to draw definitive links between user nutrition and their health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to create non-invasive, wireless sensor tattoos to be tagged onto the human body for probing the composition of saliva, sweat, or blood. These wireless sensors would present negligible impediment to the user, and would require next to no upkeep to maintain, potentially facilitating an unprecedented level of subject data collection and dissemination. Such data could yield conclusive links between diet, activity, biomarkers, and public health.            ","Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition",8980210,F32EB021159,"['Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Electronics', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human body', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Nafion', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radio', 'Radio Waves', 'Reader', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Saliva', 'Silk', 'Skin', 'Sodium', 'Solutions', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Sweat', 'Sweating', 'System', 'Tattooing', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Urea', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'World Health', 'bioelectricity', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'enzyme activity', 'flexibility', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'insight', 'non-invasive monitor', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'real world application', 'remote sensing', 'response', 'saliva composition', 'sensor', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,F32,2015,56042,0.025003494077538973
"Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes new technology development and user studies aiming to facilitate the use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for blind people. Mobile OCR systems, implemented as smartphones apps, have recently appeared on the market. This technology unleashes the power of modern computer vision algorithms to enable a blind person to hear (via synthetic speech) the content of printed text imaged by the smartphone's camera. Unlike traditional OCR, that requires scanning of a document with a flatbed scanner, mobile OCR apps enable access to text anywhere, anytime. Using their own smartphones, blind people can read store receipts, menus, flyers, business cards, utility bills, and many other printed documents of the type normally encountered in everyday life. Unfortunately, current mobile OCR systems suffer from a chicken-and-egg problem, which limits their usability. They require the user to take a well-framed snapshot of the document to be scanned, with the full text in view, and at a close enough distance that each character can be well resolved and thus readable by the machine. However, taking a good picture of a document is difficult without sight, and thus without the ability to look at the scene being imaged by the camera through the smartphone's screen. Anecdotal evidence, supported by results of preliminary studies conducted by the principal investigator's group, confirms that acquisition of an OCR-readable image of a document can indeed by very challenging for some blind users. We plan to address this problem by developing and testing a new technique of assisted mobile OCR. As the user aims the camera at the document, the system analyzes in real time the stream of images acquired by the camera, and determines how the camera position and orientation should be adjusted so that an OCR-readable image of the document can be acquired. This information is conveyed to the user via a specially designed acoustic signal. This acoustic feedback allows users to quickly adjust and reorient the camera or the document, resulting in reduced access time and in more satisfactory user experience. Multiple user studies with blind participants are planned with the purpose of selecting an appropriate acoustic interface and of evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed assisted mobile OCR modality.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application is concerned with the development of new technology designed to facilitate use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems to access printed text without sight. Specifically, this exploratory research will develop and test a novel system that, by means of a specially designed acoustic interface, will help a blind person take a well-framed, well-resolved image of a document for OCR processing using a smartphone or wearable camera. If successful, this novel approach to assisted mobile OCR will reduce access time and improve user experience of blind mobile OCR users.                ",Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR,8812658,R21EY025077,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chest', 'Chickens', 'Clothing', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Marketing', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Report (document)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Restaurants', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Development Study', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'blind', 'design', 'egg', 'experience', 'handicapping condition', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'technology development', 'usability', 'way finding']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2015,191510,0.049640029470163535
"Context Understanding Technology to improve internet accessibility for users with DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this SBIR project is to develop a new tool to improve the ability of blind and visually impaired people to quickly get to the right web pages, to avoid ending up on the wrong web pages, and to reach the desired part of each web page efficiently. The motivation for this effort is that getting a 'big picture' understanding of a web page is one of the biggest challenges facing this population of computer users. Existing tools for blind and visually impaired people, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, present the entire web page serially, in full detail, either by textual output of the details, or b providing a magnified view of a small part of the page. However, if the user is not already familiar with the website, the resulting lack of context requires a laborious and time-consuming process to scan through sometimes hundreds of details before knowing whether anything of interest even exists on the page in question. In contrast, the proposed technology analyzes web pages in a similar way that sighted users quickly scan pages before reading in detail, to provide a succinct, informative guidance on the context and layout of the page, so that a user quickly gains a much richer ""big-picture"" understanding. The proposed Phase II project builds on a successful Phase I user evaluation of a proof- of-concept of the software, in which users expressed a strong preference for the contextual cues provided by the approach. Phase II includes creating a fully-functional prototype of the software tool. Throughout the technology development, feedback from users and practitioners will guide the path of the R&D for maximum usability. At the conclusion of Phase II, an end-user, in-home evaluation study will verify the effectiveness of the tool, providing the starting point for full-scale commercialization. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The R&D in this Phase II SBIR project will result in an improved way to use the Internet for individuals with visual disabilities. The technology will help to overcome the lack of accessibility and high level of frustration currently found among blind and visually impaired users. The results of the project will enable such individuals to explore new opportunities and be more productive, thus providing improved employment potential and an increase in the quality of life.",Context Understanding Technology to improve internet accessibility for users with,8795182,R44EY020082,"['Advertisements', 'Area', 'Arizona', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Boxing', 'Characteristics', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Generations', 'Government', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interest Group', 'Internet', 'Literature', 'Marketing', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'base', 'blind', 'commercialization', 'disability', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'natural language', 'phrases', 'preference', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'technology development', 'tool', 'usability', 'web page', 'web site']",NEI,"VORTANT TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2015,195445,0.06273378103358714
"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.  We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, o perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment.  Our goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals, including those with physical disabilities and to enhance safety for older people and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions.  We plan to develop a computer-based design tool enabling architectural design professionals to assess the visual accessibility of a wide range of environments (such as a hotel lobby, subway station, or eye-clinic reception area).  This tool will simulate such environments with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or hazards, such as steps or benches, for different levels and types of low vision, and for spaces varying in lighting, surface properties and geometric arrangement.  Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives:  ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments."" Our research plan has three specific goals:  1) Empirical:  determine factors that influence low-vision accessibility related to hazard detection and navigation in real-world spaces.  2) Computational:  develop working models to predict low vision visibility and navigability in real-world spaces.  3) Deployment:  translate findings from basic vision science and clinical low vision into much needed industrial usage by producing a set of open source software modules to enhance architectural and lighting design for visual accessibility.  The key scientific personnel in our partnership come from three institutions:  University of Minnesota -- Gordon Legge and Daniel Kersten; University of Utah -- William Thompson and Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University -- Robert Shakespeare.  This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the necessary areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility -- empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), computer graphics and photometrically accurate rendering (Thompson & Shakespeare) and architectural lighting design (Shakespeare).  We have collaborative arrangements with additional architectural design professionals who will participate in the translation of our research and development into practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.

"NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of this proposal is to conduct research on the foundational models and algorithms in computer vision and machine learning for an egocentric vision based active learning co-robot wheelchair system to improve the quality of life of elders and disabled who have limited hand functionality or no hand functionality at all, and rely on wheelchairs for mobility. In this co-robt system, the wheelchair users wear a pair of egocentric camera glasses, i.e., the camera is capturing the users' field-of-the-views. This project help reduce the patients' reliance on care-givers. It fits NINR's mission in addressing key issues raised by the Nation's aging population and shortages of healthcare workforces, and in supporting patient-focused research that encourage and enable individuals to become guardians of their own well-beings.  The egocentric camera serves two purposes. On one hand, from vision based motion sensing, the system can capture unique head motion patterns of the users to control the robot wheelchair in a noninvasive way. Secondly, it serves as a unique environment aware vision sensor for the co-robot system as the user will naturally respond to the surroundings by turning their focus of attention, either consciously or subconsciously. Based on the inputs from the egocentric vision sensor and other on-board robotic sensors, an online learning reservoir computing network is exploited, which not only enables the robotic wheelchair system to actively solicit controls from the users when uncertainty is too high for autonomous operation, but also facilitates the robotic wheelchair system to learn from the solicited user controls. This way, the closed- loop co-robot wheelchair system will evolve and be more capable of handling more complicated environment overtime.  The aims ofthe project include: 1) develop an method to harness egocentric computer vision-based sensing of head movements as an alternative method for wheelchair control; 2) develop a method leveraging visual motion from the egocentric camera for category independent moving obstacle detection; and 3) close the loop of the active learning co-robot wheelchair system through uncertainty based active online learning.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The project will improve the quality of life of those elders and disabled who rely on wheelchairs for mobility, and reduce their reliance on care-givers. It builds an intelligent wheelchair robot system that can adapt itself to the personalized behavior of the user. The project addresses the need of approximately 1 % of our world's population, including millions of Americans, who rely on wheelchair for mobility.             ",NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair,8838311,R01NR015371,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Build-it', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Disabled Persons', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Glass', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Visual Motion', 'Wheelchairs', 'aging population', 'base', 'improved', 'operation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor']",NINR,STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2014,155663,0.07839305930588546
"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. !         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.             ",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,8628140,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2014,59383,0.025067402034120494
"NRI: Small: A Co-Robotic Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project's objective is to develop enabling technology for a co-robotic navigation aid, called a Co-Robotic Cane (CRC), for the visually impaired. The CRC is able to collaborate with its user via intuitive Human-Device Interaction (HDl) mechanisms for effective navigation in 3D environments. The CRCs navigational functions include device position estimation, wayfinding, obstacle detection/avoidance, and object recognition. The use of the CRC will improve the visually impaired's independent mobility and thus their quality of life. The proposal's educational plan is to involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project, and use the project's activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision methods that support accurate blind navigation in 3D environments and intuitive HDl interfaces for effective use of device. These methods include: (1) a new robotic pose estimation method that provides accurate device pose by integrating egomotion estimation and visual feature tracking; (2) a pattern recognition method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model that may recognize indoor structures and objects for wayfinding and obstacle manipulation/ avoidance; (3) an innovative mechanism for intuitive conveying of the desired travel direction; and (4) a human intent detection interface for automatic device mode switching. The GPU implementation of the computer vision methods will make real-time execution possible. The proposed blind navigation solution will endow the CRC with advanced navigational functions that are currently unavailable in the existing blind navigation aids. The PI's team has performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the methods' near term applications will impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the methods will improve the autonomy of small robots and portable robotic devices that have a myriad of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the Pi's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.

"Sign Finding and Reading SFAR on GPU Accelerated Mobile Devices     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inability to access information on printed signs directly impacts the mobility independence of the over 1.2 million blind persons in the U.S. Many previously proposed technological solutions to this problem either required physical modifications to the environment (talking signs or the placement of coded markers) or required the user to carry around specialized computational equipment, which can be stigmatizing. A recently pursued strategy is to utilize the computational capabilities of smart phones and techniques from computer vision to allow blind persons to read signs at a distance using commercially available, non-stigmatizing, smart- phones. However, despite the fact that sophisticated algorithms exist to recognize and extract sign text from cluttered video input (as evidenced, for example, by mapping services such as Google Maps automatically locating and blurring out only license plate text in street-view maps) current mobile solutions for reading sign text at a distance perform relatively poorly. This poor performance is largely because until recently, smart-phone processors have simply not been able to execute state-of-the-art computer vision text extraction and recognition algorithms at real-time rates, which forced previous mobile sign readers to utilize older, simplistic, less effective algorithms. Next-generation smart-phones run on fundamentally different, hybrid processor architectures (such as the Tegra 4, Snapdragon 800, both released in 2013) with dedicated embedded graphical processing units (GPUs) and multi-core CPUs, which make them ideal for high-performance, vision-heavy computation. In this study, we propose to develop a smart-phone-based system for finding and reading signs at a distance which significantly outperforms previous such readers by implementing state-of-the-art text extraction algorithms on modern smart-phone hybrid GPU/CPU processor architectures. In Phase I, the proposed system will be developed and tested with blind users. In Phase II, feedback from user testing will be integrated into system design and the performance will be improved to permit operation in extremely challenging (such as low light) environments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 1.2 million people in the US are blind, and lack of safe and independent mobility substantially impacts the quality of life of this population. Printed textual signs, which are ubiquitously used in sighted navigation, are inaccessible to visually impaired persons, and this lack of access to environmental information contributes significantly to the mobility problem. This research would help develop a system whereby blind persons could use commercially available smart-phones to locate and read sign text at a distance.            ",Sign Finding and Reading SFAR on GPU Accelerated Mobile Devices,8779810,R43EY024800,"['Acceleration', 'Access to Information', 'Algorithms', 'Antirrhinum', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Eye', 'Feedback', 'Hybrids', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Modification', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Running', 'SKI gene', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'assistive device/technology', 'authority', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'next generation', 'operation', 'phase 1 study', 'public health relevance', 'volunteer']",NEI,"LYNNTECH, INC.",R43,2014,229742,0.06879432696921293
"Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users Summary The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system that runs on smartphones and tablets to enable blind and visually impaired persons to read appliance displays.  This ability is increasingly necessary to use a variety of household and commercial appliances equipped with displays, such as microwave ovens and thermostats, and is essential for independent living, education and employment.  No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents.  Our proposed system runs as software on a standard, off-the-shelf smartphone or tablet and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze video images taken by the user and to detect and read the text within each image.  For blind users, this text is either read aloud using synthesized speech, or for low vision users, presented in magnified, contrast- enhanced form (which is most suited to the use of a tablet).  We propose to build on our past work on a prototype display reader using powerful new techniques that will enable the resulting system to read a greater variety of LED/LCD display text fonts, and to better accommodate the conditions that often make reading displays difficult, including glare, reflections and poor contrast.  These techniques include novel character recognition techniques adapted specifically to the domain of digital displays; finger detection to allow the user to point to a specific location of interest in the display; the use of display templates as reference images to match to, and thereby help interpret, noisy images of displays; and the integration of multiple views of the display into a single clear view.  Special user interface features such as the use of finger detection to help blind users aim the camera towards the display and contrast-enhancement for low vision users address the particular needs of different users.  Blind and visually impaired subjects will test the system periodically to provide feedback and performance data, driving the development and continual improvement of the system, which will be assessed with objective performance measures.  The resulting display reader system will be released as an app for smartphones and tablets that can be downloaded and used by anybody for free, and also as an open source project that can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self-sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays.

The motivation for this effort is that getting a 'big picture' understanding of a  web page is one of the biggest challenges facing this population of computer users. Existing tools for blind and visually impaired people, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, present the entire web page serially, in full detail, either by textual output of the details, or b providing a magnified view of a small part of the page. However, if the user is not already familiar with the website, the resulting lack of context requires a laborious and time-consuming process to scan through sometimes hundreds of details before knowing whether anything of interest even exists on the page in question. In contrast, the proposed technology analyzes web pages in a similar way that sighted users quickly scan pages before reading in detail, to provide a succinct, informative guidance on the context and layout of the page, so that a user quickly gains a much richer ""big-picture"" understanding. The proposed Phase II project builds on a successful Phase I user evaluation of a proof- of-concept of the software, in which users expressed a strong preference for the contextual cues provided by the approach. Phase II includes creating a fully-functional prototype of the software tool. Throughout the technology development, feedback from users and practitioners will guide the path of the R&D for maximum usability. At the conclusion of Phase II, an end-user, in-home evaluation study will verify the effectiveness of the tool, providing the starting point for full-scale commercialization. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The R&D in this Phase II SBIR project will result in an improved way to use the Internet for individuals with visual disabilities. The technology will help to overcome the lack of accessibility and high level of frustration currently found among blind and visually impaired users.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces  Title: Designing Visually Accessible Spaces NIH Program Announcement: 10-234 Bioengineering Research Partnerships (BRP)[R01] Abstract Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision. We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals, including those with physical disabilities, and to enhance safety for older people and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool enabling architectural design professionals to assess the visual accessibility of a wide range of environments (such as a hotel lobby, subway station, or eye-clinic reception area). This tool will simulate such environments with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or hazards, such as steps or benches, for different levels and types of low vision, and for spaces varying in lighting, surface properties and geometric arrangement. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments."" Our research plan has three specific goals: 1) Empirical: determine factors that influence low-vision accessibility related to hazard detection and navigation in real-world spaces. 2) Computational: develop working models to predict low vision visibility and navigability in real-world spaces. 3) Deployment: translate findings from basic vision science and clinical low vision into much needed industrial usage by producing a set of open source software modules to enhance architectural and lighting design for visual accessibility. The key scientific personnel in our partnership come from three institutions: University of Minnesota -- Gordon Legge and Daniel Kersten; University of Utah -- William Thompson and Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University -- Robert Shakespeare. This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the necessary areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility -- empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), computer graphics and photometrically accurate rendering (Thompson & Shakespeare) and architectural lighting design (Shakespeare). We have collaborative arrangements with additional architectural design professionals who will participate in the translation of our research and development into practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.  We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, o perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment.

"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. !         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.             ",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,8414506,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2013,59383,0.025067402034120494
"Smart Anatomic Recognition System to Guide Emergency Intubation and Resuscitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 3 million emergency intubations are performed in the US every year and failure rates can be as high as 50% (3-5). Success is highly dependent on how frequently the responder performs this life-saving procedure on humans (6). Brio Device, LLC, an airway management medical device company, is addressing the need to decouple the success of the procedure from the experience of the user with their ""smart"" intubation device which integrates anatomic structure recognition algorithms and visual guidance feedback with an articulating stylet. Brio's intubation device is specifically designed fo the needs of emergency responders, such as paramedics, emergency department personnel, code teams in hospitals and military medics, who often arrive at the patient first. The smart intubation device will reduce failure rates by providing the user with visual instruction of the correct path to the trachea as he places the endotracheal tube. The guidance software uses machine learning and computer vision algorithms to recognize the anatomy and determine the path to insert the tube. Ultimately, the intubation device will include both a guidance display on an LCD screen and an optical stylet that has single-axis angulation control of the distal tip. For the purpose of this Phase I study, a laptop or desktop computer will be used for the image processing and the guidance display that accompanies the articulating stylet. The long-term goal is to create a device that is compact, light-weight and portable to suit the needs of ambulances and hospital crash carts.  The hypothesis for this study is that by incorporating a video guidance display with an articulating stylet, inexperienced users will be more successful in correctly placing the endotracheal tube using this device compared to direct laryngoscopy. To achieve this goal, image processing and machine learning algorithms will be developed to recognize key anatomic structures in the airway. Software will also be developed determine the path the tube should follow and to display this information for the user. Finally, the efficacy of the device will be validated in airway simulation mannequins with medical students serving as the inexperienced users. Phase II will focus on integrating the guidance software, articulating optical stylet and display into a portable device with embedded hardware and software contained within the stylet handle. At completion of Phase II, the device will be ready for clinica trials and FDA testing.  Brio will enter the $20 billion airway market with its intubation device. Initial sales will begin with anesthesiologists who are early adopters of new technology to assist with difficult airways. Brio will market its product to ~327,000 clinicians who use intubation devices. The U.S. addressable market for emergency intubation is ~$900M for the 41,000 ambulances and 5,800 emergency departments and hospital code teams.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this SBIR Phase I, Brio Device, LLC plans to create and evaluate a device that improves the success rate of emergency intubations by coupling a smart guidance display with a user-controlled single-axis articulating stylet. Emergency intubations are often performed in challenging situations by personnel who do the procedure infrequently. Since failure rates are as high as 50% and approximately 180,000 deaths occur each year from failed pre-hospital intubations, a device is needed to provide visual guidance information to assist the users and increase their success rates in emergency situations.            ",Smart Anatomic Recognition System to Guide Emergency Intubation and Resuscitation,8453607,R43HL114160,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulances', 'Anatomic structures', 'Anatomy', 'Brain Death', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Critical Care', 'Destinations', 'Devices', 'Distal', 'Emergency Situation', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Instruction', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Laryngoscopy', 'Left', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Marketing', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Students', 'Military Hospitals', 'Military Personnel', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Oxygen', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Resuscitation', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachea', 'Tube', 'Visual', 'commercial application', 'design', 'endotracheal', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'information display', 'laptop', 'light weight', 'new technology', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'public health relevance', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'success']",NHLBI,"BRIO DEVICE, LLC",R43,2013,244710,0.05013554573996029
"Video-based Speech Enhancement for Persons with Vision and Hearing Loss     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Video-based Speech Enhancement for Persons with Hearing and Vision Loss Project Summary It is estimated that by 2030, the number of people in the United States over the age of 65 will account for over 20% of the total population.  Hearing and vision loss naturally accompanies the aging process.  Persons with hearing loss can benefit from observing the visual cues from a speaker such as the shape of the lips and facial expression to greatly improve their ability to comprehend speech.  However, persons with vision loss cannot make use of these visual cues, and have a harder time understanding speech, especially in noisy environments.  Furthermore, people with normal vision can use visual information to identify a speaker in a group, which allows them to focus on this person.  This can greatly benefit a person with hearing loss who may be using a device such as a sound amplifier or a hearing aid.  A user with vision loss, however, needs to be provided with this speaker information to make optimal use of such devices.  We propose developing a prototype device that will clean the speech signal from a target speaker and improve speech comprehension for persons with hearing and vision loss in everyday situations.  In order to accomplish this task, we need to harness the visual cues that have so far largely been ignored in the design of assistive technolo- gies for persons with hearing loss.  Our first aim is to learn speaker-independent visual cues that are associated with the target speech signal, and use these audio-visual cues to design speech enhancement algorithms that perform much better in noisy everyday environment than current methods which only utilize the audio signal.  We will utilize a video camera and computer vision methods to design advanced digital signal processing techniques to enhance the target speech signals recorded through a microphone.  Our second aim is to use the video and audio signals to detect and efficiently localize the visible speaker.  The information regarding the location of the speaker of interest can then be used to efficiently perform speaker separation, as well as be provided to the user.  Finally, we aim to implement these developed algorithms on a portable prototype system.  We will test the performance of this system and improve the user-interface through user experiments in real-world situations as well as laboratory conditions.  The end product will show the feasibility and importance of incorporating multiple modalities into sensory assistive devices, and set the stage for future research and development efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It is estimated that by 2030, more than one in five people in the United States will be over the age of 65.  Age- related hearing and vision loss is considered a natural consequence of the aging process, yet current assistive technology approaches do little to address this type of sensory loss.  The proposed research will test the feasibility of incorporating visual information in hearing aids, which is expected to improve speech perception for persons with hearing and vision loss in everyday situations, greatly enhancing their ability to lead independent lives, remain employable, and maintain active participation in society.                ",Video-based Speech Enhancement for Persons with Vision and Hearing Loss,8443624,R21EY022200,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Amplifiers', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Blindness', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lip structure', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presbycusis', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Aids', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Perception', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Voice', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'social', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'tool development', 'visual information']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2013,198801,-0.06307624590596309
"Mobile Search for the Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The technology developed as part of this NIH SBIR project will transform the cell phone camera of visually impaired individuals into a powerful tool capable of identifying the objects they encounter, track the items they own, or navigate complex new environments. Broad access to low-cost visual intelligence technologies developed in this project will improve the independence and capabilities of the visually impaired. There has been tremendous technological progress in computer vision and in the computational power and network bandwidth of and Smartphone platforms. The synergy of these advances stands to revolutionize the way people find information and interact with the physical world. However, these technologies are not yet fully in the hands of the visually impaired, arguably the population that could benefit the most from these developments. Part of the barrier to progress in this area has been that computer vision can accurately handle only a small fraction of the typical images coming from a cell phone camera. To cope with these limitations and make any-image recognition possible, IQ Engines will develop a hybrid system that uses both computer vision and crowdsourcing: if the computer algorithms are not able to understand an image, then the image is sent to a unique crowdsourcing network of people for image analysis. The proposed research includes specific aims to both develop advanced computer vision algorithms for object recognition and advanced crowdsourced networks optimized to the needs of the visually impaired community. This approach combines the speed and accuracy of computer vision with the robustness and understanding of human vision, ultimately providing the user fast and accurate information about the content of any image.           The image recognition technology developed in this application will enable the visually impaired to access visual information using a mobile phone camera, a device most people already have. Transforming the camera into an intelligent visual sensor will lower the cost of assistance and improve the quality of life of the visually impaired community through increased independence and capabilities.

"NRI: Small: A Co-Robotic Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project's objective is to develop enabling technology for a co-robotic navigation aid, called a Co-Robotic Cane (CRC), for the visually impaired. The CRC is able to collaborate with its user via intuitive Human-Device Interaction (HDl) mechanisms for effective navigation in 3D environments. The CRCs navigational functions include device position estimation, wayfinding, obstacle detection/avoidance, and object recognition. The use of the CRC will improve the visually impaired's independent mobility and thus their quality of life. The proposal's educational plan is to involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project, and use the project's activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision methods that support accurate blind navigation in 3D environments and intuitive HDl interfaces for effective use of device. These methods include: (1) a new robotic pose estimation method that provides accurate device pose by integrating egomotion estimation and visual feature tracking; (2) a pattern recognition method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model that may recognize indoor structures and objects for wayfinding and obstacle manipulation/ avoidance; (3) an innovative mechanism for intuitive conveying of the desired travel direction; and (4) a human intent detection interface for automatic device mode switching. The GPU implementation of the computer vision methods will make real-time execution possible. The proposed blind navigation solution will endow the CRC with advanced navigational functions that are currently unavailable in the existing blind navigation aids. The PI's team has performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the methods' near term applications will impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the methods will improve the autonomy of small robots and portable robotic devices that have a myriad of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the Pi's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The co-robotic navigation aid and the related technology address a growing public health care issue -- visual impairment and target improving the life quality of the blind.

"Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users  Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users Summary The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system that runs on smartphones and tablets to enable blind and visually impaired persons to read appliance displays. This ability is increasingly necessary to use a variety of household and commercial appliances equipped with displays, such as microwave ovens and thermostats, and is essential for independent living, education and employment. No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents. Our proposed system runs as software on a standard, off-the-shelf smartphone or tablet and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze video images taken by the user and to detect and read the text within each image. For blind users, this text is either read aloud using synthesized speech, or for low vision users, presented in magnified, contrast- enhanced form (which is most suited to the use of a tablet).  We propose to build on our past work on a prototype display reader using powerful new techniques that will enable the resulting system to read a greater variety of LED/LCD display text fonts, and to better accommodate the conditions that often make reading displays difficult, including glare, reflections and poor contrast. These techniques include novel character recognition techniques adapted specifically to the domain of digital displays; finger detection to allow the user to point to a specific location of interest in the display; the use of display templates as reference images to match to, and thereby help interpret, noisy images of displays; and the integration of multiple views of the display into a single clear view. Special user interface features such as the use of finger detection to help blind users aim the camera towards the display and contrast-enhancement for low vision users address the particular needs of different users. Blind and visually impaired subjects will test the system periodically to provide feedback and performance data, driving the development and continual improvement of the system, which will be assessed with objective performance measures. The resulting display reader system will be released as an app for smartphones and tablets that can be downloaded and used by anybody for free, and also as an open source project that can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self-sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays.  The proposed research would result in a smartphone/tablet-based assistive technology system (available for free) to provide increased access to such display information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.                ",Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users,8579051,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Glare', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Location', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'information display', 'interest', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'prototype', 'public health relevance']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2013,376082,0.09748635841116116
"A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians Abstract Project Summary Urban intersections are among the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel. They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult. To alleviate this problem, we propose to develop and evaluate a cell phone-based system to analyze images of street intersections, taken by a blind or visually impaired person using a standard cell phone, to provide real-time feedback. Building on our past work on a prototype ""Crosswatch"" system that uses computer vision algorithms to find crosswalks and Walk lights, we will greatly enhance the functionality of the system with information about the intersection layout and the identity of its connecting streets, the presence of stop signs, one-way signs and other controls indicating right-of-way, and timing information integrated from Walk/Don't Walk lights, countdown timers and other traffic lights. The system will convey intersection information, and will actively guide the user to align himself/herself with crosswalks, using a combination of synthesized speech and audio tones. We will conduct human factors studies to optimize the system functionality and the configuration of the user interface, as well as develop interactive training applications to equip users with the skills to better use the system. These training applications, implemented as additional cell phone software to complement the intersection system, will train users to hold the camera horizontal and forward and to minimize veer when traversing a crosswalk. The intersection analysis and training software will be made freely available for download onto popular cell phones (such as iPhone, Android or Symbian models). The cell phone will not need any hardware modifications or add-ons to run this software. Ultimately a user will be able to download an entire suite of such algorithms for free onto the cell phone he or she is already likely to be carrying, without having to carry a separate piece of equipment for each function.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to walk safely and confidently along sidewalks and traverse crosswalks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task. The proposed research would result in a highly accessible system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to augment existing wayfinding techniques, which could dramatically improve independent travel for blind and visually impaired persons.

"Context Understanding Technology to improve internet accessibility for users with     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this SBIR project is to develop a new tool to improve the ability of blind and visually impaired people to quickly get to the right web pages, to avoid ending up on the wrong web pages, and to reach the desired part of each web page efficiently. The motivation for this effort is that getting a 'big picture' understanding of a web page is one of the biggest challenges facing this population of computer users. Existing tools for blind and visually impaired people, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, present the entire web page serially, in full detail, either by textual output of the details, or b providing a magnified view of a small part of the page. However, if the user is not already familiar with the website, the resulting lack of context requires a laborious and time-consuming process to scan through sometimes hundreds of details before knowing whether anything of interest even exists on the page in question. In contrast, the proposed technology analyzes web pages in a similar way that sighted users quickly scan pages before reading in detail, to provide a succinct, informative guidance on the context and layout of the page, so that a user quickly gains a much richer ""big-picture"" understanding. The proposed Phase II project builds on a successful Phase I user evaluation of a proof- of-concept of the software, in which users expressed a strong preference for the contextual cues provided by the approach. Phase II includes creating a fully-functional prototype of the software tool. Throughout the technology development, feedback from users and practitioners will guide the path of the R&D for maximum usability. At the conclusion of Phase II, an end-user, in-home evaluation study will verify the effectiveness of the tool, providing the starting point for full-scale commercialization.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The R&D in this Phase II SBIR project will result in an improved way to use the Internet for individuals with visual disabilities. The technology will help to overcome the lack of accessibility and high level of frustration currently found among blind and visually impaired users.

"Mobile Search for the Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The technology developed as part of this NIH SBIR project will transform the cell phone camera of visually impaired individuals into a powerful tool capable of identifying the objects they encounter, track the items they own, or navigate complex new environments. Broad access to low-cost visual intelligence technologies developed in this project will improve the independence and capabilities of the visually impaired. There has been tremendous technological progress in computer vision and in the computational power and network bandwidth of and Smartphone platforms. The synergy of these advances stands to revolutionize the way people find information and interact with the physical world. However, these technologies are not yet fully in the hands of the visually impaired, arguably the population that could benefit the most from these developments. Part of the barrier to progress in this area has been that computer vision can accurately handle only a small fraction of the typical images coming from a cell phone camera. To cope with these limitations and make any-image recognition possible, IQ Engines will develop a hybrid system that uses both computer vision and crowdsourcing: if the computer algorithms are not able to understand an image, then the image is sent to a unique crowdsourcing network of people for image analysis. The proposed research includes specific aims to both develop advanced computer vision algorithms for object recognition and advanced crowdsourced networks optimized to the needs of the visually impaired community. This approach combines the speed and accuracy of computer vision with the robustness and understanding of human vision, ultimately providing the user fast and accurate information about the content of any image.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    The image recognition technology developed in this application will enable the visually impaired to access visual information using a mobile phone camera, a device most people already have.

"Vision Without Sight: Exploring the Environment with a Portable Camera  Vision without Sight: Exploring the Environment with a Portable Camera Project Summary As computer vision object recognition algorithms improve in accuracy and speed, and computers become more powerful and compact, it is becoming increasingly practical to implement such algorithms on portable devices such as camera-enabled cell phones. This ""mobile vision"" approach allows normally sighted users to identify objects, signs, places and other features in the environment simply by snapping a photo and waiting a few seconds for the results of the object recognition analysis. The approach holds great promise for blind or visually impaired (VI) users, who may have no other means of identifying important features that are undetectable by non-visual cues. However, in order for the approach to be practical for VI users, the interaction between the user and the environment using the camera must be properly facilitated. For instance, since the user may not know in advance which direction to point the camera towards a desired target, he or she must be able to pan the camera left and right to search for it, and receive rapid feedback whenever it is detected. Drawing on past experience of the PI and his colaborators on object recognition systems for VI users, we propose to study the use of mobile vision technologies for exploring features in the environment, specificaly examining the process of discovering these features and obtaining guidance towards them. Our main objectives are to investigate the strategies adopted by users of these technologies to expedite the exploration process, devise and test maximally effective user interfaces consistent with these strategies, and to assess and benchmark the efficiency of the technologies. The result will be a set of minimum design standards that will specify the system performance parameters, the user interface functionality and the operational strategies necessary for any mobile vision object recognition system for VI users.

"Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Handsight is a mobile phone service that offers an affordable, extensible set of automated sight-assistant functions to millions of blind and low-vision persons at $30/month atop standard voice and data fees. To the user, Handsight is simply a mobile phone application, requiring no special equipment or updating. By aiming a mobile telephone<s camera in roughly the right direction and pressing just one button, a Handsight user can snap a picture, send it to the Handsight computer center along with location data, and have a response within seconds. Moving the key computation and data from the handset to web servers cut cost, eases technology upgrades, and enables numerous data and technology partnerships needed to rapidly solve a broad spectrum of tasks. To allow widespread adoption Handsight uses voice, keypad, and vibration for user interaction; and for extensibility it is built on open-source software both on the handset and on the web application infrastructure. The range of tasks encountered by the blind and low-vision requires an array of components to solve: some are more heavily text-oriented and involve no location/navigational feedback (distinguishing and identifying different medicines; finding the phone bill in a stack of letters); some are more specifically navigational (locating the exact store entrance, finding the bus stop); yet others are informational (finding out when the next bus is due). Since we aim to provide a broadly useful tool, Handsight has to accommodate the whole range of task types. We are therefore proposing to build an architecture that integrates a set of components addressing the various task types, from text-detection and recognition software to navigational databases. Handsight<s application programming interface (API) will enable third parties to add capabilities to solve new tasks. As a web service, Handsight can evolve as computer vision and navigation technologies advance without requiring users to upgrade handsets or buy new versions of software. Phase I of this project was funded by the Dept. of Education / NIDRR and completed successfully between 10/01/2007 and 04/01/2008 under grant # H133S070044. It demonstrated not just the viability of the proposed project but also likely demand for such a service. (The NIDRR<s immutable deadlines precluded us from pursuing a Phase II with that agency.) Phase II consists in building the cell phone application and remote processing infrastructure with APIs to enable plug-in of the basic and future features. Subcontractor Smith-Kettlewell Institute for Eye Research will assure usability by blind and low-vision users; data partner NAVTEQ will provide a range of leading-edge digital map data. Blindsight already owns fast, accurate text detection and recognition software, and has experience in building scalable web services. A minimum set of features that make for a system with widespread appeal will be developed and/or licensed, and integrated into the service.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Handsight service falls squarely in the NEI mission to support research and programs with respect to visual disorders and the special health problems and requirements of the blind. It aims to provide a maximum of mobility and independence to the blind and low-vision using today<s mobile phone infrastructure via automated web services, using a minimum of specialized hardware and training. The 3 million-plus blind and low-vision persons in the U.S. encounter barriers to such activities of daily living as travel, navigation, and shopping, reading and social interactions. The difficulty of recognizing when a friend is nearby, of finding a product in a grocery store, of making change or locating a destination building often require sighted friends or assistants to make these tasks possible. This is expensive, difficult to arrange, and increases dependence. The Handsight system will simplify or make possible to many a new set of tasks previously requiring human assistance or special-purpose devices.

"Mid-Level Vision Systems for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low vision is a significant reduction of visual function that cannot be fully corrected by ordinary lenses, medical treatment, or surgery. Aging, injuries, and diseases can cause low vision. Its leading causes and those of blindness, include cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), both of which are more prevalent in the elderly population. Our overarching goal is to develop devices to aid people with low vision. We propose to use techniques of computer vision and computational neuroscience to build systems that enhance natural images. We plan test these systems on normal people and visually impaired older adults, with and without AMD. We have three milestones to reach: 1) Our first milestone will be to develop a system for low-noise image-contrast enhancement, which should help with AMD, because it causes lower contrast sensitivity. 2) Our second milestone will be a system that extracts the main contours of images in a cortical-like manner. Superimposing these contours on images should help with contrast-sensitivity problems at occlusion boundaries. Diffusing regions inside contours should help with crowding problems prominent in AMD. 3) Our third milestone is to probe whether these systems can help people with low vision people. For this purpose, we plan to use a battery of search and recognition psychophysical tests tailor-made for AMD. We put together an interdisciplinary team. The Principal Investigator is Dr. Norberto Grzywacz from Biomedical Engineering at USC. Drs. Gerard Medioni from Computer Science and Bartlett Mel from Biomedical Engineering at USC will lead the efforts in Specific Aims 1 and 2 respectively. Drs.

"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and  about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is  currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of  CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-  ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are,  they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms  2) Accommodative Mechanisms  3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms  There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term,  we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions  associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause. In phase t, we propose to:  ¿Clinically define CVS by observing the incidence of ocular surface abnormalities in symptomatic subjects  and compare them with an age and sex matched non-symptomatic control population  ¿Develop specialized micro-environment glasses to combat CVS symptoms  ¿Study the efficacy of micro-environment glasses in symptomatic and control populations  ¿Critically evaluate viability of CVS micro-environment glasses as a commercial product using both statistical   methods and subjective questionnaires n/a",Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS,8203808,R41EY015023,"['Address', 'Age', 'Asthenopia', 'Back', 'Blurred vision', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Burns', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Headache', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Neck', 'Pain', 'Phase', 'Population Control', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'Shoulder', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'combat', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'eye dryness', 'improved', 'ocular surface', 'sex']",NEI,"SEEFIT, INC.",R41,2011,47724,0.0168299436166671

"A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians Abstract Project Summary Urban intersections are among the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel. They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult. To alleviate this problem, we propose to develop and evaluate a cell phone-based system to analyze images of street intersections, taken by a blind or visually impaired person using a standard cell phone, to provide real-time feedback. Building on our past work on a prototype ""Crosswatch"" system that uses computer vision algorithms to find crosswalks and Walk lights, we will greatly enhance the functionality of the system with information about the intersection layout and the identity of its connecting streets, the presence of stop signs, one-way signs and other controls indicating right-of-way, and timing information integrated from Walk/Don't Walk lights, countdown timers and other traffic lights. The system will convey intersection information, and will actively guide the user to align himself/herself with crosswalks, using a combination of synthesized speech and audio tones. We will conduct human factors studies to optimize the system functionality and the configuration of the user interface, as well as develop interactive training applications to equip users with the skills to better use the system. These training applications, implemented as additional cell phone software to complement the intersection system, will train users to hold the camera horizontal and forward and to minimize veer when traversing a crosswalk. The intersection analysis and training software will be made freely available for download onto popular cell phones (such as iPhone, Android or Symbian models). The cell phone will not need any hardware modifications or add-ons to run this software. Ultimately a user will be able to download an entire suite of such algorithms for free onto the cell phone he or she is already likely to be carrying, without having to carry a separate piece of equipment for each function.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to walk safely and confidently along sidewalks and traverse crosswalks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task. The proposed research would result in a highly accessible system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to augment existing wayfinding techniques, which could dramatically improve independent travel for blind and visually impaired persons.              The ability to walk safely and confidently along sidewalks and traverse crosswalks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task.

"Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Handsight is a mobile phone service that offers an affordable, extensible set of automated sight-assistant functions to millions of blind and low-vision persons at $30/month atop standard voice and data fees. To the user, Handsight is simply a mobile phone application, requiring no special equipment or updating. By aiming a mobile telephone<s camera in roughly the right direction and pressing just one button, a Handsight user can snap a picture, send it to the Handsight computer center along with location data, and have a response within seconds. Moving the key computation and data from the handset to web servers cut cost, eases technology upgrades, and enables numerous data and technology partnerships needed to rapidly solve a broad spectrum of tasks. To allow widespread adoption Handsight uses voice, keypad, and vibration for user interaction; and for extensibility it is built on open-source software both on the handset and on the web application infrastructure. The range of tasks encountered by the blind and low-vision requires an array of components to solve: some are more heavily text-oriented and involve no location/navigational feedback (distinguishing and identifying different medicines; finding the phone bill in a stack of letters); some are more specifically navigational (locating the exact store entrance, finding the bus stop); yet others are informational (finding out when the next bus is due). Since we aim to provide a broadly useful tool, Handsight has to accommodate the whole range of task types. We are therefore proposing to build an architecture that integrates a set of components addressing the various task types, from text-detection and recognition software to navigational databases. Handsight<s application programming interface (API) will enable third parties to add capabilities to solve new tasks. As a web service, Handsight can evolve as computer vision and navigation technologies advance without requiring users to upgrade handsets or buy new versions of software. Phase I of this project was funded by the Dept. of Education / NIDRR and completed successfully between 10/01/2007 and 04/01/2008 under grant # H133S070044. It demonstrated not just the viability of the proposed project but also likely demand for such a service. (The NIDRR<s immutable deadlines precluded us from pursuing a Phase II with that agency.) Phase II consists in building the cell phone application and remote processing infrastructure with APIs to enable plug-in of the basic and future features. Subcontractor Smith-Kettlewell Institute for Eye Research will assure usability by blind and low-vision users; data partner NAVTEQ will provide a range of leading-edge digital map data. Blindsight already owns fast, accurate text detection and recognition software, and has experience in building scalable web services. A minimum set of features that make for a system with widespread appeal will be developed and/or licensed, and integrated into the service.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Handsight service falls squarely in the NEI mission to support research and programs with respect to visual disorders and the special health problems and requirements of the blind. It aims to provide a maximum of mobility and independence to the blind and low-vision using today<s mobile phone infrastructure via automated web services, using a minimum of specialized hardware and training. The 3 million-plus blind and low-vision persons in the U.S. encounter barriers to such activities of daily living as travel, navigation, and shopping, reading and social interactions. The difficulty of recognizing when a friend is nearby, of finding a product in a grocery store, of making change or locating a destination building often require sighted friends or assistants to make these tasks possible. This is expensive, difficult to arrange, and increases dependence. The Handsight system will simplify or make possible to many a new set of tasks previously requiring human assistance or special-purpose devices.        Re: Project Title: Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision  FOA: PHS 2009-02 Omnibus Solicitation of the NIH, CDC, FDA and ACF for Small Business  Innovation Research Grant Applications (Parent SBIR [R43/R44])  Proposed project period: April 1, 2010 - March 31, 2012  Principal Investigator: Hallinan, Peter W.

"Computational Methods for Analysis of Mouth Shapes in Sign Languages    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hand) and by the nonmanual components (the face). These facial articulations perform significant semantic, prosodic, pragmatic, and syntactic functions. This proposal will systematically study mouth positions in ASL. Our hypothesis is that ASL mouth positions are more extensive than those used in speech. To study this hypothesis, this project is divided into three aims. In our first aim, we hypothesize that mouth positions are fundamental for the understanding of signs produced in context because they are very distinct from signs seen in isolation. To study this we have recently collected a database of ASL sentences and nonmanuals in over 3600 video clips from 20 Deaf native signers. Our experiments will use this database to identify potential mappings from visual to linguistic features. To successfully do this, our second aim is to design a set of shape analysis and discriminant analysis algorithms that can efficiently analyze the large number of frames in these video clips. The goal is to define a linguistically useful model, i.e., the smallest model that contains the main visual features from which further predictions can be made. Then, in our third aim, we will explore the hypothesis that the linguistically distinct mouth positions are also visually distinct. In particular, we will use the algorithms defined in the second aim to determine if distinct visual features are used to define different linguistic categories. This result will show whether linguistically meaningful mouth positions are not only necessary in ASL (as hypothesized in aim 1), but whether they are defined using non-overlapping visual features (as hypothesized in aim 3). These aims address a critical need. At present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out manually, that is, the shape and position of each facial feature in each frame must be recorded by hand. Furthermore, to be able to draw conclusive results for the design of a linguistic model, it is necessary to study many video sequences of related sentences as produced by different signers. It has thus proven nearly impossible to continue this research manually. The algorithms designed in the course of this grant will facilitate this analysis of ASL nonmanuals and lead to better teaching materials.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the non-manuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.           Project Narrative Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision. We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our long-term goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals and to enhance safety for the elderly and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool in which environments (such as a hotel lobby, large classroom, or hospital reception area), could be simulated with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or obstacles, such as steps or benches, under differing lighting conditions. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments"". Our research plan has four specific goals: 1) Develop methods for predicting the physical levels of light reaching the eye in existing or planned architectural spaces. 2) Acquire performance data for normally sighted subjects with visual restrictions and people with low vision to investigate perceptual capabilities critical to visually-based mobility. 3) Develop models that can predict perceptual competence on tasks critical to visually-based mobility. 4) Demonstrate a proof-of-concept software tool that operates on design models from existing architectural design systems and is able to highlight potential obstacles to visual accessibility. The lead investigators in our partnership come from three institutions: University of Minnesota Gordon Legge, Daniel Kersten; University of Utah William Thompson, Peter Shirley, Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University Robert Shakespeare. This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the four areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), photometrically correct computer graphics (Shirley), and architectural design and lighting (Shakespeare).           n/a",Designing Visually Accessible Spaces,8037680,R01EY017835,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Blindness', 'Central Scotomas', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lobbying', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Photometry', 'Published Comment', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Safety', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Space Perception', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'design', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'luminance', 'model design', 'model development', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2011,513228,0.07868370022845347
"Mid-Level Vision Systems for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low vision is a significant reduction of visual function that cannot be fully corrected by ordinary lenses, medical treatment, or surgery. Aging, injuries, and diseases can cause low vision. Its leading causes and those of blindness, include cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), both of which are more prevalent in the elderly population. Our overarching goal is to develop devices to aid people with low vision. We propose to use techniques of computer vision and computational neuroscience to build systems that enhance natural images. We plan test these systems on normal people and visually impaired older adults, with and without AMD. We have three milestones to reach: 1) Our first milestone will be to develop a system for low-noise image-contrast enhancement, which should help with AMD, because it causes lower contrast sensitivity. 2) Our second milestone will be a system that extracts the main contours of images in a cortical-like manner. Superimposing these contours on images should help with contrast-sensitivity problems at occlusion boundaries. Diffusing regions inside contours should help with crowding problems prominent in AMD. 3) Our third milestone is to probe whether these systems can help people with low vision people. For this purpose, we plan to use a battery of search and recognition psychophysical tests tailor-made for AMD. We put together an interdisciplinary team. The Principal Investigator is Dr. Norberto Grzywacz from Biomedical Engineering at USC. Drs. Gerard Medioni from Computer Science and Bartlett Mel from Biomedical Engineering at USC will lead the efforts in Specific Aims 1 and 2 respectively. Drs. Bosco Tjan from USC Psychology, Susana Chung from the University of Houston, and Eli Peli from Harvard Medical School will lead Specific Aim 3. Other scientists are from USC.

"Camera-based Text Recognition from Complex Backgrounds for the Blind or Visually There are more than 10 million blind and visually impaired people living in America today. Recent technology developments in computer vision, digital cameras, and portable computers make it possible to assist these individuals by developing camera-based products that combine computer vision technology with other existing products.  Although a number of reading assistants have been designed specifically for people who are blind or visually impaired, reading text from complex backgrounds or non-flat surfaces is very challenging and has not yet been successfully addressed. Many everyday tasks involve these challenging conditions, such as reading instructions on vending machines, titles of books aligned on a shelf, instructions on medicine bottles or labels on soup cans.  This proposal focuses on the development of new computer vision algorithms to recognize text from complex backgrounds: 1) from backgrounds with multiple different colors (e.g .. the titles of books lined up on a shelf) and 2) from non-flat surfaces (e.g .. labels on medicine bottles or soup cans). The newly developed computer vision techniques will be integrated with off-the-shelf optical character recognition (OCR) and speech-synthesis software products. Visual information will be captured via a head-mounted camera (on sunglasses or hat) and analyzed by a portable computer (PDA or cell phone), while the speech display will be outputted via mini speakers, earphones, or Bluetooth device. A practical reading system prototype will be produced to read text from complex backgrounds and non-flat surfaces. The system will be cost-effective since it requires only a head mounted camera (<US$100 for 1M resolution), a wearable computer (<US$300), and two mini-speakers or earphones. The price of ""ReadIRlS"" [74] OCR software is under $150 and the ""TextAloud"" speech synthesis software is about $30 [75].  This project will be executed over two years at the City College of New York (CCNY) and Lighthouse International, New York. CCNY, located in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, is designated as both a Minority Institution and a Hispanic-serving Institution (37% Hispanic and 27% African American). Lighthouse International is a leading non-profit organization dedicated to preserving vision and to providing critically needed vision and rehabilitation services to help people of all ages overcome the challenges of vision loss. During the two years, we will 1) develop new algorithms to recognize text from backgrounds with multiple different colors; 2) develop new algorithms to recognize text from non-flat surfaces; and 3) develop a cost-effective prototype reading system for blind users by integrating with off-the-shelf optical character recognition (OCR) and speech-synthesis software products. The effectiveness of the prototype and algorithms will be evaluated by people with normal vision and people with vision impairment. A database of text on complex backgrounds (multiple colors and non-flat surfaces) will be created for algorithm and system evaluation. The database will be made available to research communities in the areas of computer vision and vision rehabilitation science. In summary, this effort will provide a research-based foundation to inform the design of next generation reading assistants for blind persons, as well as produce a practical prototype to help the blind user read text from complex backgrounds in real-world environments. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of the proposed research is to develop new computer vision algorithms for camera-based text recognition from complex backgrounds and non-flat surfaces, as well as produce a practical reading system prototype in combination with off-the-shelf  optical character recognition (OCR) and speech-synthesis software products, to help blind or visually impaired people read instructions on vending machines, titles of books aligned on a shelf, labels on medicine bottles or soup cans, etc. Visual information will be captured via a head-mounted camera (on sunglasses or hat) and analyzed in realtime through a portable computer, such as a mini laptop or a personal digital assistant (PDA).

"A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system based on standard camera cell phones to give blind and visually impaired persons the ability to read appliance displays and similar forms of non-document visual information. This ability is increasingly necessary to use everyday appliances such as microwave ovens and DVD players, and to perform many daily activities such as counting paper money. No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents. Our proposed software runs on a standard, off-the- shelf camera phone and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze images taken by the user, to detect and read the text within each image, and to then read it aloud using synthesized speech. Preliminary feasibility studies indicate that current cellular phones easily exceed the minimum processing power required for these tasks. Initially, the software will read out three categories of symbols: LED/LCD appliance displays, product or user-defined barcodes, and denominations of paper money. Ultimately these functions will be integrated with other capabilities being developed under separate funding, such as reading a broad range of printed text (including signs), recognizing objects, and analyzing photographs and graphics, etc., all available as free or low-cost software downloads for any cell phone user. Our specific goals are to (1) gather a database of real images taken by blind and visually impaired persons of a variety of LED/LCD appliance displays, barcodes and US paper currency; (2) develop algorithms to process the images and extract the desired information; (3) implement the algorithms on a camera phone; and (4) conduct user testing to establish design parameters and optimize the human interface. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays, and to other types of text and symbolic information hitherto unaddressed by rehabilitation technology. The proposed research would result in an assistive technology system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to provide increased access to such display and non- document text information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.          n/a",A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons,7799708,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Auditory', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Electronics', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Lavandula', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Memory', 'Modification', 'Paper', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Voice', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'design', 'image processing', 'meetings', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'optical character recognition', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation technology', 'response', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'visual information', 'web site']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2010,427932,0.10918522435728964
"A Cell Phone-based Sign Reader for Blind & Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop and evaluate a cell-phone-based system to enable blind and visually impaired individuals to find and read street signs and other signs relevant to wayfinding. Using the built-in camera and computing power of a standard cell phone, the system will process images captured by the user to find and analyze signs, and speak their contents. This will provide valuable assistance for blind or visually impaired pedestrians in finding and reading street signs, as well as locating and identifying addresses and store names, without requiring them to carry any special-purpose hardware. The sign finding and reading software will be made freely available for download into any camera-equipped cell phone that uses the widespread Symbian operating system (such as the popular Nokia cell phone series). We will build on our prior and ongoing work in applying computer vision techniques to practical problem-solving for blind persons, including cell-phone implementation of algorithms for indoor wayfinding and for reading digital appliance displays. We will develop, refine and transfer to the cell phone platform a new belief propagation-based algorithm that has shown preliminary success in finding and analyzing signs under difficult real-world conditions including partial shadow coverage. Human factors studies will help determine how to configure the system and its user controls for maximum effectiveness and ease of use, and provide an evaluation of the overall system. Access to environmental labels, signs or landmarks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task. The proposed research would result in a highly accessible system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to augment existing wayfinding techniques, which could dramatically improve independent travel for blind and visually impaired persons.          n/a",A Cell Phone-based Sign Reader for Blind & Visually Impaired Persons,7911722,R01EY018210,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Belief', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Figs - dietary', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Left', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Modification', 'Names', 'Operating System', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'legally blind', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'way finding', 'web site']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2010,423145,0.07201430854595188
"Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Handsight is a mobile phone service that offers an affordable, extensible set of automated sight-assistant functions to millions of blind and low-vision persons at $30/month atop standard voice and data fees. To the user, Handsight is simply a mobile phone application, requiring no special equipment or updating. By aiming a mobile telephone<s camera in roughly the right direction and pressing just one button, a Handsight user can snap a picture, send it to the Handsight computer center along with location data, and have a response within seconds. Moving the key computation and data from the handset to web servers cut cost, eases technology upgrades, and enables numerous data and technology partnerships needed to rapidly solve a broad spectrum of tasks. To allow widespread adoption Handsight uses voice, keypad, and vibration for user interaction; and for extensibility it is built on open-source software both on the handset and on the web application infrastructure. The range of tasks encountered by the blind and low-vision requires an array of components to solve: some are more heavily text-oriented and involve no location/navigational feedback (distinguishing and identifying different medicines; finding the phone bill in a stack of letters); some are more specifically navigational (locating the exact store entrance, finding the bus stop); yet others are informational (finding out when the next bus is due). Since we aim to provide a broadly useful tool, Handsight has to accommodate the whole range of task types. We are therefore proposing to build an architecture that integrates a set of components addressing the various task types, from text-detection and recognition software to navigational databases. Handsight<s application programming interface (API) will enable third parties to add capabilities to solve new tasks. As a web service, Handsight can evolve as computer vision and navigation technologies advance without requiring users to upgrade handsets or buy new versions of software. Phase I of this project was funded by the Dept. of Education / NIDRR and completed successfully between 10/01/2007 and 04/01/2008 under grant # H133S070044. It demonstrated not just the viability of the proposed project but also likely demand for such a service. (The NIDRR<s immutable deadlines precluded us from pursuing a Phase II with that agency.) Phase II consists in building the cell phone application and remote processing infrastructure with APIs to enable plug-in of the basic and future features. Subcontractor Smith-Kettlewell Institute for Eye Research will assure usability by blind and low-vision users; data partner NAVTEQ will provide a range of leading-edge digital map data. Blindsight already owns fast, accurate text detection and recognition software, and has experience in building scalable web services. A minimum set of features that make for a system with widespread appeal will be developed and/or licensed, and integrated into the service.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Handsight service falls squarely in the NEI mission to support research and programs with respect to visual disorders and the special health problems and requirements of the blind. It aims to provide a maximum of mobility and independence to the blind and low-vision using today<s mobile phone infrastructure via automated web services, using a minimum of specialized hardware and training. The 3 million-plus blind and low-vision persons in the U.S. encounter barriers to such activities of daily living as travel, navigation, and shopping, reading and social interactions. The difficulty of recognizing when a friend is nearby, of finding a product in a grocery store, of making change or locating a destination building often require sighted friends or assistants to make these tasks possible. This is expensive, difficult to arrange, and increases dependence. The Handsight system will simplify or make possible to many a new set of tasks previously requiring human assistance or special-purpose devices.        Re: Project Title: Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision  FOA: PHS 2009-02 Omnibus Solicitation of the NIH, CDC, FDA and ACF for Small Business  Innovation Research Grant Applications (Parent SBIR [R43/R44])  Proposed project period: April 1, 2010 - March 31, 2012  Principal Investigator: Hallinan, Peter W.

"Computational Methods for Analysis of Mouth Shapes in Sign Languages    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Sign Language (ASL) grammar is specified by the manual sign (the hand) and by the nonmanual components (the face). These facial articulations perform significant semantic, prosodic, pragmatic, and syntactic functions. This proposal will systematically study mouth positions in ASL. Our hypothesis is that ASL mouth positions are more extensive than those used in speech. To study this hypothesis, this project is divided into three aims. In our first aim, we hypothesize that mouth positions are fundamental for the understanding of signs produced in context because they are very distinct from signs seen in isolation. To study this we have recently collected a database of ASL sentences and nonmanuals in over 3600 video clips from 20 Deaf native signers. Our experiments will use this database to identify potential mappings from visual to linguistic features. To successfully do this, our second aim is to design a set of shape analysis and discriminant analysis algorithms that can efficiently analyze the large number of frames in these video clips. The goal is to define a linguistically useful model, i.e., the smallest model that contains the main visual features from which further predictions can be made. Then, in our third aim, we will explore the hypothesis that the linguistically distinct mouth positions are also visually distinct. In particular, we will use the algorithms defined in the second aim to determine if distinct visual features are used to define different linguistic categories. This result will show whether linguistically meaningful mouth positions are not only necessary in ASL (as hypothesized in aim 1), but whether they are defined using non-overlapping visual features (as hypothesized in aim 3). These aims address a critical need. At present, the study of nonmanuals must be carried out manually, that is, the shape and position of each facial feature in each frame must be recorded by hand. Furthermore, to be able to draw conclusive results for the design of a linguistic model, it is necessary to study many video sequences of related sentences as produced by different signers. It has thus proven nearly impossible to continue this research manually. The algorithms designed in the course of this grant will facilitate this analysis of ASL nonmanuals and lead to better teaching materials.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world. The public benefit of our research includes: (1) the goal of a practical and useful device to enhance communication between Deaf and hearing people in a variety of settings; and (2) the removal of a barrier that prevents Deaf individuals from achieving their full potential. An understanding of the non-manuals will also change how ASL is taught, leading to an improvement in the training of teachers of the Deaf, sign language interpreters and instructors, and crucially parents of deaf children.           Project Narrative Deafness limits access to information, with consequent effects on academic achievement, personal integration, and life-long financial situation, and also inhibits valuable contributions by Deaf people to the hearing world.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision. We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our long-term goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals and to enhance safety for the elderly and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool in which environments (such as a hotel lobby, large classroom, or hospital reception area), could be simulated with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or obstacles, such as steps or benches, under differing lighting conditions. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments"". Our research plan has four specific goals: 1) Develop methods for predicting the physical levels of light reaching the eye in existing or planned architectural spaces. 2) Acquire performance data for normally sighted subjects with visual restrictions and people with low vision to investigate perceptual capabilities critical to visually-based mobility. 3) Develop models that can predict perceptual competence on tasks critical to visually-based mobility. 4) Demonstrate a proof-of-concept software tool that operates on design models from existing architectural design systems and is able to highlight potential obstacles to visual accessibility. The lead investigators in our partnership come from three institutions: University of Minnesota Gordon Legge, Daniel Kersten; University of Utah William Thompson, Peter Shirley, Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University Robert Shakespeare. This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the four areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), photometrically correct computer graphics (Shirley), and architectural design and lighting (Shakespeare).           n/a",Designing Visually Accessible Spaces,7777764,R01EY017835,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Blindness', 'Central Scotomas', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lobbying', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Photometry', 'Published Comment', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Safety', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Space Perception', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'design', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'luminance', 'model design', 'model development', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2010,527186,0.07868370022845347
"Mid-Level Vision Systems for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low vision is a significant reduction of visual function that cannot be fully corrected by ordinary lenses, medical treatment, or surgery. Aging, injuries, and diseases can cause low vision. Its leading causes and those of blindness, include cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), both of which are more prevalent in the elderly population. Our overarching goal is to develop devices to aid people with low vision. We propose to use techniques of computer vision and computational neuroscience to build systems that enhance natural images. We plan test these systems on normal people and visually impaired older adults, with and without AMD. We have three milestones to reach: 1) Our first milestone will be to develop a system for low-noise image-contrast enhancement, which should help with AMD, because it causes lower contrast sensitivity. 2) Our second milestone will be a system that extracts the main contours of images in a cortical-like manner. Superimposing these contours on images should help with contrast-sensitivity problems at occlusion boundaries. Diffusing regions inside contours should help with crowding problems prominent in AMD. 3) Our third milestone is to probe whether these systems can help people with low vision people. For this purpose, we plan to use a battery of search and recognition psychophysical tests tailor-made for AMD. We put together an interdisciplinary team.

"A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system based on standard camera cell phones to give blind and visually impaired persons the ability to read appliance displays and similar forms of non-document visual information. This ability is increasingly necessary to use everyday appliances such as microwave ovens and DVD players, and to perform many daily activities such as counting paper money. No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents. Our proposed software runs on a standard, off-the- shelf camera phone and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze images taken by the user, to detect and read the text within each image, and to then read it aloud using synthesized speech. Preliminary feasibility studies indicate that current cellular phones easily exceed the minimum processing power required for these tasks. Initially, the software will read out three categories of symbols: LED/LCD appliance displays, product or user-defined barcodes, and denominations of paper money. Ultimately these functions will be integrated with other capabilities being developed under separate funding, such as reading a broad range of printed text (including signs), recognizing objects, and analyzing photographs and graphics, etc., all available as free or low-cost software downloads for any cell phone user. Our specific goals are to (1) gather a database of real images taken by blind and visually impaired persons of a variety of LED/LCD appliance displays, barcodes and US paper currency; (2) develop algorithms to process the images and extract the desired information; (3) implement the algorithms on a camera phone; and (4) conduct user testing to establish design parameters and optimize the human interface. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays, and to other types of text and symbolic information hitherto unaddressed by rehabilitation technology. The proposed research would result in an assistive technology system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to provide increased access to such display and non- document text information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.          n/a",A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons,7589644,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Auditory', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Electronics', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Lavandula', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Memory', 'Modification', 'Paper', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Voice', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'design', 'image processing', 'meetings', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'optical character recognition', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation technology', 'response', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'visual information', 'web site']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2009,426946,0.10918522435728964
"A Cell Phone-based Sign Reader for Blind & Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop and evaluate a cell-phone-based system to enable blind and visually impaired individuals to find and read street signs and other signs relevant to wayfinding. Using the built-in camera and computing power of a standard cell phone, the system will process images captured by the user to find and analyze signs, and speak their contents. This will provide valuable assistance for blind or visually impaired pedestrians in finding and reading street signs, as well as locating and identifying addresses and store names, without requiring them to carry any special-purpose hardware. The sign finding and reading software will be made freely available for download into any camera-equipped cell phone that uses the widespread Symbian operating system (such as the popular Nokia cell phone series). We will build on our prior and ongoing work in applying computer vision techniques to practical problem-solving for blind persons, including cell-phone implementation of algorithms for indoor wayfinding and for reading digital appliance displays. We will develop, refine and transfer to the cell phone platform a new belief propagation-based algorithm that has shown preliminary success in finding and analyzing signs under difficult real-world conditions including partial shadow coverage. Human factors studies will help determine how to configure the system and its user controls for maximum effectiveness and ease of use, and provide an evaluation of the overall system.

"A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impared Pedestrians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urban intersections are the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel. They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult. To alleviate this problem, we propose to develop and evaluate a cell phone-based system to analyze images of street intersections, taken by a blind or visually impaired person using a standard camera cell phone, to provide real-time feedback. Drawing on our recent work on computer vision algorithms that help a blind person find crosswalks and other important features in a street intersection, as well as our ongoing work on cell phone implementations of algorithms for indoor wayfinding and for reading digital appliance displays, we will refine these algorithms and implement them on a cell phone. The information extracted by the algorithms will be communicated to the user with a combination of synthesized speech, audio tones and/or tactile feedback (using the cell phone's built-in vibrator). Human factors studies will help determine how to configure the system and its user controls for maximum effectiveness and ease of use, and provide an evaluation of the overall system. The street intersection analysis software will be made freely available for download into any camera-equipped cell phone that uses the widespread Symbian operating system (such as the popular Nokia cell phone series). The cell phone will not need any hardware modifications or add-ons to run this software.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision. We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our long-term goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals and to enhance safety for the elderly and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool in which environments (such as a hotel lobby, large classroom, or hospital reception area), could be simulated with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or obstacles, such as steps or benches, under differing lighting conditions. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments"". Our research plan has four specific goals: 1) Develop methods for predicting the physical levels of light reaching the eye in existing or planned architectural spaces. 2) Acquire performance data for normally sighted subjects with visual restrictions and people with low vision to investigate perceptual capabilities critical to visually-based mobility. 3) Develop models that can predict perceptual competence on tasks critical to visually-based mobility. 4) Demonstrate a proof-of-concept software tool that operates on design models from existing architectural design systems and is able to highlight potential obstacles to visual accessibility. The lead investigators in our partnership come from three institutions: University of Minnesota Gordon Legge, Daniel Kersten; University of Utah William Thompson, Peter Shirley, Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University Robert Shakespeare. This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the four areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), photometrically correct computer graphics (Shirley), and architectural design and lighting (Shakespeare).           n/a",Designing Visually Accessible Spaces,7586102,R01EY017835,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Blindness', 'Central Scotomas', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lobbying', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Photometry', 'Published Comment', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Safety', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Space Perception', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'depressed', 'design', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'luminance', 'model design', 'model development', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2009,522802,0.07868370022845347
"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state. In patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central areas of the retina are damaged, creating a large blind spot that forces them to rely solely on residual vision in the periphery. Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency. The development of the model has naturally motivated fundamental experimental questions about eye movements and neural decision making. The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general. We will then apply the model framework to investigate differences in eye movement behavior between AMD patients and normally-sighted individuals. The interplay of model development and experimental investigation will significantly increase our knowledge of how humans use prior knowledge and task demands to direct their gaze, and how new visual information is incorporated into an eye movement plan. The results will have broad relevance to understanding neural decision making in general.   Relevance to Public Health. The application of the model to a clinical population will bring much-needed objective measures to understanding the extent of impairment in individuals with AMD. With this understanding comes great potential for improving rehabilitation training strategies that will enhance the quality of life for these patients and their families.          n/a",CRCNS: Where to look next?

"Mid-Level Vision Systems for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low vision is a significant reduction of visual function that cannot be fully corrected by ordinary lenses, medical treatment, or surgery. Aging, injuries, and diseases can cause low vision. Its leading causes and those of blindness, include cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), both of which are more prevalent in the elderly population. Our overarching goal is to develop devices to aid people with low vision. We propose to use techniques of computer vision and computational neuroscience to build systems that enhance natural images. We plan test these systems on normal people and visually impaired older adults, with and without AMD. We have three milestones to reach: 1) Our first milestone will be to develop a system for low-noise image-contrast enhancement, which should help with AMD, because it causes lower contrast sensitivity. 2) Our second milestone will be a system that extracts the main contours of images in a cortical-like manner. Superimposing these contours on images should help with contrast-sensitivity problems at occlusion boundaries. Diffusing regions inside contours should help with crowding problems prominent in AMD. 3) Our third milestone is to probe whether these systems can help people with low vision people. For this purpose, we plan to use a battery of search and recognition psychophysical tests tailor-made for AMD. We put together an interdisciplinary team. The Principal Investigator is Dr. Norberto Grzywacz from Biomedical Engineering at USC. Drs. Gerard Medioni from Computer Science and Bartlett Mel from Biomedical Engineering at USC will lead the efforts in Specific Aims 1 and 2 respectively. Drs. Bosco Tjan from USC Psychology, Susana Chung from the University of Houston, and Eli Peli from Harvard Medical School will lead Specific Aim 3. Other scientists are from USC. They include Dr. Irving Biederman from Psychology, an object-recognition expert and Dr. Mark Humayun, from Ophthalmology, an AMD expert.

"A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system based on standard camera cell phones to give blind and visually impaired persons the ability to read appliance displays and similar forms of non-document visual information. This ability is increasingly necessary to use everyday appliances such as microwave ovens and DVD players, and to perform many daily activities such as counting paper money. No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents. Our proposed software runs on a standard, off-the- shelf camera phone and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze images taken by the user, to detect and read the text within each image, and to then read it aloud using synthesized speech. Preliminary feasibility studies indicate that current cellular phones easily exceed the minimum processing power required for these tasks. Initially, the software will read out three categories of symbols: LED/LCD appliance displays, product or user-defined barcodes, and denominations of paper money. Ultimately these functions will be integrated with other capabilities being developed under separate funding, such as reading a broad range of printed text (including signs), recognizing objects, and analyzing photographs and graphics, etc., all available as free or low-cost software downloads for any cell phone user. Our specific goals are to (1) gather a database of real images taken by blind and visually impaired persons of a variety of LED/LCD appliance displays, barcodes and US paper currency; (2) develop algorithms to process the images and extract the desired information; (3) implement the algorithms on a camera phone; and (4) conduct user testing to establish design parameters and optimize the human interface. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays, and to other types of text and symbolic information hitherto unaddressed by rehabilitation technology. The proposed research would result in an assistive technology system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to provide increased access to such display and non- document text information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.          n/a",A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons,7446299,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Auditory', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Count', 'Custom', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Electronics', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Lavandula', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Memory', 'Modification', 'Paper', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Voice', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'design', 'desire', 'image processing', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'optical character recognition', 'prevent', 'programs', 'rehabilitation technology', 'response', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'visual information']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2008,421791,0.10918522435728964
"A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impared Pedestrians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urban intersections are the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel. They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult. To alleviate this problem, we propose to develop and evaluate a cell phone-based system to analyze images of street intersections, taken by a blind or visually impaired person using a standard camera cell phone, to provide real-time feedback. Drawing on our recent work on computer vision algorithms that help a blind person find crosswalks and other important features in a street intersection, as well as our ongoing work on cell phone implementations of algorithms for indoor wayfinding and for reading digital appliance displays, we will refine these algorithms and implement them on a cell phone. The information extracted by the algorithms will be communicated to the user with a combination of synthesized speech, audio tones and/or tactile feedback (using the cell phone's built-in vibrator). Human factors studies will help determine how to configure the system and its user controls for maximum effectiveness and ease of use, and provide an evaluation of the overall system. The street intersection analysis software will be made freely available for download into any camera-equipped cell phone that uses the widespread Symbian operating system (such as the popular Nokia cell phone series). The cell phone will not need any hardware modifications or add-ons to run this software. Ultimately a user will be able to download an entire suite of such algorithms for free onto the cell phone he or she is already likely to be carrying, without having to carry a separate piece of equipment for each function.

"A Smart Telescope for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to build and test a ""Smart Telescope,"" a device for persons with low vision that uses computer vision algorithms to search for, detect and enhance targets such as text and faces to aid in everyday tasks such as travel, navigation and social interactions. The practical, cosmetically acceptable packaging will consist of a miniature camera and visual display discreetly mounted on spectacles or a hat, and a compact computing device and set of controls that fit into a pocket. The Smart Telescope advances today's state of the art in assistive devices for low vision by automatically searching for, detecting and enhancing target objects even when they fill only a small portion of the device's field of view, without the user having to point the device directly or accurately at the target as with optical telescopes. The Smart Telescope is small and lightweight, but large enough for the elderly to handle and control; simple to operate and easy to carry, store, recharge, don and remove. Advanced options are hidden during day-to-day use, but easy to access when necessary. In Phase I, we developed and evaluated a working prototype and received enthusiastic feedback from subjects in our target population. In Phase II we propose to prototype a commercially viable consumer version of the Smart Telescope. The Phase II work plan has four tracks: 1) User interaction and interface design, 2) physical design and configuration, 3) software design and development, and 4) hardware design and development. Smith-Kettlewell's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) will provide expertise for the human factors portions of the project. Blindsight will design and build the device hardware from off-the-shelf components with the help of Bolton Engineering. Low vision experts Drs. Don Fletcher, Melissa Chun and Ian Bailey will work with the RERC to guarantee a practical product for the target audience. The overall aim is to create a commercial version of the proposed device for persons with reduced visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, or other loss of visual function caused by macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems, increasing mobility and independence for those with acuity between approximately 20/200 and 20/600. At under $1,000, the total market for such a device is estimated at up to 300,000, i.e., 10% of low vision persons in the United States. The commercial version of the Smart Telescope will significantly increase mobility and independence for persons with visual acuity between approximately 20/200 and 20/600, aiding them in everyday tasks such as travel, navigation, and social interactions. It will advance today's state of the art in assistive devices for low vision by improving on and surpassing the capabilities of the traditional optical telescope, greatly benefiting persons with reduced visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, or other loss of visual function caused by macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems.          n/a",A Smart Telescope for Low Vision,7486800,R44EY014487,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Cataract', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Eyeglasses', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glaucoma', 'Human', 'Macular degeneration', 'Marketing', 'Melissa', 'Optics', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Research', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Interaction', 'Software Design', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Today', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'day', 'design', 'improved', 'low vision telescope', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation engineering']",NEI,BLINDSIGHT CORPORATION,R44,2008,434041,0.09104431163183599
"Webcam Interface for Audio/touch Graphics Access by Blind People    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to develop a compact inexpensive alternative to the bulky expensive touchpads now required by blind people for audio/touch access to graphical information. Audio/touch is known to provide excellent access to computer-literate blind people as well as people with dyslexia or other severe print disabilities. Preparing Audio/touch materials was very expensive until ViewPlus introduced the IVEO Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) Authoring/conversion software in 2005. IVEO permits virtually any graphical information to be created or converted/imported easily to a well- structured highly accessible SVG format. Tactile copy was also very expensive before 2000 when ViewPlus introduced the Tiger embossing Windows printers that ""print"" by embossing. The new ViewPlus Emprint printer/embossers emboss and also print color images, creating color tactile images particularly useful for people with dyslexia and a number of other print disabilities. An audio/touch user reads an IVEO SVG graphic using the free IVEO Viewer, a tactile copy of the image, and a touchpad. The user places the tactile graphic on the touchpad and presses a point of interest. The touchpad communicates the position of that point back to the computer, and the IVEO Viewer speaks the appropriate information. Tactile text made from mainstream graphics has a distinctive pattern. When a user presses, that text is spoken by the IVEO Viewer. When the user presses a graphic object having a SVG title within the file, that title will be spoken. Objects may also have arbitrarily long description fields that can be spoken and browsed. All spoken information can be displayed on an attached braille display if desired. Graphical information is ubiquitous today, but almost none is accessible to blind people. Government agencies, libraries, companies, and agencies serving people with disabilities could easily send highly accessible IVEO graphics files and tactile graphic copies to clients with disabilities, but there is a ""chicken and egg"" dilemma that must be overcome before they are likely to do so. Few blind people have a touchpad (which cost $500 or more), so few could use that information. The specific aim of this Phase I proposal is to develop an affordable webcam-based prototype as an alternative to touchpads. It is based on an inexpensive webcam that is focused on the graphic and follows a finger. A touchpad press is emulated in this prototype by pressing some computer key with the other hand. This project could be the key to bringing accessible graphics to all blind computer users and is clearly of interest to NEI whose mission statement includes mental health and quality of life of blind people. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposal is relevant to the mission of the National Eye Institute, because it could be the key to making nearly all graphical information easily accessible to people who are blind or have other severe print disabilities. Graphical information is ubiquitous in the world today but is not presently accessible to blind people except through expensive and time-consuming conversion by trained transcribers. Making all graphical information accessible would have an obviously highly beneficial direct effect on education and professional opportunities, mental health, and quality of life of blind people. Mental health and quality of life issues for blind people are parts of the mission of the National Eye Institute.          n/a",Webcam Interface for Audio/touch Graphics Access by Blind People,7480812,R43EY018973,"['Back', 'Braille Display', 'Businesses', 'Chickens', 'Client', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Dyslexia', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'National Eye Institute', 'Numbers', 'Oregon', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Printing', 'Professional Education', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Structure of nail of finger', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tigers', 'Time', 'Title', 'Today', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'desire', 'digital', 'disability', 'egg', 'interest', 'literate', 'print disabilities', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'touchpad', 'vector']",NEI,"VIEWPLUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2008,100001,0.03834240096948695
"Indoor Magnetic Wayfinding For The Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced Medical Electronics (AME) proposes the development of an indoor way-finding device utilizing the unique magnetic anomaly patterns that exist in modern, man-made structures. The proposed system will record the magnitude of magnetic field strength from sensors in three orthogonal axes. The time history of these magnetic data points can be continuously compared with an electronic map of magnetic anomalies (or, ""signature"") to determine current position within a building. The phase I developed prototype system tracked in feasibility experiments with an accuracy of 1 foot (radius). Magnetic anomalies render a magnetic compass useless for finding a directional bearing. However, these same invisible anomalies represent valuable, unique indoor terrain features measurable by magnetic sensors located inside a small, portable device. Such a device would be able to provide low-vision users with a valuable indoor low-cost way-finding tool analogous to a Global Positioning System (GPS) device used outdoors. About 3.7 million Americans are visually disabled. Of these, 200,000 are blind, and the rest have low vision. The key advantage of the way-finding concept presented in this proposal, over other methods, is that the benefits are made available to the visually impaired community without requiring expensive building infrastructure investments. This is of particular advantage to large government buildings and educational campuses.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision. We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our long-term goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals and to enhance safety for the elderly and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool in which environments (such as a hotel lobby, large classroom, or hospital reception area), could be simulated with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or obstacles, such as steps or benches, under differing lighting conditions. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments"". Our research plan has four specific goals: 1) Develop methods for predicting the physical levels of light reaching the eye in existing or planned architectural spaces. 2) Acquire performance data for normally sighted subjects with visual restrictions and people with low vision to investigate perceptual capabilities critical to visually-based mobility. 3) Develop models that can predict perceptual competence on tasks critical to visually-based mobility. 4) Demonstrate a proof-of-concept software tool that operates on design models from existing architectural design systems and is able to highlight potential obstacles to visual accessibility.

This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the four areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), photometrically correct computer graphics (Shirley), and architectural design and lighting (Shakespeare).           n/a",Designing Visually Accessible Spaces,7351808,R01EY017835,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lobbying', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Photometry', 'Published Comment', 'Range', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Safety', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Space Models', 'Space Perception', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'concept', 'design', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'luminance', 'model design', 'model development', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2008,482736,0.07868370022845347
"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state. In patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central areas of the retina are damaged, creating a large blind spot that forces them to rely solely on residual vision in the periphery. Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency. The development of the model has naturally motivated fundamental experimental questions about eye movements and neural decision making. The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general. We will then apply the model framework to investigate differences in eye movement behavior between AMD patients and normally-sighted individuals. The interplay of model development and experimental investigation will significantly increase our knowledge of how humans use prior knowledge and task demands to direct their gaze, and how new visual information is incorporated into an eye movement plan. The results will have broad relevance to understanding neural decision making in general.   Relevance to Public Health. The application of the model to a clinical population will bring much-needed objective measures to understanding the extent of impairment in individuals with AMD. With this understanding comes great potential for improving rehabilitation training strategies that will enhance the quality of life for these patients and their families.          n/a",CRCNS: Where to look next?

"Computer Vision Methods for the Real Time Assessment of Dietary Intake    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S. Self- monitoring of all foods and beverages consumed is central to weight loss and maintenance efforts; however, this places a heavy burden on the user. These same burdens also impede nutritional research. The proposed research is for the testing of a semi-automated, objective, near real-time computer vision and pattern recognition approach to the measurement of dietary intake. In the proposed product, cell phone pictures of meals and snacks will be analyzed by software in an attempt to automatically recognize as many items as possible. A small number of intelligent yes/no questions will help provide additional information when necessary in order to meet the accuracy demands of the target application. Following identification of the items, the software will estimate the portion sizes of all identified items. The experiments comprising this Phase I SBIR are (a) extract the most informative sets of features using a large number of food and beverage items taken from an existing database of real world meal images, (b) compare the accuracy of candidate pattern recognition approaches to identify items based on the extracted features, (c) identify the most feasible algorithms for estimating portion size, and (d) test usability and user acceptance with a simulated version of the product. Phase II will (a) apply the approach to a greater variety of food and beverage items, (b) improve automated analysis, and (c) compare the approach to existing assessment instruments.

"Mid-Level Vision Systems for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low vision is a significant reduction of visual function that cannot be fully corrected by ordinary lenses, medical treatment, or surgery. Aging, injuries, and diseases can cause low vision. Its leading causes and those of blindness, include cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), both of which are more prevalent in the elderly population. Our overarching goal is to develop devices to aid people with low vision. We propose to use techniques of computer vision and computational neuroscience to build systems that enhance natural images. We plan test these systems on normal people and visually impaired older adults, with and without AMD. We have three milestones to reach: 1) Our first milestone will be to develop a system for low-noise image-contrast enhancement, which should help with AMD, because it causes lower contrast sensitivity. 2) Our second milestone will be a system that extracts the main contours of images in a cortical-like manner. Superimposing these contours on images should help with contrast-sensitivity problems at occlusion boundaries. Diffusing regions inside contours should help with crowding problems prominent in AMD. 3) Our third milestone is to probe whether these systems can help people with low vision people. For this purpose, we plan to use a battery of search and recognition psychophysical tests tailor-made for AMD. We put together an interdisciplinary team. The Principal Investigator is Dr. Norberto Grzywacz from Biomedical Engineering at USC. Drs. Gerard Medioni from Computer Science and Bartlett Mel from Biomedical Engineering at USC will lead the efforts in Specific Aims 1 and 2 respectively. Drs. Bosco Tjan from USC Psychology, Susana Chung from the University of Houston, and Eli Peli from Harvard Medical School will lead Specific Aim 3. Other scientists are from USC. They include Dr. Irving Biederman from Psychology, an object-recognition expert and Dr. Mark Humayun, from Ophthalmology, an AMD expert.

"A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impared Pedestrians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urban intersections are the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel. They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult. To alleviate this problem, we propose to develop and evaluate a cell phone-based system to analyze images of street intersections, taken by a blind or visually impaired person using a standard camera cell phone, to provide real-time feedback. Drawing on our recent work on computer vision algorithms that help a blind person find crosswalks and other important features in a street intersection, as well as our ongoing work on cell phone implementations of algorithms for indoor wayfinding and for reading digital appliance displays, we will refine these algorithms and implement them on a cell phone. The information extracted by the algorithms will be communicated to the user with a combination of synthesized speech, audio tones and/or tactile feedback (using the cell phone's built-in vibrator). Human factors studies will help determine how to configure the system and its user controls for maximum effectiveness and ease of use, and provide an evaluation of the overall system. The street intersection analysis software will be made freely available for download into any camera-equipped cell phone that uses the widespread Symbian operating system (such as the popular Nokia cell phone series). The cell phone will not need any hardware modifications or add-ons to run this software. Ultimately a user will be able to download an entire suite of such algorithms for free onto the cell phone he or she is already likely to be carrying, without having to carry a separate piece of equipment for each function. Relevance: The ability to walk safely and confidently along sidewalks and traverse crosswalks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task. The proposed research would result in a highly accessible system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to augment existing wayfinding techniques, which could dramatically improve independent travel for blind and visually impaired persons.           n/a",A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impared Pedestrians,7298706,R01EY018345,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Figs - dietary', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Left', 'Light', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Modification', 'Operating System', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Zebra', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'day', 'digital', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'legally blind', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'skills', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'way finding']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2007,338243,0.022222752396393142
"Wayfinding for the blind & visually impaired using passive environmental labels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to tackle the problem of way finding (finding one's way in an environment), faced by blind and severely visually impaired persons who are unable to find or read signs, landmarks and locations. We propose a novel and very inexpensive environmental labeling system to provide this population with access to information needed for indoor way finding (where GPS is not available). The system uses simple passive landmark symbols printed on paper or other material, placed next to text, Braille signs or barcode at locations of interest (offices, bathrooms, etc.) in an environment such as an office building. These printed patterns contain spatial and semantic information that is detected using computer vision algorithms running on a standard camera cell phone. By scanning the environment with the device, which detects all landmark symbols in its line of sight up to distances of 10 meters, the user can determine his or her approximate location in the environment as well as the information encoded near each landmark symbol. The system extracts this information in real-time and communicates it to the user by sound, synthesized speech and/or tactile feedback. This information includes spatial (e.g. audio tones to indicate the presence and direction of a label in the camera's field of view) and semantic information (""Mr. Johnson's office, room 429, at 11 o'clock""). The research proposed here will produce a prototype system that will be tested by blind and low vision subjects. Our team includes a blind expert on psychoacoustics (and other in-house blind staff) and an expert consultant on low-vision way finding and navigation to help optimize the user interface and guide development into a practical, easy-to-use system.              n/a",Wayfinding for the blind & visually impaired using passive environmental labels,7295688,R21EY017003,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Auditory', 'Bar Codes', 'Canes', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clutterings', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Complement component C1s', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Consultations', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Label', 'Localized', 'Location', 'Modality', 'Museums', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Psychoacoustics', 'Quality of life', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'interest', 'legally blind', 'meter', 'novel', 'optical character recognition', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research study', 'size', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'symposium', 'way finding']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2007,193398,0.06731069336154316
"A Smart Telescope for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to build and test a ""Smart Telescope,"" a device for persons with low vision that uses computer vision algorithms to search for, detect and enhance targets such as text and faces to aid in everyday tasks such as travel, navigation and social interactions. The practical, cosmetically acceptable packaging will consist of a miniature camera and visual display discreetly mounted on spectacles or a hat, and a compact computing device and set of controls that fit into a pocket. The Smart Telescope advances today's state of the art in assistive devices for low vision by automatically searching for, detecting and enhancing target objects even when they fill only a small portion of the device's field of view, without the user having to point the device directly or accurately at the target as with optical telescopes. The Smart Telescope is small and lightweight, but large enough for the elderly to handle and control; simple to operate and easy to carry, store, recharge, don and remove. Advanced options are hidden during day-to-day use, but easy to access when necessary. In Phase I, we developed and evaluated a working prototype and received enthusiastic feedback from subjects in our target population. In Phase II we propose to prototype a commercially viable consumer version of the Smart Telescope. The Phase II work plan has four tracks: 1) User interaction and interface design, 2) physical design and configuration, 3) software design and development, and 4) hardware design and development. Smith-Kettlewell's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) will provide expertise for the human factors portions of the project. Blindsight will design and build the device hardware from off-the-shelf components with the help of Bolton Engineering. Low vision experts Drs. Don Fletcher, Melissa Chun and Ian Bailey will work with the RERC to guarantee a practical product for the target audience. The overall aim is to create a commercial version of the proposed device for persons with reduced visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, or other loss of visual function caused by macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems, increasing mobility and independence for those with acuity between approximately 20/200 and 20/600. At under $1,000, the total market for such a device is estimated at up to 300,000, i.e., 10% of low vision persons in the United States. The commercial version of the Smart Telescope will significantly increase mobility and independence for persons with visual acuity between approximately 20/200 and 20/600, aiding them in everyday tasks such as travel, navigation, and social interactions. It will advance today's state of the art in assistive devices for low vision by improving on and surpassing the capabilities of the traditional optical telescope, greatly benefiting persons with reduced visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, or other loss of visual function caused by macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems.          n/a",A Smart Telescope for Low Vision,7327116,R44EY014487,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Back', 'Cataract', 'Clutterings', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Eyeglasses', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glaucoma', 'Human', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'Macular degeneration', 'Marketing', 'Melissa', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Interaction', 'Software Design', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Today', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'day', 'design', 'improved', 'low vision telescope', 'monocular', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation engineering']",NEI,BLINDSIGHT CORPORATION,R44,2007,448477,0.09104431163183599
"Smart Wheelchair Component System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Independent mobility is critical to individuals of any age. While the needs of many individuals with disabilities can be satisfied with power wheelchairs, some members of the disabled community find it difficult or impossible to operate a standard power wheelchair. This population includes, but is not limited to, individuals with low vision, visual field neglect, spasticity, tremors, or cognitive deficits. The goal of this project is to develop a set of components that can be added to standard power wheelchairs to convert them into ""smart"" wheelchairs which can assist the user in navigation and obstacle avoidance. During Phase I, a prototype of the Smart Wheelchair Component System (SWCS) was developed from a laptop computer and a collection of sonar, infrared and bump sensors. The evaluation activities performed during Phase I demonstrated that the system is compatible with multiple brands of wheelchairs, can accept both continuous and switch-based input, and can support front-, mid-, and rear-wheel drive wheelchairs. During Phase II, we propose to refine the system hardware and software; replace the laptop computer with an embedded microprocessor; fabricate enclosures for the system components; and develop tools to support clinicians in installing and configuring the system. The system will be evaluated in tests involving potential users, clinicians, and wheelchair design standards. The final product will be a market-ready modular system which can be attached to a variety of standard power wheelchairs. This product has the potential to increase the independence and quality of life of many wheelchair users and potential wheelchair users whose disabilities limit their capacity for independent wheelchair navigation.       n/a",Smart Wheelchair Component System,7237214,R44HD040023,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Child', 'Client', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Compatible', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disadvantaged', 'Documentation', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Joystick', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microprocessor', 'Numbers', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Self Perception', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Travel', 'Tremor', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual impairment', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'base', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'laptop', 'member', 'neglect', 'peer', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'sonar', 'tool']",NICHD,AT SCIENCES,R44,2007,387828,0.043575610416976454
"Indoor Magnetic Wayfinding For The Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced Medical Electronics (AME) proposes the development of an indoor way-finding device utilizing the unique magnetic anomaly patterns that exist in modern, man-made structures. The proposed system will record the magnitude of magnetic field strength from sensors in three orthogonal axes. The time history of these magnetic data points can be continuously compared with an electronic map of magnetic anomalies (or, ""signature"") to determine current position within a building. The phase I developed prototype system tracked in feasibility experiments with an accuracy of 1 foot (radius). Magnetic anomalies render a magnetic compass useless for finding a directional bearing. However, these same invisible anomalies represent valuable, unique indoor terrain features measurable by magnetic sensors located inside a small, portable device. Such a device would be able to provide low-vision users with a valuable indoor low-cost way-finding tool analogous to a Global Positioning System (GPS) device used outdoors. About 3.7 million Americans are visually disabled. Of these, 200,000 are blind, and the rest have low vision. The key advantage of the way-finding concept presented in this proposal, over other methods, is that the benefits are made available to the visually impaired community without requiring expensive building infrastructure investments. This is of particular advantage to large government buildings and educational campuses.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision. We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our long-term goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals and to enhance safety for the elderly and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool in which environments (such as a hotel lobby, large classroom, or hospital reception area), could be simulated with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or obstacles, such as steps or benches, under differing lighting conditions. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments"". Our research plan has four specific goals: 1) Develop methods for predicting the physical levels of light reaching the eye in existing or planned architectural spaces. 2) Acquire performance data for normally sighted subjects with visual restrictions and people with low vision to investigate perceptual capabilities critical to visually-based mobility. 3) Develop models that can predict perceptual competence on tasks critical to visually-based mobility. 4) Demonstrate a proof-of-concept software tool that operates on design models from existing architectural design systems and is able to highlight potential obstacles to visual accessibility.

"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state.

Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency.

The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general.

"Sign Finder: Computer Vision to Find and Read Signs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build a device that enhances the mobility of visually impaired persons by finding and reading signs aloud without the need for infrastructure beyond ordinary signs. Using new computer vision techniques, it will detect and read text in images captured by a camera worn like a pendant around the user's neck.      We will build two commercially viable, self-contained consumer versions, a $1,500 device using consumer computers and cameras, and a $750 proprietary device.      In typical use, a wearer will select a mode (city street, supermarket) by pressing buttons and optionally speaking commands, and then either point the device at a scene, or scan the scene using auto-repeat image capture. The device will find and read signs, but only output audio for signs relevant to the mode.      The Phase II work plan has three tracks: 1) Computer vision software development and testing, 2) Human interface design and development, and 3) development and testing of the two forms of the device.

"Wayfinding for the blind & visually impaired using passive environmental labels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to tackle the problem of way finding (finding one's way in an environment), faced by blind and severely visually impaired persons who are unable to find or read signs, landmarks and locations. We propose a novel and very inexpensive environmental labeling system to provide this population with access to information needed for indoor way finding (where GPS is not available). The system uses simple passive landmark symbols printed on paper or other material, placed next to text, Braille signs or barcode at locations of interest (offices, bathrooms, etc.) in an environment such as an office building. These printed patterns contain spatial and semantic information that is detected using computer vision algorithms running on a standard camera cell phone. By scanning the environment with the device, which detects all landmark symbols in its line of sight up to distances of 10 meters, the user can determine his or her approximate location in the environment as well as the information encoded near each landmark symbol. The system extracts this information in real-time and communicates it to the user by sound, synthesized speech and/or tactile feedback. This information includes spatial (e.g. audio tones to indicate the presence and direction of a label in the camera's field of view) and semantic information (""Mr. Johnson's office, room 429, at 11 o'clock""). The research proposed here will produce a prototype system that will be tested by blind and low vision subjects. Our team includes a blind expert on psychoacoustics (and other in-house blind staff) and an expert consultant on low-vision way finding and navigation to help optimize the user interface and guide development into a practical, easy-to-use system.              n/a",Wayfinding for the blind & visually impaired using passive environmental labels,7143942,R21EY017003,"['clinical research', 'computers', 'reading', 'semantics', 'touch', 'vision']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2006,224601,0.06731069336154316
"Traffic Intersection Analysis Algorithms for the Blind DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to explore, develop and test computer vision algorithms to analyze images of street intersections from a camera worn by a blind person.  Urban intersections are the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel.  They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult.  We will explore computer vision algorithms to help a blind person find the crosswalk, find the pedestrian signal button, determine when the ""walk"" light is on, and alert him/her to any veering out of the crosswalk.  We will emphasize the development of completely novel methods of analyzing non-ideal images including shadows, occlusions and other irregularities using spatial grouping techniques based on Bayesian inference.  The resulting algorithms are intended for eventual integration as modules for a computer vision system we are already developing to help blind persons with travel tasks such as finding and reading aloud printed signs and negotiating street crossings.  The combined system would have potential for a radical advance in independent travel for blind persons.  In this exploratory project, we aim to: (1) Explore and test alternative approaches to algorithm design to process intersection images and extract the information about the crosswalk, crossing signal, etc., using a database of real-world images taken by blind persons at a variety of different kinds of intersections.  (2) Test the algorithms using a portable camera connected to a notebook computer with speech output. n/a",Traffic Intersection Analysis Algorithms for the Blind,7096566,R21EY015187,"['blind aid', 'blindness', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'gait', 'human subject', 'injury prevention', 'mathematical model', 'statistics /biometry', 'transportation /recreation safety', 'urban area']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2006,214738,0.06535875302130616
"Instrument development & fabrication for vision research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this proposal is to enhance the research capabilities and collaborative efforts of the vision researchers at the Columbia University Medical Center.  State-of-the-art vision research often requires the custom fabrication of mechanical instruments to support the research. Support is requested for a single module to renovate and support the machine shop in the Harkness Eye Institute at Columbia University, to be shared primarily between the Department of Ophthalmology and the Mahoney Center for Brain and Behavior.  The module will have 10 users, 7 of whom have NEI-funded RO1 grants, and 3 of whom perform research in the area of visual systems neuroscience on grants funded by the NIMH. All of the investigators are also mentors on an NEI-funded training grant. The current systems projects include studies of the neurophysiology   and psychophysics of spatial vision, visual attention, early cortical processing, visual emotional association, and visual motion; the cellular and molecular projects include studies of fluid transport across corneal epithelium, retinal axon guidance, ocular wound healing, and the impact of the lipofuscin fluorophores on retinal pigmented epithelial cell function and viability. All of these projects require the development and fabrication of devices primarily designed for a given project. A great number of these can, when perfected, be shared among a number of projects. Examples of such devices include custom-made nanoliter injection devices, recording chambers, multiple-microdrive platforms, dual recording-iontophoretic devices, illumination devices, and recording gdds. The PI has extensive experience collaborating with machinists, and several of the devices in whose development he participated have been marketed commercially.  Currently the Department of Ophthalmology has a fully-equipped machine shop the machines of which are all fine old Bridgeport and Hardinge manual machines. This proposal is to upgrade the machine shop, with a computer-controlled lathe and a computer-controlled milling machine, and to support the salary of the machinist who was hired in June, 2003, using university startup funds. The availability of an in-house professionally certified machinist will significantly speed the process of design and fabrication of custom instruments.  The use of computer controlled machine tools will facilitate duplication of instruments usable in multiple laboratories.            n/a",Instrument development & fabrication for vision research,7057358,R24EY015634,"['biomedical equipment', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical research', 'computers', 'neurosciences', 'vision']",NEI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R24,2006,180672,0.05102060181180179
"MobileEye OCR for the Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this SBIR we propose to demonstrate the technical feasibility of Mobile OCR, a portable software system which makes use of existing personal devices to provide access to textual materials for the elderly or the visually impaired. The system will help these low vision individuals with basic daily activities, such as shopping, preparing meals, taking medication, and reading traffic signs. It will step beyond our proposed MobileEyes vision enhancement system to apply cutting edge recognition technology for mobile devices. The system will use common camera phone hardware to capture and enhance textual information, perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and provide audio or visual feedback. Our research will focus on implementing and integrating new vision enhancement and analysis techniques on limited resource mobile devices. Specifically, we will develop algorithms for detection and rectification of text on planes and generalized cylinders subject to perspective distortions, implement more robust and efficient algorithms and systems for stabilization and enhancement of text blocks, provide mobile OCR on complex textured backgrounds, and implement these techniques on small devices across a variety of platforms. The recognized text will be presented through Text-to-Speech (TTS), or displayed on the device with enhanced quality which can be easily read by low vision users. Phase I will focus on demonstrating the technical feasibility of our approach, and will incorporate a performance measurement methodology to quantitatively evaluate progress and evaluate our system against other approaches. In comparison to existing vision enhancement devices, such as magnifying glasses, telescopes, and text reading devices such as scanner-based OCR, our solution has several advantages: 1) it makes use of a single, portable device (camera cell phone) that is commonly available and typically already carried for its telecommunications capabilities; 2) it can be used selectively by users so they will not be overwhelmed by irrelevant information; and 3) it can be integrated directly with other applications for specialized tasks. Our research results will impact the millions of low-vision individuals and the blind, as well as vision and computer vision researchers. Our team is uniquely qualified to explore the feasibility of extending visual applications to these devices, and provide a platform for integrating future vision algorithms.         n/a",MobileEye OCR for the Visually Impaired,7053650,R43EY017216,"['reading', 'solutions', 'vision']",NEI,"APPLIED MEDIA ANALYSIS, LLC",R43,2006,104935,0.1201679030342171
"A Smart Telescope for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to test the feasibility of a ""Smart Telescope"" for use to improve the ability of visually impaired persons in tasks such as travel, navigation and social interactions. Advances in low-power high-speed portable computers combined with novel computer vision algorithms enable us to build an affordable, portable, and cosmetically acceptable digital telescope that can enable visually impaired persons to perform these tasks with greater ease than with current telescopes.        The computer vision algorithms first detect regions of interest in an image where targets are likely to be, even if these targets occupy only a small portion of the visual field, obviating the need for a user to scan or search a scene as would be necessary with an ordinary telescope. Next, novel object-specific super-resolution enhancement algorithms use target-specific knowledge to magnify and enhance these regions so that users can interpret them, similar to pointing a telescope at those regions. Algorithms can then track the targets as the observer moves, and indicate their relative locations. Finally, like today's digital telescopes for   the low vision community, the Smart Telescope will output either to a monocular viewfinder display or to a bioptic display.      The project process involves: (1) Data collection and analysis (Iow-vision persons will be used to collect image data); (2) Detection, enhancement and tracking algorithm development; (3) Integration of algorithms with user interface, and (4) Testing human factors.      Our field prototypes will range in cost from approximately $3,000 to $5,000 each, while the target cost of a commercial version is under $1,000. Our price estimates are conservative, and we anticipate that the rapid development of computer technology will lower these costs substantially in the next few years.         n/a",A Smart Telescope for Low Vision,6995047,R43EY014487,"['artificial intelligence', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical research', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection', 'digital imaging', 'functional ability', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'patient oriented research', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'questionnaires', 'vision aid', 'vision disorders', 'visual fields', 'visual perception', 'visual threshold', 'visual tracking']",NEI,BLINDSIGHT CORPORATION,R43,2005,144106,0.11402876306711303

"Core Grant for Vision Research The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute is a private non-profit organization, founded to encourage a productive collaboration between the clinical and basic research communities. To further this objective, the Institutes incorporates visual scientists from diverse medical and scientific backgrounds: ophthalmology visual scientific backgrounds. In the past, research at this Institute was focused on topics related to strabismus and amblyopia (oculomoter processing, binocular vision, cortical development of t he visual pathways). While these research areas are still growing, other distinct specialties have emerged in recent years Vision in the aging eye, motion and long-range processing, analysis of retinal functioning, retinal development, object recognition and computer vision are among the new research interests.

"Locating and Reading Informational Signs  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to construct computer vision systems to enable the blind and severely visually impaired to detect and read informational text in city scenes. The informational text can be street signs, bus numbers hospital signs, supermarket signs, and names of products (eg. Kellogg's cornflakes). We will construct portable prototype computer vision systems implemented by digital cameras attached to personal, or hand held, computers. The camera need only be pointed in the general direction of the text (so the text is only one percent of the image). A speech synthesizer will read the text to the user. Blind and visually impaired users will test the device in the field (under supervision) and give feedback to improve the algorithms. We argue that this work will make a significant contribution to improving human health (rehabilitation). Computer vision is a rapidly maturing technology with immense potential to help the blind and visually impaired. Reports suggest that detecting and reading informational text is one of the main unsatisfied desires of these groups. Written signs and information in the environment are used for navigation, shopping, operating equipment, identifying buses, and many other purposes (to which a blind person does not otherwise have independent access). The blind and severely visually impaired make up a large fraction of the US population (3 million). Moreover, this proportion is expected to increase by a factor of two in the next ten years due to increased life expectancy. Our proposal is design-driven. It uses a new class of computer vision algorithms known as Data Driven Monte Carlo (DDMCMC). The algorithms are used to: (i) search for text, and (ii) to read it. Recent developments in digital cameras and portable/handheld computers make it practical to implement these algorithms in portable prototype systems. The three scientists in this proposal have the necessary expertise to accomplish it. Dr.'s Yuille and Zhu have backgrounds in computer vision and Dr. Brabyn has experience in developing and testing engineering systems to help the blind and visually impaired. Our proposal falls within the scope of the Bioengineering initiative because we are applying techniques from the mathematical/engineering sciences to develop informatic approaches for patient rehabilitation. More specifically, our work will facilitate the development of portable devices to help the blind and visually impaired.   n/a",Locating and Reading Informational Signs,6801171,R01EY013875,"['blind aid', 'blindness', 'clinical research', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'cues', 'human subject', 'reading', 'vision aid', 'vision disorders']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2004,329706,0.11876110689299786

"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are, they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms   2) Accommodative Mechanisms   3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms   There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term, we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause.

Advances in low-power high-speed portable computers combined with novel computer vision algorithms enable us to build an affordable, portable, and cosmetically acceptable digital telescope that can enable visually impaired persons to perform these tasks with greater ease than with current telescopes.        The computer vision algorithms first detect regions of interest in an image where targets are likely to be, even if these targets occupy only a small portion of the visual field, obviating the need for a user to scan or search a scene as would be necessary with an ordinary telescope. Next, novel object-specific super-resolution enhancement algorithms use target-specific knowledge to magnify and enhance these regions so that users can interpret them, similar to pointing a telescope at those regions. Algorithms can then track the targets as the observer moves, and indicate their relative locations. Finally, like today's digital telescopes for   the low vision community, the Smart Telescope will output either to a monocular viewfinder display or to a bioptic display.      The project process involves: (1) Data collection and analysis (Iow-vision persons will be used to collect image data); (2) Detection, enhancement and tracking algorithm development; (3) Integration of algorithms with user interface, and (4) Testing human factors.      Our field prototypes will range in cost from approximately $3,000 to $5,000 each, while the target cost of a commercial version is under $1,000.

"Locating and Reading Informational Signs  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to construct computer vision systems to enable the blind and severely visually impaired to detect and read informational text in city scenes. The informational text can be street signs, bus numbers hospital signs, supermarket signs, and names of products (eg. Kellogg's cornflakes). We will construct portable prototype computer vision systems implemented by digital cameras attached to personal, or hand held, computers. The camera need only be pointed in the general direction of the text (so the text is only one percent of the image). A speech synthesizer will read the text to the user. Blind and visually impaired users will test the device in the field (under supervision) and give feedback to improve the algorithms. We argue that this work will make a significant contribution to improving human health (rehabilitation). Computer vision is a rapidly maturing technology with immense potential to help the blind and visually impaired.

"SIGN FINDER: COMPUTER VISION TO FIND AND READ SIGNS In this Phase l proposal we plan to develop and test a new vision technology to locat and read general informational signs (street names, building directories, office door plates) and location and directional signs (EXIT, Information, aisle signs in supermarkets). To strengthen feasibility, we will target a restricted class of signs: those consisting primarily of one- color text on a different one-color background, and whose shape falls within a prescribed set. The intended market is for people who are blind or whose sight is impaired and hence cannot read these signs unaided. Our approach makes extensive use of recently developed computer vision recognition algorithms. We also make use of the Smith-Kettlewell's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center's expertise for determining what the potential users will require from such a system. The ultimate goal, for Phase II, is to build and test a highly portable PC- based device implementing this vision technology using a CCD camera as input and a voice-generator as output. The user would scan/point the device at a scene and it would locate and read one or more signs. Given the pace of increase in power and decrease in size of computing devices, a hand-held Sign-Finder system may be plausible to build entirely with commercial, off-the-shelf hardware in two to three years.

"A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication PROJECT SUMMARY We will develop novel computer vision tools to reliably and precisely measure nonverbal social communication through quantifying communicative facial and bodily expressions. Our tools will be designed and developed in order to maximize their usability by non-engineer behavioral scientists, filling the enormous gap between engineering advances and their clinical accessibility. Significance: Social interaction inherently relies on perception and production of coordinated face and body expressions. Indeed, atypical face and body movements are observed in many disorders, impacting social interaction and communication. Traditional systems for quantifying nonverbal communication (e.g., FACS, BAP) require extensive training and coding time. Their tedious coding requirements drastically limits their scalability and reproducibility. While an extensive literature exists on advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques for face and body analysis, there is no well-established method commonly used in mental health community to quantify production of facial and bodily expressions or efficiently capture individual differences in nonverbal communication in general. As a part of this proposal, we will develop a computer vision toolbox including tools that are both highly granular and highly scalable, to allow for measurement of complex social behavior in large and heterogeneous populations. Approach: Our team will develop tools that provide granular metrics of nonverbal social behavior, including localized face and body kinematics, characteristics of elicited expressions, and imitation performance. Our tools will facilitate measurement of social communication both within a person and between people, to allow for assessment of individual social communication cues as well as those that occur within bidirectional social contexts. Preliminary Data: We have developed and applied novel computer vision tools to assess: (1) diversity of mouth motion during conversational speech (effect size d=1.0 in differentiating young adults with and without autism during a brief natural conversation), (2) interpersonal facial coordination (91% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis in young adults during a brief natural conversation, replicated in an independent child sample), and (3) body action imitation (85% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis based on body imitation performance). As apart of current proposal, we will develop more generic methods that can be used in normative and clinical samples. Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop tools to automatically quantify fine-grained face movements and their coordination during facial expression production; in Aim 2, we will develop tools to quantify body joint kinematics and their coordination during bodily expression production; in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the tools’ ability to yield dimensional metrics using machine learning. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of nonverbal social communication, providing a scalable solution to measure individual variability, within a dimensional and transdiagnostic framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project develops novel tools for measuring nonverbal social communication as manifested through facial and bodily expressions. Using advanced computer vision and machine learning methodologies, we will quantify humans’ communicative social behavior. The results of this project will impact public health by facilitating a rich characterization of normative development of social functioning, providing access to precise phenotypic information for neuroscience and genetics studies, and by measuring subtle individual differences to determine whether some interventions or treatments work better than others.",A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication,9946780,R01MH122599,"['Adolescent', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Engineering', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral health', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'open source', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'tool', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2020,150000,0.012968451680997322
"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Summary The goal of this project is to develop a smartphone-based wayfinding app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate indoor environments more easily and independently. It harnesses computer vision and smartphone sensors to estimate and track the user’s location in real time relative to a map of the indoor environment, providing audio-based turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to a desired destination. An additional option is to provide audio or tactile alerts to the presence of nearby points of interest in the environment, such as exits, elevators, restrooms and meeting rooms. The app estimates the user’s location by recognizing standard informational signs present in the environment, tracking the user’s trajectory and relating it to a digital map that has been annotated with information about signs and landmarks. Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings.

During a single day, or as their disease progresses, they may transition from one access technology to another due to fatigue, medications, changing physical status, or progressive motor dysfunction. There are currently no clinical or AT solutions that adapt to the multiple, dynamic access needs of these individuals, leaving many people poorly served. This competitive renewal, called BCI-FIT (Brain Computer Interface-Functional Implementation Toolkit) adds to our innovative multidisciplinary translational research conducted over the past 11 years for the advancement of science related to non-invasive BCIs for communication for these clinical populations. BCI-FIT relies on active inference and transfer learning to customize a completely adaptive intent estimation classifier to each user's multiple modality signals in real-time. The BCI-FIT acronym has many implications: our BCI fits to each user's brain signals; to the environment, offering relevant personal language; to the user's internal states, adjusting signals based on drowsiness, medications, physical and cognitive abilities; and to users' learning patterns from BCI introduction to expert use.  Three specific aims are proposed: (1) Develop and evaluate methods for optimizing system and user performance with on-line, robust adaptation of multi-modal signal models. (2) Develop and evaluate methods for efficient user intent inference through active querying. (3) Integrate language interaction and letter/word supplementation as input modalities in real-time BCI use. Four single case experimental research designs will evaluate both user performance and technology performance for functional communication with 35 participants with SSPI in the community, and 30 healthy controls for preliminary testing. The same dependent variables will be tested in all experiments: typing accuracy (correct character selections divided by total character selections), information transfer rate (ITR), typing speed (correct characters/minute), and user experience (UX) questionnaire responses about comfort, workload, and satisfaction. Our goal is to establish individualized recommendations for each user based on a combination of clinical and machine expertise. The clinical expertise plus user feedback added to active sensor fusion and reinforcement learning for intent inference will produce optimized multi-modal BCIs for each end-user that can adjust to short- and long-term fluctuating function. Our research is conducted by four sub-teams who have collaborated successfully to implement translational science: Electrical/computer engineering; Neurophysiology and systems science; Natural language processing; and Clinical rehabilitation. The project is grounded in solid machine learning approaches with models of participatory action research and AAC participation. This project will improve technologies and BCI technical capabilities, demonstrate BCI implementation paradigms and clinical guidelines for people with severe disabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies, as proposed in BCI-FIT.

"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Abstract COVID-19 has made traveling as a blind or visually impaired person much riskier and more difficult than before the pandemic. As a result, people with visual impairments may limit their essential travel such as trips to the doctor’s office, the pharmacy and grocery shopping and walks for exercise or leisure. Accordingly, the goal of this COVID Supplement, which builds on and expands the work being conducted by the parent grant, is to develop a COVID map tool that provides fully accessible, non-visual access to maps. This tool will allow visually impaired persons to explore maps and preview routes from the comfort of their home, allowing them to plan their travel along safer, less congested routes using crowdedness data. In addition, the tool will present county-by-county COVID incidence data in a fully accessible form, which will inform their travel plans over greater distances. Thus, this project will give visually impaired persons the tools and confidence to undertake safer, more independent travel. Health Relevance The COVID-19 pandemic has an especially severe impact on people with significant vision impairments or blindness. The need for social distancing and reduced touching of one’s surroundings has made traveling as a blind or visually impaired person much riskier and more difficult than before the pandemic. As a result, people with visual impairments may limit their essential travel such as trips to the doctor’s office, the pharmacy and grocery shopping and walks for exercise or leisure. These travel limitations may have adverse impacts on their physical and mental health. The proposed research would result in a new software tool that could greatly increase the confidence of the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness to undertake safe, independent travel.",Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers,10220178,R01EY029033,"['American', 'Blindness', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cellular Phone', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'County', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Leisures', 'Maps', 'Mental Health', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Route', 'Running', 'Social Distance', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Target Populations', 'Touch sensation', 'Travel', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Walking', 'Work', 'blind', 'braille', 'coronavirus disease', 'design', 'outreach', 'pandemic disease', 'parent grant', 'physical conditioning', 'software development', 'symposium', 'tool', 'way finding']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,406525,0.07602267654029984
"SCH: INT: Conversations for Vision: Human-Computer Synergies in Prosthetic Interactions  The project will investigate prosthetic support for people with visual impairment (PVI) that integrates computer vision-based prosthetics with video-mediated human-in-the-loop prosthetics. Computer vision- based (CV) prosthetics construe the fundamental technical challenge for visual prosthetics as one of parsing and identifying objects across scales, distances, and orientations. Visual prosthetic applications have been central drivers in the development of computer vision technology through the past 50 years. Video-mediated remote sighted assistance (RSA) prosthetics are more recent, enabled by different technologies, and construe the orienting technical challenge for visual prosthetics as one of effective helping interactions. RSA services are commercially available now, and have evoked much excitement in the PVI community. The two approaches, CV and RSA, will be successively integrated through a series of increasingly refined Wizard of Oz simulations, and investigate possible synergies between the two approaches. We will employ a human-centered design approach, identifying a set of key assistive interaction scenarios that represent authentic needs and concerns of PVIs, by leveraging our 6-year relationship working directly with our local chapter of the National Federation of the Blind. RELEVANCE (See Instructions): 23.7 million American adults have vision loss; 1.3 million people in US are legally blind.

"Gaze-contingent computer screen magnification control for people with low vision ! Project Summary This application describes proposed research with the goal of facilitating use of a computer screen magnifier by people with low vision. Screen magnification is a well-established, popular technology for access of onscreen content. Its main shortcoming is that it requires the user to continuously control, with the mouse or trackpad, the location of the focus of magnification, in order to ensure that the magnified content of interest is within the screen viewport. This tedious process may be time-consuming and ineffective. For example, the simple task of reading the news on a web site requires continuous horizontal scrolling, which affects the experience of using this otherwise very beneficial technology, and may discourage its use, especially by those with poor manual coordination.  We propose to develop a software system that enables hands-free control of a screen magnifier. This system will rely on the user’s eye gaze (measured by a regular IR-based tracker, or from analysis of the images in a camera embedded in the screen) to update the location of the focus of magnification as desired. This research is inspired by preliminary work, which showed promising results with two simple gaze-based control algorithms, tested on three individuals with low vision.  This project will be a collaboration between the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC Santa Cruz (PI: Manduchi, Co-I: Prado) and the School of Optometry at UC Berkeley (PI: Chung). Dr. Legge from the Department of Psychology at U. Minnesota will participate as a consultant. Two human subjects studies are planned. In Study 1 with 80 low vision subjects from four different categories of visual impairment, we will investigate the failure rate of a commercial gaze tracker (Aim 1), and will record mouse tracks, gaze tracks, and images from the subjects while performing a number of tasks using two modalities of screen magnification (Aim 2). In Study 2, with the same number of subjects, we will repeat the Study 1 experiment, but using a gaze-based controller trained from the data collected in Study 1, and individually tunable for best performance (Aim 3). In addition, we will experiment with an appearance-based gaze tracker that uses images from the screen camera, thereby removing the need for specialized gaze tracking hardware, as well as with a computer tablet form factor (Aim 4). We expect that reading speed and error rate using our gaze-based controller will be no worse than using mouse-based control. If successful, this study will show that the convenience of hands-free control offered by the proposed system comes at no additional cost in terms of individual performance at the considered tasks. ! ! Project Narrative People with low vision often use screen magnification software to read on a computer screen. Since a magnifier expands the screen content beyond the physical size of the screen (the “viewport”), it is necessary to move the content using the mouse so that the portion of interest falls within the viewport. This project will facilitate use of a screen magnifier by means of a new software system that relies on the user’s own gaze to control scrolling when reading with magnification. !",Gaze-contingent computer screen magnification control for people with low vision,10053172,R01EY030952,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Apple', 'Behavior Control', 'Benchmarking', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desktop Video', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Magic', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Minnesota', 'Modality', 'Mus', 'Operating System', 'Optometry', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resort', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'computer science', 'control trial', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gaze', 'human subject', 'interest', 'motor control', 'news', 'recurrent neural network', 'sample fixation', 'software systems', 'tool', 'web page', 'web site']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R01,2020,350753,0.055483256467138684
"Vision in Natural Tasks Summary/Abstract  In the context of natural behavior, humans make continuous sequences of sensory-motor decisions to satisfy current behavioral goals, and vision must provide the information needed to achieve those goals. The proposed work examines gaze and walking decisions in locomotion in outdoor environments, taking advantage of our novel system for measuring combined eye and body movements in these contexts. Currently we have only limited understanding of the constituent tasks in natural locomotion, or the requisite information, and the proposal attempts to specify these.  in the context of natural gait, the patterns of optic flow are unexpectedly complex, raising questions about its role. The patterns of motion on the retina during locomotion depend critically on both eye and body motion, and these in turn depend on behavioral goals. Our first Aim is therefore to comprehensively describe the statistics of retinal motion patterns in a variety of terrains and task contexts. We will measure binocular eye and body movements while walking in outdoor terrains of varying roughness, crossing a busy intersection, and making coffee. These contexts will induce different gaze patterns. We will provide a comprehensive description of the motion stimulus in natural locomotion and help separate out self-motion signals from externally generated motion. These data will allow a more precise specification of the response patterns in cortical motion sensitive areas. Because of the complexity of natural motion patterns, we will re-examine the influence of optic flow on walking direction in a virtual reality environment and test alternative explanations for the role of flow.  A central task in walking is foot placement, and we will focus on identifying the image properties that make a good foothold. Stereo, structure from motion, and spatial image structure are all likely contenders. We directly investigate the role of stereo in foothold selection by examining gait patterns in stereo-deficient subjects in terrains with varying degrees of roughness. Using a different strategy, we will attempt to predict gaze locations and footholds in rough terrain using convolution neural nets (CNN’s) to identify potential search templates for footholds in rough terrain. We will describe fixation patterns from crosswalk and sidewalk navigation and attempt to make inferences about their purpose, and use Modular Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MIRL) to predict direction decisions and decompose the behavior into sub-tasks.  The collection of integrated gaze, body kinematics, and scene images in a range of natural environments is innovative, as little comparable data exists The work will be strengthened by the investigation of stereo- deficient subjects for whom there is almost no integrated eye and body data. Since much of the work in robotics has no visual input at all this should help in development of visual guidance for robots and also help better define the necessary information for individuals with impaired vision. The data set will be made publicly available. Project Narrative  The central goal of this work is to understand vision in its natural context. This is very important information in order to devise suitable vision aids and rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual impairments, and it is becoming increasingly accessible because of developments in technology for monitoring eye and body movements.

"Eliminating the human factor from stereotaxic surgeries Project Summary: The main goal of this research project is to develop a new line of new stereotaxic devices for small animal research that outperforms existing devices in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and ease of use. Advancing a tool such as an electrode, injection pipette or optical fiber through a small hole in the cranium, sometimes over long distances, and placing it precisely in a particular brain area, often much less than one millimeter in diameter, is a significant experimental challenge. Any time an investigator misses the target brain area and the experiment fails as a result, a significant amount of work is lost, additional animals get sacrificed, materials are wasted, and the pace of scientific discovery has been slowed. Even in cases when experiments succeed, they can be difficult to reproduce because many research groups rely on their most experienced lab members and their “special touch” to perform these procedures – thereby adding an element of non- quantitativeness to the procedures, effectively making the experiment less reproducible. We propose to develop a novel stereotaxic apparatus which will overcome many of these shortcomings. Our device features a radically different mechanical design which is natively compatible with both traditional and novel in-vivo techniques. We propose to combine computer 3D vision and robotics for automatic and software guided adjustments of the animal's skull. Landmarks are measured with 3D vision, based on structured illumination at a level of accuracy that has not been accomplished by any of the existing devices. This information will guide a robotic platform to position the animal for the experiment. Finally, we propose to develop an open software platform for neuronavigation that will allow investigators to use the platform with any small animal species they desire to use. Brain atlas systems for neuronavigation can either be downloaded from a cloud based site, or produced de-novo by the investigator by preparing a single set of MRI and CT scans from one sample animal. Our device will help make stereotaxic procedures more accurate and less dependent on human input and thereby increase the repeatability of experiments within a laboratory as well as the reproducibility of experiments across laboratories. Narrative: The main goal of this research project is to develop a new line of new stereotaxic devices for small animal research that outperforms existing devices in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and ease of use. These devices will help make stereotaxic procedures less dependent on human input and thereby increase the repeatability of experiments within a laboratory as well as the reproducibility of experiments across laboratories. Most importantly, they will help reduce or eliminate failed experiments due to mistargeted interventions, thereby accelerating the pace of scientific discovery.",Eliminating the human factor from stereotaxic surgeries,10080673,R41NS119079,"['3-Dimensional', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Monitor', 'Neuronavigation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Side', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age group', 'base', 'bone', 'bone imaging', 'brain tissue', 'cloud based', 'cost effective', 'cranium', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic strain', 'hexapod', 'in vivo', 'laboratory experience', 'member', 'millimeter', 'novel', 'operation', 'optical fiber', 'programs', 'prototype', 'soft tissue', 'software development', 'tool', 'virtual', 'wasting']",NINDS,POPNEURON LTD.,R41,2020,251960,0.01664399364973977
