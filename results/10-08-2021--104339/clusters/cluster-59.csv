"Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract:  The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains challenging due to its clinical heterogeneity and lengthy differential diagnosis. The incorrect assignment of a diagnosis of MS occurs in approximately 9% of newly evaluated patients and is associated with considerable clinically important, and avoidable, medical risk, morbidity, and healthcare costs. At the same time studies have demonstrated that many patients encounter a significant diagnostic delay prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of MS. In such patients early and accurate diagnosis of MS can result in prompt initiation of disease modifying therapy and consequent preventable disability. MS remains a clinical diagnosis and diagnostic criteria for MS are revised periodically, including most recently in 2017. Since implementation of the 2017 criteria, like all prior revisions, will continue to rely on subjective clinical and radiological assessments for its fulfillment, misdiagnosis will remain a risk.  New objective, automated, and clinically applicable approaches to MS diagnosis are needed. Recent preliminary data from cross-sectional pilot studies in patients with established diagnoses have shown promise for three new radiographic and three new laboratory methods to differentiate MS from other disorders. The present study will evaluate these six methods for the first time in a prospective cohort of 125 patients undergoing an initial evaluation for MS at an academic MS subspecialty center. The specificity and sensitivity of each method will be compared to fulfillment of 2017 MS diagnostic criteria at the time of initial clinical evaluation. Using diagnostic thresholds developed from this analysis, a two year post-enrollment analysis will also be performed in participants who did not meet 2017 criteria initially but did so during the subsequent two year interval to determine if the study methods could have predicted a diagnosis of MS earlier in such patients. The use of a multimodal and machine-learning approach to evaluate the integration of each of these six new methods which represent different aspects of MS neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes will also be performed during each analysis, and such a combination of radiographic and laboratory methodology may provide superior diagnostic accuracy compared to any given method alone.  Planned collaborative career development, mentoring, and advising activities will facilitate acquisition of specific advanced quantitative and qualitative research skills necessary to develop and coordinate collection of data for this large prospective cohort study to rigorously evaluate new diagnostic methods for MS and incorporate machine learning analyses. Successful completion of this study will provide experience and skills necessary to move the field of MS diagnosis forward through a planned prospective multicenter NIH R01 funded study. Project Narrative: A highly specific, sensitive, objective and automated novel diagnostic approach to multiple sclerosis (MS) is needed maximize early benefits of disease modifying therapy in patients with MS and to prevent the frequent problem of MS misdiagnosis. This project assesses three novel MRI techniques and three novel blood tests for the diagnosis of MS in a large prospective cohort undergoing a new clinical evaluation for suspect MS. While each method may show promise alone, utilization of machine learning methodology combining these approaches that represent different aspects of MS pathophysiology may demonstrate a highly accurate and clinically applicable methodology for MS diagnosis.",Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers,9646600,K02NS109340,"['Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atrophic', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'C-Peptide', 'Central Vein', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Qualitative Research', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Whole Blood', 'accurate diagnosis', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'neurofilament', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel imaging technique', 'polypeptide C', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'skills', 'specific biomarkers', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K02,2019,193783,0.2894699447004233
"Predicting Patient Outcome in Multiple Sclerosis using a Quantitative Radiomic Approach Project Summary: Multiple sclerosis (MS), a leading cause of disability in young and middle-aged adults, is a highly heterogeneous disease, with wide variations in clinical presentation, disease course and response to treatment. In order to personalize care in MS, it is important to harness its clinical heterogeneity and the diversity of its underlying pathology, and to develop models able to predict individual behavior of patients. Brain magnetic resonance images (MRI), acquired routinely in MS patients, contain information that reflects underlying pathophysiology, which may be brought into light through quantitative analyses. Radiomics, a technique well developed in oncology, converts routine medical images into mineable high-dimensional data that can be modeled to support clinical decision-making. The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that radiomic analysis, combined with careful feature selection and accurate modeling, can predict patient outcome and response to therapy using standard-of-care MRI in MS. Our hypothesis will be tested by leveraging existing 3-year imaging and clinical data from the CombiRx trial, a multi-center, phase-III investigation of combination therapy in 1008 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. We will first determine the potential for non-invasive radiomic biomarkers of disease severity in RRMS. Towards this goal, we will extract radiomic features of MS lesions from FLAIR, pre and postcontrast T1-weighted MR images using an open-source radiomic pipeline. Through appropriate feature selection, we will identify an independent radiomic feature set able to characterize individual phenotype on MRI in a selection cohort. We will then evaluate the selected features cross-sectionally to determine their efficacy in characterizing disease severity, leveraging training and validation subsets. The performance of our radiomic approach will be compared to traditional models using clinical and standard imaging markers such as lesion volume. In the second stage of this proposal, we will explore the performance of radiomic-based models to predict long-term outcome and treatment response in MS. We will build models to predict disease activity free status (DAFS) at 3 years using selected baseline radiomic features, and identify treatment response phenotypes. We will investigate and compare the performance of various machine-learning models in an unbiased manner. Finally, we will assess the effect of each therapeutic regimen on radiomic features by comparing on-treatment changes across treatment arms. This may provide evidence for treatment-specific monitoring parameters.   Project Narrative:    Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and disabling disorder of the central nervous system affecting over 1  million  individuals  in  the  United  States.  Unambiguous  and  robust  clinical  prediction  of  individual  outcome  and  treatment  response  is  deeply  needed  to  provide  personalized  medicine  to  MS  patients,  reduce disability, and minimize the burden of MS on individuals and society. Radiomics has the potential  to contribute to decision-­‐support systems in MS, by transforming routinely acquired magnetic resonance  images into mineable high-­‐dimensional data.   ",Predicting Patient Outcome in Multiple Sclerosis using a Quantitative Radiomic Approach,9824996,R03NS109715,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Risk', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'digital', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle age', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'novel', 'oncology', 'open source', 'patient response', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'response', 'routine practice', 'standard of care', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2019,88953,0.2463893143164157
"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9747390,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individual response', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'patient response', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,298872,0.2864876921024999
"ICLIC-MS for Enhancing Outcomes Research and Clinical Care in Multiple Sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive impairment, physical disability and progressive disease are common but understudied clinical outcomes that substantially impact employment and overall quality of life for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). We have recently developed and validated an assisted, web-based tool (ICLIC-MS) for systematic and longitudinal clinical outcomes data collection of MS-validated cognitive function measures, physical disability and progressive disease measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR). In response to FOA# PA-17-010, Use of Technology to Enhance Patient Outcomes and Prevent Illness, our team proposes the study of MS outcomes in a large, multi-ethnic population representative sample of more than 3,000 female and male MS cases from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health Plan Membership. We will integrate other EHR data such as important comorbid conditions, use of disease modifying therapy, MRI reports, as well as quality of life measures and employment histories. Our goals include: 1) comprehensively characterizing clinical outcomes in a large MS patient cohort; 2) developing and utilizing an integrated MS health report to enhance patient care; and 3) establishing a resource for clinical outcomes research in MS that also includes whole genomic and environmental exposure data. Findings from our proposed study represent an extraordinary opportunity to facilitate effective long-term management of MS, accelerate progress in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, predict patient trajectories and inform prevention strategies. We have assembled a team with strong expertise in clinical neurology/MS neurology, advanced epidemiologic methods, EHR structure and clinical care within a health maintenance organization, human genomics, biostatistics, and big data approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our team has developed and validated an assisted web-based interface for longitudinal clinical data collection of cognitive function measures, physical disability and depression measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

"Statistical Methods for Multilevel Multivariate Functional Studies Abstract  While imaging studies are widely used in clinical practice and research, the number of neuroimaging- based biomarkers is small. For example, in clinical trials of immunomodulatory therapies for MS, the only commonly used imaging biomarkers are the total lesion volume and the number of new and en- hancing lesions. These biomarkers are essential, but do not capture the recovery process of lesions, which is thought to decline in more severe, progressive disease. The partial or complete recovery of lesions may depend both on the ability of the brain to heal and on external factors, such as treat- ment or environmental and behavioral exposures. In this proposal we take the natural next step of proposing imaging biomarkers for MS based on the formation and change of lesions as observed on multi-sequence structural MRIs. To solve this problem we propose to address several general method- ological problems: 1) develop models and methods for the longitudinal analysis of several images of the same brain; 2) identify and estimate the length of history that is necessary to estimate recovery; 3) study the association with known biomarkers of the disease (in this case total volume and number of new and enhancing lesions); 4) develop methods that are robust to changes in imaging protocols that inevitably arise in longitudinal neuroimaging studies; and 5) develop the computational tools that allow for sophisticated methods to be implemented seamlessly in practice. While our scientiﬁc problem is focused, the proposed statistical methods are general and can be applied to a wide variety of longitu- dinal neuroimaging studies. For example, there are many ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging studies, including the ADNI, AIBL, HBC, and MISTIE, where our methods could be used to study subtle or large changes in lesions or in white and gray matter intensities. Project narrative. The project provides statistical analysis methods for quantiﬁcation of the evolution in the intensity of brain lesions on multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Methods are motivated by the need to develop new neuroimaging-based biomarkers for multiple sclerosis (MS), but can be applied to other types of brain diseases including stroke, Alzheimer disease, and cancer.",Statistical Methods for Multilevel Multivariate Functional Studies,9635802,R01NS060910,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Names', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'biomarker validation', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'gray matter', 'healing', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal database', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroimaging', 'non-Gaussian model', 'personalized approach', 'repaired', 'serial imaging', 'software development', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,633289,0.1189814087701883
"Predicting contrast enhancement in multiple sclerosis with real time texture analysis Description: Identification of active lesions is critical for the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Currently this identification is based on post-contrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, there are safety concerns with repeated administration of gadolinium –based contrast agents (GBCAs). Thus, there is critical need for identifying active lesions without the use of GBCA. In this application we propose to identify the active lesions without administering GBCA using texture analysis (TA) using multi- modal non-contrast MRI and support vector machine (SVM) learning. A unique feature of this proposal is that the results will be analyzed using MRI data acquired on a large cohort of MS patients (~1000) as a part of phase III, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial (CombiRx). In addition texture features will be identified that can predict lesions that convert into tissue destructive lesions, so called black holes. This has important clinical implications since there is correlative evidence that balk holes are associated with clinical disability. A novelty of this project lies in performing texture analysis in real time that allows the physician to make the decision about administering GBCA on the spot while the patient is still in the scanner. This greatly helps in eliminating and/or minimizing the number of times GBCA needs to be administered. For real time analysis, the necessary infrastructure that includes automatic processing pipeline and integration of the MRI scanner with high performance computational resources located at Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) in Austin. Finally to establish real time TA as a viable alternative to GBCA administration for identifying active lesions, the developed methods will be prospectively applied to MS patients undergoing MRI scans as a part of routine clinical management. Public health relevance: Gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) are routinely used for identifying active lesions in multiple sclerosis patients. However, there are safety concerns with repeated administration of GBCA. This proposal uses novel real time analysis for identifying lesions that are likely to enhance on pre- contrast MRI. Considering the large number of MS patients who are frequently scanned with GBCA, this proposal has a high degree of clinical relevance.",Predicting contrast enhancement in multiple sclerosis with real time texture analysis,9650821,R56NS105857,"['Advanced Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Evaluation', 'Gadolinium', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neuraxis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protons', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Spottings', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'attenuation', 'austin', 'base', 'black hole', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'contrast enhanced', 'density', 'disability', 'high end computer', 'imaging facilities', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'prospective', 'public health relevance']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R56,2018,535749,0.10154105571188841
"Retinal eye-tracking for the prognosis and monitoring of multiple sclerosis Abstract The goal of this project is to validate an innovative, highly sensitive retinal eye-tracking technology, the tracking scanning laser ophthalmoscope (TSLO), as a prognostic and monitoring tool for neurodegenerative disorders, namely multiple sclerosis (MS). The applications of effective treatments for multiple sclerosis are constrained by (1) the absence of methods for early detection and (2) quantitative, highly sensitive methods monitoring deficits early in disease course when treatment may have a better chance of success. As already demonstrated, the TSLO is capable of rapidly assessing and measuring the extraordinarily fine, microscopic motion of the human eye during fixation in MS patients. Fixational eye movements are neurally-encoded, involuntary movements that require the coordination of many areas of the central nervous system. Given the TSLO’s theoretical sensitivity to change (0.2 arcminutes) and its precision of measurement - fixational eye movements have the potential utility for tracking neurodegenerative disease progression at an unprecedented scale. With the advent of the new FDA-approved MS treatment targeting B-cells (ocrelizumab), clinical tools are now desperately needed to not only assess treatment efficacy, but to objectively assess patient disability at the earliest stage of disease in order to cut relapse rates and prevent irrevocable disability. In this project, we will determine the optimal fixational eye motion metrics to distinguish patients from controls, establish the relationship between clinical disease severity measures and fixational eye movement deficits as defined by the TSLO system, and to use machine learning algorithms to further strengthen our fixational metrics. Narrative The goal of our project is to clinically validate a retinal imaging and eye-tracking technology, the tracking scanning laser ophthalmoscope (TSLO), as a prognostic and monitoring tool for neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

"Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) rests on clinical symptoms and examinations as  outlined in the revised McDonald’s criteria supported by appropriate magnetic resonance imaging findings and  other laboratory tests. The need for early diagnosis is clearly emphasized in a position paper produced in 2015  by MS Brain Health organization called “Brain health, Time matters in multiple sclerosis’ which is endorsed by  the major organizations and foundations that advocate for MS research, providers and patients including  Accelerated Cure Project (ACP), Americans Committed for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis  (ACTRIMS), The Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), European Brain Council (EBC), European  Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), European Multiple Sclerosis Platform  (EMSP), International Society of Neuroimmunology (ISNI), International Organization of Multiple Sclerosis  Nurses (IOMSN), National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), and Multiple Sclerosis Trust (MS). To cite from  their executive summary page: (1) “A therapeutic strategy that offers the best chance of preserving brain  and spinal cord tissue early in the disease course needs to be widely accepted – and urgently adopted.”  (2) “Significant delays often occur before a person with symptoms suggestive of MS sees a neurologist  for diagnosis and treatment.” (3) “Early intervention is vital.” (bold type face is theirs, not ours).   The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be  built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for  several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not  code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic  complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases  that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that  disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In  this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease  than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on MS as a disease category and have identified and validated MS associated  differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and  exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose  to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include  1) subjects with RRMS, 2) healthy controls, 3) neurologic disease controls including both inflammatory and non- inflammatory disorders, and 4) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S.  and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to  distinguish the MS cohorts from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) is a subjective diagnosis based largely on clinical  symptoms and MRI findings disseminated in time and space.

"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability.

"ICLIC-MS for Enhancing Outcomes Research and Clinical Care in Multiple Sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive impairment, physical disability and progressive disease are common but understudied clinical outcomes that substantially impact employment and overall quality of life for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). We have recently developed and validated an assisted, web-based tool (ICLIC-MS) for systematic and longitudinal clinical outcomes data collection of MS-validated cognitive function measures, physical disability and progressive disease measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR). In response to FOA# PA-17-010, Use of Technology to Enhance Patient Outcomes and Prevent Illness, our team proposes the study of MS outcomes in a large, multi-ethnic population representative sample of more than 3,000 female and male MS cases from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health Plan Membership. We will integrate other EHR data such as important comorbid conditions, use of disease modifying therapy, MRI reports, as well as quality of life measures and employment histories. Our goals include: 1) comprehensively characterizing clinical outcomes in a large MS patient cohort; 2) developing and utilizing an integrated MS health report to enhance patient care; and 3) establishing a resource for clinical outcomes research in MS that also includes whole genomic and environmental exposure data. Findings from our proposed study represent an extraordinary opportunity to facilitate effective long-term management of MS, accelerate progress in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, predict patient trajectories and inform prevention strategies. We have assembled a team with strong expertise in clinical neurology/MS neurology, advanced epidemiologic methods, EHR structure and clinical care within a health maintenance organization, human genomics, biostatistics, and big data approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our team has developed and validated an assisted web-based interface for longitudinal clinical data collection of cognitive function measures, physical disability and depression measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

"Statistical Methods for Multilevel Multivariate Functional Studies Abstract  While imaging studies are widely used in clinical practice and research, the number of neuroimaging- based biomarkers is small. For example, in clinical trials of immunomodulatory therapies for MS, the only commonly used imaging biomarkers are the total lesion volume and the number of new and en- hancing lesions. These biomarkers are essential, but do not capture the recovery process of lesions, which is thought to decline in more severe, progressive disease. The partial or complete recovery of lesions may depend both on the ability of the brain to heal and on external factors, such as treat- ment or environmental and behavioral exposures. In this proposal we take the natural next step of proposing imaging biomarkers for MS based on the formation and change of lesions as observed on multi-sequence structural MRIs. To solve this problem we propose to address several general method- ological problems: 1) develop models and methods for the longitudinal analysis of several images of the same brain; 2) identify and estimate the length of history that is necessary to estimate recovery; 3) study the association with known biomarkers of the disease (in this case total volume and number of new and enhancing lesions); 4) develop methods that are robust to changes in imaging protocols that inevitably arise in longitudinal neuroimaging studies; and 5) develop the computational tools that allow for sophisticated methods to be implemented seamlessly in practice. While our scientiﬁc problem is focused, the proposed statistical methods are general and can be applied to a wide variety of longitu- dinal neuroimaging studies. For example, there are many ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging studies, including the ADNI, AIBL, HBC, and MISTIE, where our methods could be used to study subtle or large changes in lesions or in white and gray matter intensities. Project narrative. The project provides statistical analysis methods for quantiﬁcation of the evolution in the intensity of brain lesions on multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Methods are motivated by the need to develop new neuroimaging-based biomarkers for multiple sclerosis (MS), but can be applied to other types of brain diseases including stroke, Alzheimer disease, and cancer.",Statistical Methods for Multilevel Multivariate Functional Studies,9492705,R01NS060910,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Names', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'biomarker validation', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'gray matter', 'healing', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal database', 'neuroimaging', 'non-Gaussian model', 'personalized approach', 'repaired', 'software development', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,637414,0.1189814087701883
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) rests on clinical symptoms and examinations as  outlined in the revised McDonald’s criteria supported by appropriate magnetic resonance imaging findings and  other laboratory tests. The need for early diagnosis is clearly emphasized in a position paper produced in 2015  by MS Brain Health organization called “Brain health, Time matters in multiple sclerosis’ which is endorsed by  the major organizations and foundations that advocate for MS research, providers and patients including  Accelerated Cure Project (ACP), Americans Committed for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis  (ACTRIMS), The Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), European Brain Council (EBC), European  Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), European Multiple Sclerosis Platform  (EMSP), International Society of Neuroimmunology (ISNI), International Organization of Multiple Sclerosis  Nurses (IOMSN), National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), and Multiple Sclerosis Trust (MS). To cite from  their executive summary page: (1) “A therapeutic strategy that offers the best chance of preserving brain  and spinal cord tissue early in the disease course needs to be widely accepted – and urgently adopted.”  (2) “Significant delays often occur before a person with symptoms suggestive of MS sees a neurologist  for diagnosis and treatment.” (3) “Early intervention is vital.” (bold type face is theirs, not ours).   The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be  built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for  several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not  code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic  complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases  that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that  disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In  this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease  than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on MS as a disease category and have identified and validated MS associated  differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and  exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose  to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include  1) subjects with RRMS, 2) healthy controls, 3) neurologic disease controls including both inflammatory and non- inflammatory disorders, and 4) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S.  and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to  distinguish the MS cohorts from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) is a subjective diagnosis based largely on clinical  symptoms and MRI findings disseminated in time and space. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate this diagnosis  is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs  with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that  classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess  greater accuracy to identify presence of MS in a subject earlier than is currently available leading to  preservation of ‘brain health’.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis,9405679,R44AI124766,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advocate', 'American', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Demyelinations', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Europe', 'European', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Geographic Distribution', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Investigation', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Laboratories', 'Latin American', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Messenger RNA', 'Middle East', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Northern Africa', 'Nurses', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'RNA', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trust', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'brain health', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'infancy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimmunology', 'phase 1 study']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2017,504933,0.1818458474694082

"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.",Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis,8829259,R01ES017080,"['6p21', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'California', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chromosomes', 'Chronology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MHC Class II Genes', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention strategy', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'prenatal', 'rare variant', 'tool']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2015,572704,0.3246794658584835
"Segmentation and volumetric quantification of thalamic nuclei for assessing MS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The thalamus plays a key role in integrating sensory information for further processing in the basal ganglia and cortex. In multiple sclerosis (MS), long thought to be primarily a white matter disease, it has recently been shown that cognitive decline is more strongly related to thalamic volume than to white matter magnetic resonance image (MRI) lesion load. Since the thalamus is made up of nuclei having specific physical connections within the brain, it may be possible to relate physical changes in thalamic nuclei caused by MS to specific cognitive, behavioral, or disease subtype differences. This grant proposes to develop an automated method and associated software tool to carry out thalamic nuclei parcellation using MRI. Specifically, it is proposed to: 1) optimize the computation of thalamic features from anatomical and diffusion MRI; 2) develop an integrated, multi-nuclear thalamus segmentation algorithm; 3) optimize the algorithm parameters using manual delineations; and 4) carry out a pilot study using an existing MRI database comprising 99 normal controls and 226 MS patients. The work builds on previous methods that exploit topology and connectivity in order to improve segmentation robustness. The primary innovation is to provide a coordinated multi-object approach that integrates intensity information from T1-weighted MRI with orientation information and connectivity information obtained from diffusion MRI. Primary diffusion directions will be mapped to a five- dimensional space in order to cluster nuclei by diffusion orientation and use this information in the parcellation algorithm. A machine learning approach applied to manual delineations will be used to learn boundary-specific properties that will be used to carry out a joint parcellation approach. The algorithm will be designed for conventional three tesla clinical MRI and will be validated using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio seven tesla MRI on 15 subjects scanned contemporaneously with their three tesla scans. The pilot study will use 822 scans of 305 participants, and will examine longitudinal stability of the algorithm and a cross-sectional univariate statistical analysis relatng thalamic nuclei (or nuclear groups) volumes to various clinical measures including disease subtype, disease duration, visual acuity, and two standard MS composite disability scores. An exploratory principal component analysis of multiple thalamic nuclear volumes will be carried out to look for patterns of atrophy and their relationships to various clinical measures. The algorithm will be made publicly available as open source code on the NITRC website so that the entire neuroscience community will be able to use the algorithm to study other diseases or modify and extend it for other applications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop software for the automatic segmentation and measurement of thalamic nuclei, which are thought to be affected by multiple sclerosis (MS). With this software applied to clinical magnetic resonance scans, the size of the thalamus and its nuclei will be available as biomarkers to track both the progression of MS and the success of its treatment. Open source software written in a highly portable language will be made available to the research community at the conclusion of the research grant.            ",Segmentation and volumetric quantification of thalamic nuclei for assessing MS,8656167,R21NS082891,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Epilepsy', 'Equilibrium', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Grant', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Solvents', 'Source Code', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Diseases', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tremor', 'Visual Acuity', 'Weight', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'falls', 'gray matter', 'illness length', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'success', 'web site', 'white matter']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,228293,0.17220586925278847

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.

"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis.

"Multimodal Machine-Learning and High Performance Computing Strategies for Big MS Proteomics Data Project Abstract/Summary Mass spectrometry (MS) data is high-dimensional data that is used for large-scale system biology proteomics. The current state of the art mass spectrometers can generate thousands of spectra from a single organism and experiment. This high-dimensional data is processed using database searches and denovo algorithms with varying degrees of success. The overarching objective of this study is to develop, test, integrate and evaluate novel image-processing and deep-learning algorithms that will allow us to deduce and identify reliable peptide sequences in a definitive and quantitative fashion. Our long-term goal is to improve on identification of MS based proteomics data using novel and scalable algorithms. The objective of this proposal is to investigate, design and implement machine-learning deep-learning algorithms for identification of peptides from MS data. Since deep-learning is very good at discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data it will be ideal solution for discovering dark proteomics data and more accurate deduction of peptides. We predict that the integration of these methods, along with traditional numerical algorithms, will lead to a multimodal fusion-based approach for an optimized and accurate peptide deduction system for large-scale MS data. Further, we will design and implement data augmentation, memory-efficient indexing, and high-performance computing (HPC) to achieve these outcomes more efficiently with a shorter computational time. Therefore, this new line of investigation is significant since it has the potential to improve on long-stalled effort to increase accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of MS data analysis and search tools. The proximate expected outcome of this work is a novel set of deep-learning and image-processing tools which will allow much better insight in MS based proteomics data. The results will have an important positive impact immediately because these proposed research tasks will lay the groundwork to develop a new class of algorithms and will provide rapid, high-throughput, sensitive, and reproducible and reliable tools for MS based proteomics. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding Mass Spectrometry (MS) based proteomics can allow systematic analysis of thousands of proteins with the promise of discovering new protein biomarkers for different disease conditions and better understanding of human systems biology. Because of high-dimensionality of the big data generated from MS machines efficient, accurate and reproducible tools are required to mine and analyze the data and is the subject of this proposal. Such high-performance tools will be instrumental in elucidating the microbiome which affects virtually all aspects of human health. Therefore, this proposal is relevant to NIH’s broader mission which support fundamental and innovative research strategies which can become the basis of protecting and improving human health.",Multimodal Machine-Learning and High Performance Computing Strategies for Big MS Proteomics Data,9973317,R01GM134384,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Galaxy', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mass spectrometer', 'microbiome', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'program dissemination', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein biomarkers', 'reproductive', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'vector', 'virtual']",NIGMS,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,322438,0.1125537949590182
"Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract:  The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains challenging due to its clinical heterogeneity and lengthy differential diagnosis. The incorrect assignment of a diagnosis of MS occurs in approximately 9% of newly evaluated patients and is associated with considerable clinically important, and avoidable, medical risk, morbidity, and healthcare costs. At the same time studies have demonstrated that many patients encounter a significant diagnostic delay prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of MS. In such patients early and accurate diagnosis of MS can result in prompt initiation of disease modifying therapy and consequent preventable disability. MS remains a clinical diagnosis and diagnostic criteria for MS are revised periodically, including most recently in 2017. Since implementation of the 2017 criteria, like all prior revisions, will continue to rely on subjective clinical and radiological assessments for its fulfillment, misdiagnosis will remain a risk.  New objective, automated, and clinically applicable approaches to MS diagnosis are needed. Recent preliminary data from cross-sectional pilot studies in patients with established diagnoses have shown promise for three new radiographic and three new laboratory methods to differentiate MS from other disorders. The present study will evaluate these six methods for the first time in a prospective cohort of 125 patients undergoing an initial evaluation for MS at an academic MS subspecialty center. The specificity and sensitivity of each method will be compared to fulfillment of 2017 MS diagnostic criteria at the time of initial clinical evaluation. Using diagnostic thresholds developed from this analysis, a two year post-enrollment analysis will also be performed in participants who did not meet 2017 criteria initially but did so during the subsequent two year interval to determine if the study methods could have predicted a diagnosis of MS earlier in such patients. The use of a multimodal and machine-learning approach to evaluate the integration of each of these six new methods which represent different aspects of MS neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes will also be performed during each analysis, and such a combination of radiographic and laboratory methodology may provide superior diagnostic accuracy compared to any given method alone.  Planned collaborative career development, mentoring, and advising activities will facilitate acquisition of specific advanced quantitative and qualitative research skills necessary to develop and coordinate collection of data for this large prospective cohort study to rigorously evaluate new diagnostic methods for MS and incorporate machine learning analyses. Successful completion of this study will provide experience and skills necessary to move the field of MS diagnosis forward through a planned prospective multicenter NIH R01 funded study. Project Narrative: A highly specific, sensitive, objective and automated novel diagnostic approach to multiple sclerosis (MS) is needed maximize early benefits of disease modifying therapy in patients with MS and to prevent the frequent problem of MS misdiagnosis. This project assesses three novel MRI techniques and three novel blood tests for the diagnosis of MS in a large prospective cohort undergoing a new clinical evaluation for suspect MS. While each method may show promise alone, utilization of machine learning methodology combining these approaches that represent different aspects of MS pathophysiology may demonstrate a highly accurate and clinically applicable methodology for MS diagnosis.",Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers,9843746,K02NS109340,"['Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atrophic', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'C-Peptide', 'Central Vein', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Qualitative Research', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Whole Blood', 'accurate diagnosis', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'neurofilament', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel imaging technique', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'skills', 'specific biomarkers', 'support vector machine', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K02,2020,193783,0.2894699447004233
"Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary  In this project, we propose a novel T1 and T2 quantification method that generates quantitative T1 or T2 maps from weighted MR images. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used as a tool to diagnose Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and track lesional changes over time. Because MRI has various contrasts that display different information about the underlying tissue microstructure and physiology, it can potentially be used as a tool to predict MS disease progression and even disability. However, there is no known measure derived from MR images of MS that correlates well with clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS). Previous efforts to correlate MRI features and EDSS have included calculating total lesion load on T1- and T2-weighted images, measuring the variations in the magnetic transfer ration of normal-appearing brain tissues, and calculating cerebral atrophy, each with a varying level of success. Yet, there has been little study of the evolution of relaxation times of the lesions over time and how it relates to disability. Because changes in the T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) relaxation times of a tissue can reflect pathological changes in that tissue over time, quantitative T1 and T2 maps derived from MR images may be more indicative of microscopic changes that manifest as disability in MS patients.  The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) develop and validate novel T1 and T2 quantification method on spin-echo MR images, (2) extend the novel quantification method to common MS imaging sequences, and (3) apply the novel quantification method to MS datasets to predict EDSS using machine learning. Aim 1 will involve the validation of the quantification pipeline on both T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo MR images in vivo, resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the novel quantification method. Aim 2 will extend the quantification pipeline to include commonly used and more complicated MS imaging sequences, again resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the quantification method. Aim 3 will use the quantification pipeline to compare machine learning algorithms with and without quantification to determine the added value of quantification in the imaging of MS. Additionally, Aim 3 will result in a predictive machine learning model utilizing multiple imaging contrasts for the prediction of disability in MS. These results will provide a more thorough understanding of the role of MR quantification in the evaluation of neurological diseases, such as MS, and will offer a scientific foundation to extend the use of MR quantification as a potential imaging biomarker for other diseases and pathologies. Project Narrative The proposed research aims to develop and validate a T1 and T2 quantification method using internal reference values derived from T1- or T2-weighted MR images. This method will be applied to weighted images of patients who have been diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis and input into various classification algorithms to determine which method is most predictive of worsening clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score. By doing this, we will determine the impact of this novel quantification method as a tool for both the analysis of patients with Multiple Sclerosis as well as a tool for the normalization of big MR datasets before being input into machine learning algorithms.",Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1,10154293,F31NS118930,"['Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Attenuated', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demyelinations', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neuraxis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'classification algorithm', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'data harmonization', 'digital', 'disability', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2020,45520,0.10722810254659296
"Predicting Patient Outcome in Multiple Sclerosis using a Quantitative Radiomic Approach Project Summary: Multiple sclerosis (MS), a leading cause of disability in young and middle-aged adults, is a highly heterogeneous disease, with wide variations in clinical presentation, disease course and response to treatment. In order to personalize care in MS, it is important to harness its clinical heterogeneity and the diversity of its underlying pathology, and to develop models able to predict individual behavior of patients. Brain magnetic resonance images (MRI), acquired routinely in MS patients, contain information that reflects underlying pathophysiology, which may be brought into light through quantitative analyses. Radiomics, a technique well developed in oncology, converts routine medical images into mineable high-dimensional data that can be modeled to support clinical decision-making. The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that radiomic analysis, combined with careful feature selection and accurate modeling, can predict patient outcome and response to therapy using standard-of-care MRI in MS. Our hypothesis will be tested by leveraging existing 3-year imaging and clinical data from the CombiRx trial, a multi-center, phase-III investigation of combination therapy in 1008 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. We will first determine the potential for non-invasive radiomic biomarkers of disease severity in RRMS. Towards this goal, we will extract radiomic features of MS lesions from FLAIR, pre and postcontrast T1-weighted MR images using an open-source radiomic pipeline. Through appropriate feature selection, we will identify an independent radiomic feature set able to characterize individual phenotype on MRI in a selection cohort. We will then evaluate the selected features cross-sectionally to determine their efficacy in characterizing disease severity, leveraging training and validation subsets. The performance of our radiomic approach will be compared to traditional models using clinical and standard imaging markers such as lesion volume. In the second stage of this proposal, we will explore the performance of radiomic-based models to predict long-term outcome and treatment response in MS. We will build models to predict disease activity free status (DAFS) at 3 years using selected baseline radiomic features, and identify treatment response phenotypes. We will investigate and compare the performance of various machine-learning models in an unbiased manner. Finally, we will assess the effect of each therapeutic regimen on radiomic features by comparing on-treatment changes across treatment arms. This may provide evidence for treatment-specific monitoring parameters.   Project Narrative:    Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and disabling disorder of the central nervous system affecting over 1  million  individuals  in  the  United  States.  Unambiguous  and  robust  clinical  prediction  of  individual  outcome  and  treatment  response  is  deeply  needed  to  provide  personalized  medicine  to  MS  patients,  reduce disability, and minimize the burden of MS on individuals and society. Radiomics has the potential  to contribute to decision-­‐support systems in MS, by transforming routinely acquired magnetic resonance  images into mineable high-­‐dimensional data.   ",Predicting Patient Outcome in Multiple Sclerosis using a Quantitative Radiomic Approach,9979980,R03NS109715,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Risk', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'digital', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'feature selection', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'response', 'routine practice', 'standard of care', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2020,81671,0.2463893143164157
"Prediction of risk of disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity in MS utilizing multimodal prediction algorithms Project Summary:  Multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibits a markedly heterogeneous and unpredictable course, with a clinical spectrum ranging from very mild forms of the disease in some patients (often termed “benign MS”) to an aggressive disease course with rapid accumulation of disability in others. Furthermore, there appears to be significant inter-individual variability in the responses to the many available disease-modifying therapies (DMT). A variety of factors have been proposed to be associated with the disease course in MS, including demographics, lifestyle factors, clinical characteristics, MRI-derived measures, and elevated serum neurofilament light chain (NfL), among others. It remains unclear though if these factors are complementary or redundant in their predictive value. Moreover, there is a lack of validated tools to accurately predict, at an individual level, future inflammatory disease activity or disability worsening. This is largely due to the lack of datasets with sufficient size, breadth and representativeness. The use of electronic medical records (EMR) has dramatically increased in recent years, enabling the capture of a wide variety of data measures from large numbers of individuals. Furthermore, the development and refinement of statistical machine learning methods has revolutionized the approach to analysis of such high-dimensional datasets. This background provides a unique opportunity to leverage and analyze “big data” in order to develop clinical risk prediction algorithms and personalized medicine tools in MS.  Multiple Sclerosis Partners Advancing Technology and Health Solutions (MS PATHS) is a network of 10 MS centers that have standardized elements of their clinical practice to implement a centralized health information exchange architecture. MS PATHS was designed around the concept of a learning health system (LHS), merging research with ongoing patient care by collecting standardized clinical and imaging data during routine medical visits. As of August, 2019, >15,000 patients have opted to participate in MS PATHS. Thus, the MS PATHS network is an ideal, deeply phenotyped, “real-world”, large population of people with MS, in which clinically relevant predictive algorithms may be developed and validated.  The goal of the current project is to develop and validate multi-modal predictive algorithms of clinically relevant disease outcomes in MS. We hypothesize that integrating a wide variety of potential predictors, including demographics, clinical characteristics (including current/historical DMT use), comorbidities/lifestyle factors, MRI- derived measures and laboratory data (including serum NfL) will lead to the development and validation of algorithms that may accurately predict future clinical disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity. Furthermore, this approach will allow the assessment of the individual contribution of specific predictors to the developed predictive algorithms, and may aid with the identification of novel risk factors of disease severity in MS. Project Narrative Successful completion of this project will lead to the development and dissemination of clinically relevant predictive algorithms to enable personalized risk assessment and therapeutic decision-making in MS, provide the means to optimize selection/stratification of participants in clinical trials, and will also provide insight regarding the interactions and relative importance of putative prognostic factors in MS.",Prediction of risk of disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity in MS utilizing multimodal prediction algorithms,10039145,K23NS117883,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'Benign', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Elements', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'design', 'dexterity', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'foot', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'neurofilament', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'performance tests', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'processing speed', 'prognostic', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'walking speed']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,199260,0.2436751733152335
"Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-β, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection. PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects over 400,000 individuals in the United States and creates a high socioeconomic burden as a leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Because not all patients respond the same way to a specific medication, physicians and MS patients often lose precious time searching for effective treatment with serially testing of costly medications. An individually tailored treatment can ensure early start of effective medication that can prevent relapse and progression of disability. Ultimately, this project will help gain insights into the factors that determine treatment response and enable physicians to match an individual MS patient's clinical and genomic profile with uniquely tailored therapy to maximize effectiveness, delay disease progression and reduce overall cost.",Integrating EHR and Genomics to Predict Multiple Sclerosis Drug Response,9963407,R01NS098023,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Fumarates', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injectable', 'Interferon-beta', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'copolymer 1', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'individual response', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'patient response', 'phenome', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,340616,0.2864876921024999
"Establishing the Role of Genetic Variation in Vitamin D Regulated Gene Expression in MS Pathogenesis and Severity Project Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease that destroys the protective myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells, and its cause is unknown. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, leading to the hypothesis that sun exposure, and consequently vitamin D exposure, has a protective effect on MS risk. Recent studies utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis have demonstrated strong evidence for a causal role of low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in MS pathogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the association are unknown. It is well established that 25(OH)D signaling operates through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. VDRs recognize specific binding sites in DNA, leading to activation or suppression of a target gene. Previous research has found that genetic variation of tagging SNPs (VDR-BVs) within these VDR binding sites, can alter binding affinity. These VDR-BVs are enriched in genomic regions associated with MS, as well as with several other autoimmune diseases, which suggests regulation of specific genes mediated by vitamin D could affect MS risk and severity. No formal investigation of genetic variation of individual VDR-BVs in MS cases and controls has been reported and VDR-BVs are strong candidates to investigate for genetic variation relevant to MS. The overall objective of this F31 application is to estimate the effect of VDR-BVs on MS risk and severity. We hypothesize that genetic variation in VDR-BVs is associated with MS susceptibility and severity, and further, that the effect of this genetic variation on MS is modulated by bioavailability of vitamin D. Our approach will use a dataset of approximately 10,000 clinically definite MS cases and 35,000 controls frequency matched on age and race/ethnicity with whole genome genotypes, demographic, clinical, and environmental exposure data and will: 1) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs near established MS risk loci and MS risk and severity; 2) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs across the human genome and MS risk and severity; and 3) Replicate findings in independent datasets of MS cases and controls and combine replicated associations across all datasets via meta-analysis. VDR-BVs were previously identified through ChIP-seq analysis in Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines and we will use machine learning to prioritize candidate VDR-BVs for Aim 2. Analyses will incorporate a genetic instrumental variable as measure of 25(OH)D bioavailability to test for interaction between VDR-BVs and 25(OH)D bioavailability. Results from the proposed aims will determine whether MS GWAS findings are partially explained by genetic variation in VDR binding affinity, identify genetic risk factors for MS related to vitamin D, and identify new genes and regulatory pathways involved in the development of MS. Ultimately, the goal of this work understand the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects this immune- mediated neurological disorder. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease that results in significant disability and decreased quality of life with both genetic and environmental risk factors. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, and recent research has demonstrated evidence supporting a causal role for low vitamin D in MS risk and disease severity.

"ICLIC-MS for Enhancing Outcomes Research and Clinical Care in Multiple Sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive impairment, physical disability and progressive disease are common but understudied clinical outcomes that substantially impact employment and overall quality of life for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). We have recently developed and validated an assisted, web-based tool (ICLIC-MS) for systematic and longitudinal clinical outcomes data collection of MS-validated cognitive function measures, physical disability and progressive disease measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR). In response to FOA# PA-17-010, Use of Technology to Enhance Patient Outcomes and Prevent Illness, our team proposes the study of MS outcomes in a large, multi-ethnic population representative sample of more than 3,000 female and male MS cases from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health Plan Membership. We will integrate other EHR data such as important comorbid conditions, use of disease modifying therapy, MRI reports, as well as quality of life measures and employment histories. Our goals include: 1) comprehensively characterizing clinical outcomes in a large MS patient cohort; 2) developing and utilizing an integrated MS health report to enhance patient care; and 3) establishing a resource for clinical outcomes research in MS that also includes whole genomic and environmental exposure data. Findings from our proposed study represent an extraordinary opportunity to facilitate effective long-term management of MS, accelerate progress in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, predict patient trajectories and inform prevention strategies. We have assembled a team with strong expertise in clinical neurology/MS neurology, advanced epidemiologic methods, EHR structure and clinical care within a health maintenance organization, human genomics, biostatistics, and big data approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our team has developed and validated an assisted web-based interface for longitudinal clinical data collection of cognitive function measures, physical disability and depression measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
